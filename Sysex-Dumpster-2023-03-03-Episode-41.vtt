WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.640
 - Damn, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.160
 fucking no.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.120
 - Greg, that's me.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.400
 - What episode is this?

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.280
 - Dave, yes, Nick.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.160
 - This is episode 41.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.000
 - It is.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 - Oh, all right.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.360
 - We've done this 41 fucking times.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.000
 Wow, when does it ever end?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.620
 When we all die.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.840
 - It'll be close to six, it'll be six years this fall.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.680
 - Jesus.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.760
 - Which is kinda like, yeah, it's at least five.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.880
 - I'll have to check.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.040
 That's nuts.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.880
 - Yeah.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.920
 - Who would've thought we had that much to talk about?

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.920
 - Keeps going.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.440
 - The trash just keeps coming.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.920
 - Yeah, it's endless.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.080
 The endless dumpster dive.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.520
 - So yeah, this is sorta not related to that,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 but it occurred to me today, this morning,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.200
 that I've had a very weird sonic week.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.320
 - In a good way?

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.160
 - Ew!

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.520
 - I'll leave that up for you to decide.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.800
 - Almost basically to the minute a week ago,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.560
 started out this week at the Monster Truck Rally

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.080
 in downtown Pittsburgh.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.920
 - Yeah.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.760
 - Yes.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.960
 - It was a good start.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.800
 - As one should.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.280
 - It was just, it's just cacophonic.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.240
 It's just, it's so loud and it is,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.560
 I mean, it's garbage.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.280
 It's truly horrific.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.520
 I mean, it fills the arena with fumes,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.080
 but it's as a noise show, it's stellar.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.080
 Follow that up a couple days later,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.600
 the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.000
 Yo-yo, mom performing.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.840
 - Yes.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.160
 - And that was completely different, like 180.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.000
 - It was beautiful.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760
 It really was astounding.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.880
 And the first part,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.000
 started with a Serjay, I'm gonna fuck this name up.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.840
 - Go for it.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.840
 - Prokoviev?

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.640
 - Sounds good to me.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.800
 - Fair enough.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.080
 They did the Romeo and Juliet Opus.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.280
 It's fucking fire.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.440
 - It's really, it's a beautiful piece.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.600
 - Good drops?

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.680
 - Oh, it was classical.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.720
 So like the buildup is like 12 minutes long

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.120
 and then there's a drop.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.640
 - Was that to celebrate the new Skrillex album?

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.960
 (laughing)

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.640
 - Skrillex, I don't believe was an attendance.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.360
 I didn't see them.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.120
 - He did just drop a new album.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.960
 - Yeah.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.800
 - Yesterday.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.640
 - Yeah.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.120
 - Are you excited?

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.720
 - Read my Facebook.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.640
 What does that say?

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.280
 - It's the first album on 10 years day.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.120
 - Yeah.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.360
 - It's been 10 fucking years.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.200
 - Oh yeah.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.120
 - It accompanies the rebranding of Skrillex.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.960
 - Yeah.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.880
 - No more brostep.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.800
 - Oh, what's the move now?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.960
 - I listened to the first track and it was House.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.800
 - Oh, okay.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.320
 - With dubstep elements.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.040
 - 'Cause he's doing like the back to back to back

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.640
 with Fortet and Fred again.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.160
 And they like just played on the lot radio yesterday.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.000
 - Okay.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.320
 - So it's like his entry into the, you know, other side

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.920
 of one other other side, but like the other,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.320
 one of the other worlds of dance music in like,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.120
 short hair now, he looks like, you know,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.120
 dressed in black looking like, looking like,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.520
 he could go into Beargut and it wouldn't be too bad.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.320
 - Right, except the fact that like,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.800
 he's always gonna be Skrillex.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.640
 So that's, that's, baggage is gonna be very hard to unload.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.480
 - Yeah.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.040
 - He's trying to leave the brostep behind him.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.440
 They've seen the past, he's turned his back on that.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.280
 It's a new man.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.480
 - Turned a new, a new leaf.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.400
 - Yeah.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.040
 - Give him a chance, Dave.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.880
 - I mean, I will listen to it.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.720
 - I'm just joking.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.920
 - I will listen to it out of curiosity.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.040
 My faith that this is.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.920
 - I got about 30 seconds into it.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.760
 - Okay.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.600
 - I'm gonna turn it off.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.440
 - Yeah.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.160
 - Now he's gonna be in the basement of lab

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.200
 and Beargut and taking piss in his mouth.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.760
 (laughing)

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.240
 Listening to fucking Boris pound the room out

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.200
 and fucking, it's a different world, man.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.920
 You're not cleaning up cake pieces

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.240
 when Steve Aoki's done and you get back in the mix

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.520
 and fucking Coachella.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.480
 (laughing)

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.000
 - Not today, man.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.120
 - Well, hopefully he's listening to the cautionary tale

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.960
 that you provided.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.360
 - You should have thought.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.640
 In the basement of a German fucking industrial building.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.040
 - The day after this episode goes live,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.160
 you just see that headlines,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.400
 Skrillex calls it quits.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.360
 (laughing)

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.680
 - Reasons unknown.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.720
 - So yeah, Skrillex was not on my list

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.520
 of the things that I experienced this week.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.520
 And then last night was Claire Ralsay at a Warhol Museum.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.240
 - Yeah.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.080
 - Fucking astounding.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.400
 But again, another like 180,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.480
 not 180 back into Monster Truck Jam,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.360
 but like 180 into like a different dimension.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.360
 It was like field recordings and ambient textures

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.840
 and like vocal recordings and shit.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.480
 - Lot of auto tune, like scene through auto tune.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.320
 - In a way that wasn't unpleasant,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.040
 like I think I fit the aesthetic

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.800
 and like guitar stuff that didn't,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.960
 that wasn't upsetting.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.120
 And it's like acoustic guitar can be sometimes

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.240
 in that context.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.120
 It was good.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.200
 Sound quality for their sound is exceptional.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.040
 - Absolutely, yeah.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.320
 - It's really good.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.480
 Props to the sound person, you kind of do that.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.320
 - Absolutely.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.040
 I've seen a couple of things there at the Warhol that,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.520
 I mean, sometimes it's not great,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.080
 but when it's on, it's fucking on.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.080
 It's not a bad place to see things.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.920
 Also chairs.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.000
 - Chairs.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.840
 - I'm getting old.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.440
 I appreciate now shows with chairs.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.440
 Comfy chairs too.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.280
 - Yeah, I saw Claire, she tweeted too, saying she played

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.200
 like a soft set because she was like,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.160
 oh, people are sitting down.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.080
 And maybe that wasn't the expectation.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.360
 So I was like, I'm gonna play like my soft set.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.160
 And I don't know, that's out my alley anymore, you know?

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.000
 - Oh, yes.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.600
 - Hearing issues aside, I'm just kind of like,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.360
 what like rounded soft things.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.280
 I'm like feeling, feeling my age a little bit.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.200
 - Funny, I know I was just talking to David about that

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.040
 before you showed up.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.920
 I was like, I want a big comfy couch.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.760
 I was like, I kind of hurt lately.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.080
 And I just want to be fucking comfortable.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.800
 It's like, what's wrong with that?

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.680
 - I can't just sit on a floor anymore, be okay.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.520
 - Yeah.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.800
 - Yeah.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.160
 - Done that a lot.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.560
 - Put in some time.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.960
 - And like slept on like just hardwood floors

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.120
 or concrete floors at the back of a venue

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.480
 or at someone's base.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.880
 - And abandoned bee packing plants.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.720
 - Yeah.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.040
 - And Detroit.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.320
 We've all done our fair share of,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.800
 - And like hopped up the next morning

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.680
 and like, you know, sort of like cracked your back

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.680
 and was like, ugh, I'm gonna feel that.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.600
 And then like, just walk away.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.200
 Where now I'd be like incapacitated.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.080
 I would just be out for that.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.840
 Like, well, I'm done for the weekend boys.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.640
 - Someone get me the car, I'll just lay in the back seat.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.360
 - I used to sleep in your van.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.200
 - Yes.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.920
 - I can't even imagine doing that right now.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.440
 I'd probably be fucked for a couple of days.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.160
 Like, did you sleep on the floor

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.720
 or on the couch that I saw it in half and just--

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.120
 - The blue Muppet couch.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.120
 - Yeah.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.000
 - Slept on both.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.840
 - Yeah.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.960
 It wasn't like a fix to the floor,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.480
 anything it was just a couch thrown in the back of the van.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.720
 And as you would drive, it would just slide around.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.680
 It was, it was awesome, is what it was.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.320
 - It was, I was an RIP that van.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.160
 - Yeah.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.600
 - We went on some adventures in that van.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.320
 - I remember my first time in that van.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.480
 I was like, wow.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.320
 (laughing)

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.760
 - The fuck is going on here.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.720
 - Best $400, I ever spent.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.520
 RIP of that van and RIP are back.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.680
 All those lights.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.640
 (laughing)

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.440
 - And the pink boom box.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.280
 - Oh yeah, that stole.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.640
 - That got stolen in Detroit.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.600
 That had the Randy Macha Man Savage rap CD in it.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.440
 - Yeah.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.280
 - It did.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.000
 They busted open the window of the,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.040
 and that's the only thing they stole.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.440
 So it was like hundreds of dollars to replace the window

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.440
 for a $5 boom box and an even less valued CD that I was like.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.800
 - What are you talking about?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.080
 That CD's priceless, Dave.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.400
 - I mean, rare art effects.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.240
 - I think it is a negative value.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.440
 - Come across it, you actually owe somebody money.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.400
 - But you're a man, Hulk.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.200
 - Oh, I mean, I remember it because it was the only CD

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.640
 we listened to driving from Pittsburgh to Detroit.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.800
 - Five hours.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.640
 - On repeat.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.480
 - Yes.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.080
 - I've had a taste of that venom before.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.360
 (laughing)

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.880
 - You know, now that we're, now we're attaining this out loud,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.720
 it never occurred to me.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.960
 What if someone we were with,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.600
 pretended to break in?

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.160
 - Just to take it hard.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.000
 - Yes.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.240
 (laughing)

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.360
 - I'm starting to suspect.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.720
 - No, they broke right in.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.560
 - That was awesome.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.400
 - Good.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.240
 - Running away.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.080
 - Damn, your boom box is gone.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.040
 They all know and the CD.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.880
 - I can't jump my hand.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.720
 - Bit dull.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.560
 - It's right after.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.720
 - Is that a piece of glass?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.240
 (laughing)

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.800
 - It's weird to didn't take anything else.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.400
 (laughing)

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.160
 - I did not think solving a crime

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.640
 would be on our agenda for this episode.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.880
 - Yeah, where are we going?

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.720
 - Yeah.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.880
 - We were talking about Yo-Yo Ma.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.040
 - Yeah, I was talking about it.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.880
 - Yeah, pretty much.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.880
 - Ooh, man.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.720
 (laughing)

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.560
 - Ooh, man.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.240
 - That checks out.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.080
 - Yeah.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.920
 - That's how we're rolling today, folks.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.520
 We gotta roll with the punches.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.480
 - It's Saturday and a sunny but cold Pittsburgh.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.320
 - Yeah.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.160
 - Yeah.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160
 - So what's on everyone else's list?

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.440
 I mean, I'm only one with a paper list.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.760
 Everyone else is using technology.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.040
 - How about digital lists, you know?

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.640
 - Digital list as well.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.920
 - Yeah, what do I have personally?

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.080
 What did I say last time?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.480
 Wasn't gonna shuffle anything.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.880
 Of course, per standard, shuffle to bunch of shit.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.080
 ER 301 left the mix and that kind of funded

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.660
 the rest of the adventure.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.840
 They did wanna talk about the ER 301 really briefly.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.880
 Like 'cause I had that thing for a number of years.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880
 - Yeah.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.200
 - I guess my end summary with it is like,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.520
 just use a computer.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.680
 And I don't mean that to like,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.440
 it's a really cool object.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.400
 It's awesome.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.040
 A lot of the stuff was just a little,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.840
 a lot harder to do than in Ableton to be honest

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.120
 or with even MaxForLive and up.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.080
 People would liken that thing to like,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.080
 Max MSP in like module.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.400
 And it was nothing near that.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.880
 It was more like Ableton, you know,

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.440
 effect swim lanes with some like modulation

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.160
 and ability to like, you know, affect those things.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.960
 But never had quite the power you would want.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.920
 A lot of limits.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.680
 And for me, it was just like,

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.200
 I used it in like one kind of track

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.200
 that I have in the Q to finish.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.200
 And other than that, like a live set.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.720
 And it just never quite gelled for me.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.760
 As soon as I kind of got rid of it

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.320
 and put some simpler things in space,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.960
 it was like, ah, like it was a,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.760
 the feeling I expected of like kind of a weightlifting.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.320
 Even though when I shipped it to the person,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.720
 I was like, oh, it's like,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.760
 gave all these instructions as though it was like,

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.480
 my daughter going to school or something like that.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.960
 And it likes to be read a bedtime story.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.680
 And if it gets a little gassy, just hit it on the back.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.520
 Yeah.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.400
 I mean, it's definitely a jack of all trades master

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.240
 and non-type thing.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.080
 It has some cool stuff.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.880
 You can do like, you know, six or 10 track,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.520
 like 96 kilohertz recording and shit like that.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.000
 But the latency's still a little high

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.240
 for like drum use for what I'm doing.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.320
 Yeah. And I've just been interested in some like,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.560
 flatter stuff.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.080
 And so accordingly picked up a couple of things

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.160
 and I'll talk about mainly like Cosmex Pro

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.160
 and Sophia from Zalk Chaos Devices,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.440
 both fucking astounding.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.160
 So if I have my drawers,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.240
 I'm dying to know what you think of the Sophia.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.080
 Oh, Sophia?

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.920
 Yeah.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.240
 I've had my eye on that one since it was announced.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.280
 It's like, I was thinking the past couple of days

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.440
 about how to explain it given like there are these, you know,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.920
 it's a single oscillator and you can kind of blend

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.600
 between two different like,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.240
 ways of affecting it.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.480
 Like it has these elements and these ripples

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.640
 and they're kind of like,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.280
 I'll do a terrible job of explaining this.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.120
 You can research some of the technical stuff,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.480
 but I can talk about it as a user of it.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.040
 And what I'm looking for right now is like,

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.040
 really liking analog stuff and the ability

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.200
 to like push it a little kind of like,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.360
 I have this button variable waveform generator,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.360
 I really like that because of the different options it has.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.800
 And the Sophia is one of the coolest,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.040
 like we were saying last night a little,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.440
 I'd love a book that like compiles all the ways

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.040
 you can treat an analog oscillator and the things you can do.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.480
 Cause the sounds it can make are like really interesting

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.320
 in the way that it can like kind of morph an analog waveform.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.000
 You can kind of switch between like fundamentals.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.480
 Like you asked me last night,

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.000
 it looks like Odessa very similarly.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.120
 Couldn't be more different.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.000
 That's like a digital additive thing.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.360
 This is like pure analog and wow,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.160
 it's got like the juice to it.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.000
 Like literal like kind of like squirty,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.800
 almost like a juicy analog like weirdness that happens.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.520
 It's really good at patching itself.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.880
 It's got a number of outputs, like fundamental outputs.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.360
 And then like these kind of ripple outputs,

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.160
 but you can kind of fade between these two types of elements

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.320
 to get these different like alterations

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.760
 of this core analog oscillator.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.240
 Like how are you setting up the thing

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.720
 that you're morphing between?

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.720
 - You're kind of just setting the level

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.800
 to which these warping and damp controls like a back to,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.440
 like those are the sliders you get to like warp and damp.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.000
 I like the way you tune it to.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.440
 You just get like a fine tune and then octave control,

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.280
 which I really love.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.360
 I don't like course tune very much anymore.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.480
 I just want to know where C or whatever it's set to is.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.880
 And then an octave control.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.880
 And you get each of these elements on each side basically.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.600
 You get like a main output.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.800
 And then you kind of get this fundamental output as well.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.600
 And then like an A out and a B out.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.760
 So each side has its own output,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.040
 even though it's coming from the same like core.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.840
 And it's got a global FM control, damp warp,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.400
 and then ratio controls.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.280
 And when you think of ratio, you would think like FM,

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.960
 but it's not quite.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.200
 My understanding is it creates kind of these ripples

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.440
 harmonically within this oscillator core

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.800
 in a way that I've never seen like another thing.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.600
 I don't like straight up wave folding very much.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.680
 Like it's a sound that almost is like

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.960
 nails on chalkboard to me when it's not done subtly.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.800
 And this to me like gives kind of that subtle harmonic change

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.560
 and like the ability to like,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.360
 that like it's a rubbery like squirtiness of the oscillator,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.760
 I think is like really well suited

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.640
 to the kind of techno stuff I'm doing now.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.800
 Like taking in analog oscillator

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.600
 and twisting it harmonically in a way

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.360
 that's like interesting but not super predictable.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.680
 And I also realized I'm have the Pittsburgh flamingo,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.000
 which is a harmonic interpolation, you know, processor,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.120
 if you will, you run a waveform into it

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.600
 and it gives this like center folding.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.080
 It was an old Don Buchl's circuit.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.400
 And I'd always struggled to kind of find a use

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400
 for it musically,

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.480
 maybe because I was running like digital oscillators

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.800
 that were already complex into it.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.840
 But this pairs up with it like perfectly.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.440
 I would like, I would,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.040
 I wish I could just like mash it into the face plate somehow

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.280
 and have those options there

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.520
 'cause I would always probably use them together.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.320
 And it lets you twist like the harmonics a bit more

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.060
 in a way that borders on wave folding,

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.600
 but sounds a little more wet

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.680
 and a little less mechanical on the host.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.120
 And it's just like, I didn't expect,

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.600
 I kind of expected, you know,

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.520
 my friend Luke like recommended to me,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.440
 it was like, oh, you would really like this, you know,

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.360
 this is like crazy.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.640
 And the more samples I heard, I'm like,

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.440
 oh, this is really unique.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.880
 And then got it and just like kind of,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.360
 it's my go to analog oscillator right now.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.640
 Using it for everything,

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.960
 it's just got a really nice sound

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.600
 that isn't too niche.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.040
 It could feel like regular oscillator duties.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.920
 I usually have it in the sign mode though

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.720
 and not like square fundamental

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.960
 'cause I like how that sounds.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.000
 It's just a little smoother.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Really like it, even for the real estate,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.080
 I just think they nailed it.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.760
 I like it even more than Odessa

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.320
 if I would have to pick one of them.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.800
 I think it's the one that's more useful

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.440
 to me musically in a way than Odessa,

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.800
 which is kind of this like really special effect,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.640
 like native instruments,

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.320
 razor type additive thing, which is cool,

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.760
 but not as useful generally.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.440
 I can see like having two cepheas

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.200
 and using it just to have two separate voices musically.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.960
 Very different sound than the analog oscillators I have.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.000
 Not quite classic, not quite modern.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.520
 If you want to bucket it that way,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.240
 it's just really like good sound.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.520
 Definitely recommend it.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.800
 How does it hold up the low end?

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.960
 Very well, that's a good question

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.320
 'cause a lot of that stuff can fall apart in there

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.360
 and I think the low end is kind of where it shines.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.120
 Like Odessa has a little low end,

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.520
 but not like you wouldn't use it for a bass

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.480
 and this I would use for like bass stuff almost constantly,

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.400
 easily.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.360
 It's really good at that and shines at it.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.840
 Yeah, I really liked Odessa for like texture duties.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.600
 Yeah, it's great for that.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.840
 Like really like sci-fi, you know,

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.680
 it's UFO sounds and like really warpy, like pitch shifty,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.040
 for sure.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.680
 So yeah, it's super impressive.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.880
 It's really got me interested,

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.480
 like I've been doing a lot of stuff on the analog side of things

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.040
 whereas I felt like I was focusing on like digital oscillators

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.840
 especially for a long time.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.720
 And it's just like nailing the sound

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.560
 that I'm kind of going for with my stuff right now.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.280
 So I'm super, super happy I got it.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.280
 It's awesome.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.280
 It's awesome.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.280
 It's rad.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.880
 I can talk about something on the flip side of it.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.880
 Oh yeah?

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.600
 Um, similar like how you're saying you're like your folks on digital.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.640
 That's kind of where I've been at for a while now.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.640
 Mm-hmm.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.880
 Just kind of an avoiding analog stuff.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.040
 Not intentionally, just kind of like just hasn't been attracting my years.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.040
 Yeah.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.040
 Um, one of the weirdest things that I've purchased was like last year.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.480
 In episode 35 we were talking about a thing called VIC.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.280
 I don't know if you guys remember.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280
 I do.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280
 So.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.600
 Yeah, I'll do a brief recap I guess, case anyone.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.640
 I don't remember it at all.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.040
 I remember the name.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:34.000
 So VIC was a module that just like popped up out of nowhere by a independent manufacturer

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.120
 called Forge TME or ForgeTime.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:44.560
 It's a wave table based oscillator like purely digital that has some onboard generative and

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.520
 processing functions built in.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.600
 Um, it kind of reminded me of like a piston Honda on acid.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600
 Mm-hmm.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.600
 Like, um, I purchased it on a whim.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.320
 It just like popped up on ModWiggler one day.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.960
 The guy was like, this is my module.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.400
 I've been working on it for two years throughout the pandemic.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.080
 You can order it directly through me and you had some YouTube videos.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.480
 It was a cool post.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.480
 It was.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.480
 It was like really cool.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:21.400
 And like the description of it was the VIC twists, convulses and walls in a vortex-haunted

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.800
 spitting dirt and dust time and raw energy.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:31.320
 Rapid shadows, alien physics, pulsating artifacts, sometimes ridiculous, sometimes

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.320
 possessed.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.040
 I was like, I'm sold.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.280
 Yeah, I'm fucking married.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.600
 The videos are cool.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:44.640
 That description caught my attention and like the sound was like very raw, very experimental.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.960
 And it was just available as you posted it.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960
 You know what I mean?

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.960
 There was no teasing.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.800
 There was no kick starters.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.800
 There was no bullshit.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.720
 It was just, this is the thing that I built.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.720
 You can buy it.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.720
 Um.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720
 I appreciate it.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.280
 I like that sort of no teasing, no hype just as is.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.280
 Yeah.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.280
 I appreciate it a lot.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.960
 At the same time though, it kind of felt sussy.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.960
 Like you know what I mean?

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.760
 It was kind of like, it felt like a risky purchase to me.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.760
 Yeah.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.800
 Because they had no track record, nothing but I took the jump, I purchased it and was

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:20.840
 like immediately having fun building like industrial, you know, textures and soundscapes

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840
 with it.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.040
 So based on that description, did it actually evoke that written description?

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040
 It did.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040
 Okay.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.040
 So it was accurate.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.040
 Yeah.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.040
 Dude knew what he was going for when he built it.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.880
 And he nailed it in my opinion.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.440
 Um, it wasn't perfect.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440
 You know what I mean?

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.240
 Like it was a really cool module, but there was a few ideas that I had that would have

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.240
 made it better.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.400
 And there was only 50 made at the time too.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.400
 So they're like, yeah, it was very few.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.160
 But the people that had it similar to myself, like we were all kind of into it and posting

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.160
 suggestions.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.840
 Did it have a microprocessor that could be updated?

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.280
 It was something that you know, like, oh, these are great ideas.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.000
 And then there's going to be 1.1 firmware and you can get all of your ideas.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.480
 And it will immediately like myself and a few others that had it started coming up

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.680
 with like some feedback and posting it on the ModWiggler thread that he had made.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.040
 Um, and he was like very receptive to it.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.000
 Um, and he said like, you know, he did a short bash of these, but he was already coming

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.320
 up with his own ideas for like a future version.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.320
 Okay.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:26.160
 Nobody knew if this would be an update or hardware vision or what or like an expansion.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.240
 Like we were talking about maybe doing an expander at some point that would add like

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.360
 CV over the generative functions and things like that.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:38.280
 So he was like paying attention to everyone's feedback and asking for more.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:46.240
 And now as of like a week ago, he mentioned that he's about to release the second version,

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.000
 which he's just calling V-HIC X.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.160
 Is it new hardware or is it an all new hardware and entirely different new module?

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.920
 Um, yeah, it seems to take it to the next level.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.520
 He's also going to be producing a lot more than just 50 this time around.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.440
 Um, he said he has received interest from about 200 different people and he says he

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:11.120
 has the components to try to do around three to 400.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:17.000
 Um, and he's going to be doing them in batches of like 50 to 100 at a time.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.400
 Um, the first 25, suppose it'll be released this month, but it's just going to be the

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.200
 local buyers in Australia.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.160
 Mm, it's going to be like the pilot run to see if, you know, it's functional and all

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.160
 that.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.920
 And then if it's working fine, he's going to open it up to international sales.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:42.120
 Um, the new version features 24 bit input output stereo processing, which is cool because

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.520
 I love wave table based processing and maggling.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.080
 Um, yeah, that's, that's the big one for me.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.080
 He also says that there will be some banks dedicated just for processing this time around.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.320
 Um, there will be CV control over everything now, including the generative functions.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320
 Oh, nice.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.000
 Uh, which have also undergone some improvements, whereas instead of just like flipping to random

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.240
 modes, you'll be able to scan through these like generative algorithms that he has in

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.640
 there that just kind of shifts and morphs it.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.400
 Um, 27 new modes altogether.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:24.200
 Uh, volume control for the input output levels, a dedicated VCA with a CV control in the output.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:31.000
 Um, it'll save current parameters when you power it off and price tag their aim and for

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.640
 525 USD.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:39.400
 So kind of steep for complex oscillator, but I kind of view it more as just an oscillator

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:46.760
 means more like a oscillator slash processor slash just drone texture machine kind of self

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.760
 contained.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.520
 That's why it appealed to me in the first place.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.600
 Um, which was the, the first version.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.600
 I forget.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.600
 I want to say like 350.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.600
 Okay.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.600
 Could be wrong.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.840
 Is it like same size, like bigger 24 HP.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.560
 So bigger, um, chunk bigger.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.680
 Um, so the screen now, I didn't have a screen before.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.680
 Did it?

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680
 I didn't before.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.920
 I don't remember if it does now.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.240
 He did send a picture in the email.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.800
 I forget if it had a little screen or not.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800
 I don't think it does.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.040
 I think there's no menu diving.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.040
 That's for sure.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:23.920
 It's all like upfront, you know, all parameters are mapped to knob, basically or a switch.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.520
 So this, this sounds like chaos.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.840
 How do you intend to use it?

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.520
 What's your, what's your plan for it?

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.520
 Chaos.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.520
 Okay.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:36.800
 Like industrial, uh, soundscapes basically, um, and hopefully live performance.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:43.080
 Cause I, while like what it does isn't anything new to me, you know what I mean?

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.040
 It kind of reminds me of like patches that I used to create using like two piss and Hondas

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.880
 and like a rain maker, you know what I mean?

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.280
 Or like just wave table based oscillators through delays and shit like that.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.880
 And I would use to make, um, just strange like textures and soundscapes live.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.800
 Like last time I performed, I was doing just that.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.320
 I had, um, I think it was a piston at the time and I was running it through a rain maker

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.320
 and stuff like that.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:12.360
 And I was using it to make pseudo generative like textures, you know, like evolving over

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:16.040
 time and randomizing when I would hit certain parameters and shit and I had some presets

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.040
 saved.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:23.600
 Um, so this kind of feels like, uh, a shortcut for me to achieve that type of industrial,

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.880
 you know, dirty raw sound, uh, in a self contained module.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.840
 It's chaos, but do, can you tighten it up and get control and get it to sort of repeat

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.280
 sounds over and over again?

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.280
 Yeah, you can.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.920
 Um, but you also don't at the same time.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.360
 Like the, the switches when you hit them, like it would shift things algorithmically.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.360
 You didn't have any control of what it was doing exactly.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.800
 And that was kind of the appeal for me.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.800
 Yeah.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.800
 You know what I mean?

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.560
 It was just kind of like, you know, just fucking around until you found something you

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.400
 enjoyed, you know, and then you can expand it from there.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:02.680
 Um, I like that type of approach, um, especially in a life performance mode, you know what

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.440
 I mean, to improvise on the spot and try to come up with something that I like.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.960
 But if our listeners are listening to this, it, it sounds like it's always this untamed

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.960
 beast.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.100
 Like, you know, the, the only thing that's a little untamable that you don't have any

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:23.080
 control over is like the, if you're hitting those algorithms, you know what I mean?

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.080
 Okay.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.080
 To shift.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.080
 Yes.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.040
 If you get a sound you like you can actually, oh, I'm just going to keep using this.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.040
 Mm hmm.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040
 Oh, okay.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:36.600
 Like different modes and then when you hit the, the seed button, it would, you know, change

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.600
 accordingly depending on like what mode you were in.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.600
 Gotcha.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.600
 Okay.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.360
 And you know, the parameters are always still locked to those, uh, the same functions that

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.360
 they do.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.920
 So like, you know, you just kind of rain it in that way, but at the same time there was

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.720
 always, uh, potential to just get a new sound out of it.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:57.640
 You know, yeah, that was like not entirely intentional, uh, which I liked.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.800
 So yeah, hopefully that will be out soon.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.640
 I plan on getting one as soon as I can.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.120
 Um, you're going to keep the original one that you have or is it, I already sold it to

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.120
 make room for this one.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.680
 That answer that question.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.680
 Yeah.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.680
 Like I wanted to make sure that I could get this as soon as I can.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:20.160
 And he's, he made a few other, um, I guess just version one.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.440
 He made like a handful more that he's selling, I guess to help make funds for this.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.640
 So, but it was still like super limited.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.240
 Are you, are you and everyone else who provided, uh, like feedback and like shout outs in the,

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.240
 uh, manual?

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:36.240
 I don't think so, but I think we can all pat ourselves in the back for having like a hand

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.880
 in taking this to the next level, you know what I mean?

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:44.480
 There's a Greg knob and it's more or less Greg new and some of the suggestions I had

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.400
 people already made anyways in the thread.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.640
 So like I was just kind of like nodding in agreement as I was reading this stuff over

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.640
 time.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.960
 I was like, yeah, yeah, but yeah, I'm excited for it.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:59.240
 It's probably the only oscillator around the horizon for me that I'm excited about.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.160
 And it was the version one was the last one I bought that really had me excited to.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:08.280
 So it's been a year where I haven't really dove too much into new oscillators.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.160
 So the first one was only a year ago.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.680
 Yeah, probably not even.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.160
 That's a pretty quick turnaround to version two.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.160
 Yeah.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160
 Mm.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.720
 He's been, uh, he's been at it since like he released it.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.200
 Like people started giving feedback and he was like, yeah, I hear you.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.200
 And this is only their second model module they haven't done anything else in the interim

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.120
 thing else in between.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.120
 There was pictures in the videos when this came out originally of like some other stuff

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.640
 that didn't, you know, that was in his rack.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.960
 That was clearly stuff that he made.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.760
 It had the same type of like faceplates and stuff.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:43.160
 So I'm guessing he's working on some other stuff, but this is like, I guess his, his

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.360
 opus that he's focused on.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.360
 Nice.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.360
 Yeah.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.360
 Digital chaos.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.360
 Yippee.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.360
 Yeah.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.520
 That's actually one of the things that I have to talk about.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.920
 I feel like we talked about it indirectly at one point.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.280
 Uh, I got a noise plethora from Befaco.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.120
 Oh, yeah, you did.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.880
 Um, it's the actual hardware.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.520
 I got some noise.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.520
 Yeah.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.520
 Yes.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.520
 It is a database of noise.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:13.400
 And I think my initial when we first popped up, I was like, oh, this doesn't seem like

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.120
 anything I need, you know, like I have ways to make noise.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.440
 And then I remember you kind of, uh, kind of brushed it aside.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.440
 I did brush it a little aside.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.240
 I said, I already have noise sources.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.360
 I don't fucking need this trash.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.240
 I, you know what?

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.240
 I don't remember correctly.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.560
 So that would make this garbage ass module.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.560
 Yeah.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.560
 You spit on the print out of it.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.560
 Yeah.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.200
 I think you use it for toilet paper at one point.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.560
 So my memory is really bad.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.560
 So all of this could be true.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.280
 I will believe everything you're saying.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.880
 I remember being lukewarm towards it though.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:49.320
 And then I saw some more demos and then was doing this sort of like, I need, I need a,

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:55.720
 I do need a better sort of consolidated noise source and looked around and landed on this.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:01.960
 And basically had to take back everything I had said, um, months and or a year ago.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.320
 Uh, it's fucking amazing.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.320
 Yeah.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.320
 I love it.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.320
 Yeah.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:14.280
 It is, it is the noise texture toolkit Swiss army knife as a noise source as a modulation

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.280
 noise source.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.280
 It's perfect.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.420
 As just using noise that you want, you know, if you need to make snare sounds or hi hats

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:25.560
 or any of those sort of like percussive sounds with noise, you have an amazing amount of

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.840
 control over shaping that.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:33.760
 Or if you just want to make an something and for a noise set, you could do an entire

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:39.640
 noise set just from this module and a shit little modulation sources total flip on it.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.600
 And, um, so it's two generators.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.320
 Well, three generators, but the A and B generators are the same.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.680
 You choose, uh, there's three banks.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.600
 The banks are textures.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.320
 Um, it's just a lot of FM shit.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.120
 Um, HH clusters, which initially I thought was high hat clusters.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:02.960
 And then I was like, Oh wait, no, it means like, like high, high cluster, like math clustering.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.960
 Yeah.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.560
 Um, it was high hat cluster too.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.560
 Yeah.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.920
 It's, and it's a lot of like detuned and like this, like the spreading and indexing is like

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.480
 the, the parameters you have, um, for it, or maybe I'm wrong, maybe it is high hat clusters.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.320
 But the more I thought about it, I was like, this seems really math heavy.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:22.280
 It's probably the high, high cluster in clustering algorithms.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.200
 What if I had just a mathematical construct that exists in the universe?

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.600
 Let's shut it down.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:33.480
 We're going to get rated because that's like either by the FBI, the CIA, or the Illuminati.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.040
 Like that is not, that was not supposed to be spoken.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:36.560
 I'm sorry.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.880
 Wow.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.600
 I've been playing with the VCV or act version of it.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.120
 Yeah.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.680
 And enjoying it quite a bit.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.440
 I'm curious to see how it differs from the hardware.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.280
 I would be too.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.000
 Sounds any different.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.400
 I, I, the sonic, Oh, and I'm sorry.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.560
 And the last one is this, the C bank is just harsh, wild noise.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:55.920
 Mm hmm.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.400
 Chaos shed, um, like a sample or something like that.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:31:59.960
 Or how does that?

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.200
 So the whole thing is digital.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:01.560
 Right.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.280
 Um, it's different.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.440
 It's a thing.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.040
 Yeah.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:04.480
 Yeah.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.320
 And then I think there's 10 algorithms in each of the banks.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:16.440
 Um, and then they have, depending on what you've chosen, it's either like, sign waves that have these different sort of relationships with one another.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:21.520
 And you've got two parameters that can modulate, either modulate them with F.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.560
 M or change our pitch or change the index on them.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:32.880
 Um, and then the harsh noise stuff is, you know, it's white noise or like, you know, a couple of like crazy, weird algorithms.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.720
 And then this changes to the parameters.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:42.120
 Um, what's, and then there's a third generator at the bottom that sits there and it's just a white noise and what's something called grit.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:46.400
 And there's a grit amount and there's three outputs for that one.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:52.280
 White noise just as is grit as is and then a filtered output.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.280
 It's the two of them filtered.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:33:02.160
 And each of the fill and all, all three of the outputs have these analog filters, even though it's entirely digital, it's analog filters.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.600
 And then all three in there, they've got a little switch for modes.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.600
 I pass low pass and bad pass.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.520
 This is like, that's cool.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:15.120
 Yeah, I was like shocked by how much shit they crammed into it.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.680
 Now there is one weird thing.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.040
 When I first was like, oh, I'm going to get this.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.280
 Like, oh, it's a kid.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.360
 I'm going to get the kid.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:22.720
 Yeah.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.680
 I'll make that.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:30.080
 I ended up getting a completed one from Perfect Circuit because it was only going to be like 15 more dollars.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.760
 It was wildly expensive kit.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.800
 The only place that had it was Thonk.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:45.680
 So I would have had to like get it shipped and when everything was done, I was like, it was going to be, like I said, about $15 less than just getting it from Perfect Circuit already done.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.080
 And it was, it looked like it was a bit of a monster build.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.360
 Lots of parts.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.880
 But yeah, no, it's fantastic.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:34:00.320
 And even just doing something as simple as the once you pick a bank, there's a CV input for the program, like, which, which, which,

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.280
 which are those 10 algorithms you have for that bank, that's CVable.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:09.880
 So just firing CV into that just changes in morphs that over time.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:18.400
 Super responsive to CV, even like taking noise out from the third generator and using that as a to change the program.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.640
 Yeah, it's good for self-patching.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:27.760
 I honestly wasn't going to talk about it much because it's kind of been my secret rhythmic noise weapon for the last couple months.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.360
 Blowing up your spot.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.320
 I am sorry for blowing it up because it is.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.560
 Yeah, the self-patching of this thing is just.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.600
 Fucking amazing.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.640
 Yeah, I absolutely absolutely love this thing.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.280
 Like, I feel bad for how Luke Warm I was to it.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.560
 Yeah, I mean, your Luke warm attitude towards it made me kind of disregarded for a while too.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.520
 And then like, I just happened to see that it was available for VCP.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:56.760
 And I was like, guys, this is that thing that Dave, you know, shook off, gafaud at.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.320
 Stuck his nose.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.120
 Stuck his nose.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:34:59.640
 Yeah.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.680
 I was like, oh, we try this and like playing around with it for a while.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:08.480
 I was like, mmm, I see a lot of like rhythmic noise potential here that I did not anticipate.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.760
 I was like, this thing's pretty cool.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:15.960
 Yeah, there's maybe two algorithms out of the entire set of 30 that I'd say.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.840
 Are like, OK and not great.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.840
 Each of them have two arguments.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.760
 There's an X and a Y.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.640
 They call it and they're different.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.920
 Their context sensitive based on what algorithm you pick, those are CVable.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:33.160
 The cutoff for the filter each of each filter has our own cutoff CV.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.240
 The grit amount has a CV.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:44.480
 It's yeah, it's really shockingly full featured and like you can just shape stuff in this

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.480
 amazing way, like two enthusiastic thumbs up.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.080
 And again, Greg, I'm sorry.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.640
 I've a ruined your secret sauce there.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.200
 Secret weapon, man.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.920
 Yeah, I've been using a lot in the recordings of and doing lately.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.040
 We'll throw them all out, man.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:58.920
 That's it. Yeah.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.200
 Now it's a now it's gonna be trendy.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.200
 Exactly.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.800
 Cause that's how we throw it all away.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.120
 That's what our recordings do.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.040
 This episode set trends.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.760
 So what happens when you're an influencer, Dave?

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.920
 Are we influencers or are we synth flu inserts?

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.800
 Jesus Christ.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:21.240
 I edit that the fuck up up until recently, dude.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.480
 I didn't even know that synth fluencer was a term.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.800
 Yeah.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.960
 Or a synth tuber.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.320
 Oh, I've seen both getting tossed around lately.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.760
 We didn't get from that red means recording shit.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:41.360
 That's since tuber and synth fluencer, for some reason, it just like brings to mind an image

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.640
 of like some bro dude on a ski slope

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:50.840
 and like a neon pink outfit chugging a red bull.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.280
 Hey, bro.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.760
 I'm a synth tuber.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.040
 Smash that subscribe button.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.520
 Smash that bell.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.040
 I'm gonna like and subscribe.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.320
 She's gonna go rolling to IRA energy drink or something like that.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:11.320
 Can't wait to peep the new electron digs, bro.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:15.000
 I hate it.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.680
 It's like the worst term ever.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.600
 I thought influencers sucked, but yeah.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.400
 Synth fluencer or fucking synth tuber is.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.760
 Yeah, that feels gross.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:29.360
 Synth tube is just there's something unsettling about like those two words beside each other.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.080
 I don't like that at all.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.240
 So I feel like that was on your list of things to discuss.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.480
 Oh, bitching about red means recording.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.440
 OK, that's what that was.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.960
 Can I rant?

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.040
 Please, I would love to rant a little bit about it.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.240
 It's been bothering me for weeks, to be honest.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.920
 Like do you think we're going to hold you back?

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.480
 Maybe.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.160
 No, there's no, there's no like the gates open.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:57.400
 But what if ranting about other synth fluencers,

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.920
 ruins our prospect of becoming big since Fluencers, Dave?

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.560
 Everyone's banding together.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:09.560
 They're unionizing to fight against the big music gear corporations, Dave.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.360
 Get what's fair for them.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.280
 Don't we want to ride that train to get what we deserve?

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.200
 I like that both of us have trouble saying synth fluencers.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.360
 Yeah, it does not roll off the tongue.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.840
 And all.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.040
 Nick, can you say synth fluencer?

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.240
 Do you say the fluencer?

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.360
 Oh, yeah, when you do it quicker, it's hard.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.880
 Yeah, it's a hard word.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.160
 It's it's it's it's a winter.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.000
 It's wildly inorganic.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.880
 So go ahead, Greg.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.200
 The floor is yours.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:46.880
 Again, it's bringing like an image of like the cheesiest used car sales lot that you can imagine.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.840
 You know, but instead of like cars, it's just like gear.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.640
 Yeah, like you got the electron corner over there.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.600
 And this dude's in like a fucking popped collar dress shirt.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.640
 Hey, bro, what do I got to do to get you in this new octet track today?

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:09.240
 So I'm going to go talk to my manager and I'm going to see what kind of sweet discount, bro.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.280
 I'll throw in a free MIDI cable.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.520
 I just got hired as the resident synth fluencer at Sweetwater.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.160
 Do I just speak something terrible into existence?

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.880
 This is twice now.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.960
 Say that tonight.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.000
 You have you have caused cosmic damage.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.160
 That's what happens when you stay up to like six.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:36.680
 But yeah, it's I'm I'm assuming that most people that listen to us have only had some

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:41.080
 exposure to the latest Red Means recording video.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.640
 Like because even big like music gear blogs have been talking about it.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.960
 And for the most part, shitting on it.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.320
 And I think rightfully so.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:56.640
 So in case they haven't, is there a sort of like a bumper sticker or executive elevator pitch?

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.400
 Yes, Jeremy from Red Means recording has

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:08.000
 main character syndrome and like real bad and thinks that like the whole industry

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.240
 should revolve around what he considers a fair wage.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.920
 Because he sold his soul to be a fucking gear

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.720
 shill and now feels like a cheap dirty whore.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:24.680
 And doesn't think that his value has been met.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.400
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.240
 It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.800
 And this came out in the form of a very

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:37.600
 a big video where he goes back and forth between cuts of him arguing his own points.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.200
 Yes.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:38.680
 Yeah.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:44.600
 In case we're too dumb to understand it or to come up with our own interpretations of what he's saying,

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:52.000
 he interprets it for us and lets us know why he feels he should be paid more to do what he does.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:04.680
 Which is film a 10 minute long video of him wanking on a drum machine or a new sense and thinks that he should be getting enough money to pay his

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.680
 mortgage, his words for doing this.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:13.960
 Yeah, it was a strange video and like I watched it and I was like, that was weird.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.000
 And then I tried to let it go.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:28.440
 But then like over the course of the week following the video, I saw it like being referenced everywhere, like in my Facebook feed, in my music gear blog feeds, like all that shit, like people.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.120
 Yeah, it became I almost missed it at first.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.560
 And yeah, what a little fire winner.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.720
 Like, yeah, it's in like right after you mentioned it.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.000
 Yeah.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.120
 Like, oh, I'm going to like see what the deal is here.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.600
 One bit viral and not really in a good way.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:45.120
 Like, I think in his mind, he imagined everyone like rallying behind him.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:45.840
 Yeah.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:42:00.760
 And I watched, I watched the video and what I was getting was a little bit of like the normal ray, like standing up and like shutting down the factory and there's going to be this workers revolt revolution and we were going to change the industry.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.640
 And like that's what I've and maybe I'm misinterpreting like what his intent was.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.800
 I mean, some of the stuff he was saying like made sense, like it started out.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.200
 OK, like one of the first things I took a note of.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.760
 He says, gear is fleeting.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.000
 It's creativity and time and passion that matters more than anything else.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.240
 And I was like, cool.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:22.720
 Yeah.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.600
 I'm following you.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.240
 I'll keep watching this video.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:25.440
 No.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:46.920
 But then like he goes back and forth talking about like how the industry needs to change because big manufacturers are taking advantage of him and people like him by paying him with heavily discounted gear or free gear that he can either keep or sell and then have the money for.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.800
 He says that that's not enough.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:54.160
 And he uses an example as a $500 drum machine is what he kept saying.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.360
 First off, I don't know what drum machine he's getting for $500.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.240
 Right.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:03.040
 But I know a lot of people that would gladly take that and say, thank you.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:12.120
 But he goes, I'm going to get this drum machine and I'm going to learn it and I'm going to make a video showing it off and making music with it.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:17.960
 And then if I don't say anything completely negative about it, other people will go and buy this drum machine.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.920
 So I'm left with this drum machine and I don't need a drum machine.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.280
 I can't pay my mortgage with a drum machine.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.520
 I can't feed my dog with a drum machine.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:31.520
 So to be fair, that is a fair point.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.480
 I mean, there's an economy here that we're talking about.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:41.240
 Is the value that he created with the work that he did worth more than that $500 machine?

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:41.680
 No.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.920
 That is the I think that's the fundamental flop.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.360
 All of this is dude, you're just it's an ad.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.240
 You made an ad.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.000
 You made a slick ad.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:44:04.360
 You're also like it's almost like you're complaining about your ability to negotiate to this industry that you created yourself in a sense that nobody like putting the entire industry on blast.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:13.200
 Yeah, because your negotiation tactics or you literally feel like you're not getting paid enough after selling your soul to these companies that chill for them.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.720
 But don't do it.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.440
 Yeah, it's meant to be a hobby.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.000
 Or pivot into other business opportunities.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.080
 I mean, make a patreon page.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:22.880
 He has one.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.760
 But like there's other people that are in the same spot.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:32.040
 And in fact, arguably a lot of people are not just with synthesizers, but other people that are doing this type of work.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.960
 There's a hustle and I'm not at quote work.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:36.600
 Right.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.480
 But I'm not and I'm certainly not advocating for hustle culture.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:39.960
 Yeah.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:46.680
 But there are people that are like, OK, now I've got, you know, 10,000 viewers or I've got X number of viewers.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.840
 I'm going to parlay that into ad sales or these other things.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.600
 Like, yeah, if you want to do this for a living, you need to figure out what that next step is.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.400
 It can't be doing, which seems disingenuous because he doesn't bring that up.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.640
 He's not talking about the ad revenue that he's getting.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.880
 He's not talking about the patreon money that he's getting.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:08.880
 And if he is doing those things, then he is making his mortgage and is feeding his dog.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:14.720
 Even if he isn't like to be a synth fluencer, one would assume that you're doing it

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.520
 because you love gear, right?

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.000
 You have some spare time.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.080
 You want to make a fucking video about a piece of gear that appeals to you.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.360
 If you're not doing it for that reason, then why the fuck are you doing it?

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:27.840
 Right.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:34.480
 Like to he seems like maybe that's how he started, but he seems to have lost his way.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.000
 And now he's angry because he's spending time making videos about shit.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 He doesn't really want or care about, right?

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.240
 And he expects it to pay his bills.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:46.880
 It's not that the similar from other people that like I know that have gotten into

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:51.880
 making music as a living and then found out that making music for a living

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.880
 isn't that great.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.720
 Yeah, it's actually a really difficult thing.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:56.920
 You have to make music.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.400
 You don't like anymore or you want to do something different, but you can't because

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.400
 you've built a brand or the label wants you to do these other things.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:08.760
 Like this is not a dissimilar problem with other people that take a passion

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.240
 and try to make a career out of it.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:10.600
 Right.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:15.240
 But at least with that, there's still some art involved, even if you're making shitty

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.280
 pop music, there's some art involved.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.960
 There's no fucking art and being a

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.360
 Yeah.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.160
 Blowing down.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:21.920
 Like, come on.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:26.080
 Like he added a couple colored LED lights to his videos.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.480
 And he was talking like, oh, I had to do this to step up my game.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.280
 Cause there's a lot of competition out there.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.000
 Like, bro, no one gives a fuck if you have an LED light in your video or not.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.160
 No one cares.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.240
 And compare that to like a Richard Divine Instagram video where there's fucking

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.680
 colored lights everywhere.

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.960
 And those are like captivating.

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.280
 If you're going to do that, go all in.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.960
 Make a fucking crazy video.

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:53.200
 Like, like if you take what you did with an LED strip and compare it to what

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.560
 Richard Divine did or some of these other people that are just putting them on Instagram,

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.320
 you fell flat, man.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.160
 Like you didn't.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.640
 And again, people like Richard Divine, like he's doing that as a side gig.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.440
 Yeah.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.720
 That's not his main gig.

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:09.160
 That's not his career is making leap-flop videos on YouTube.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.640
 Like that's side gig.

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:15.880
 His main gig is being a sound designer, being an artist, you know, like.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.800
 But his videos, there's some of the best videos when it comes to like

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:25.160
 showcasing some of the scare because he puts a lot of thought and creativity

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.400
 and care into those videos.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.320
 And that just pops off the off the screen.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:30.520
 Yeah.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.560
 And he's not trying to fashion them into something to, you know, market himself.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.480
 Or to add to his career, he's just kind of it is what he wants to do.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:38.640
 Yeah.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.840
 He does not have to do it.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.640
 Like I'm sure in some way there's a promotional benefit.

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.480
 But at this point, he's the number one sound designer in the world has been for a long time.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.040
 Yeah.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.040
 I don't think there's nothing nowhere to go.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.320
 I don't understand at what point he decided like this should be a career.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.440
 You know what I mean?

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:53.840
 Yeah.

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.120
 And he feels cheated on it.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.640
 Like I'm no career counselor or anything.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:58.960
 Right.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.200
 Right.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.800
 But like if I was.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.240
 And some like ambitious kid.

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.520
 Came into my office in high school and was like, Mr. Vanek, I want to be a

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.200
 Sinfluencer when I grow up.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.200
 I'd say it's good to have dreams, kiddo.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:19.120
 But let's like focus on something a little more realistic.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.000
 We need to get those math grades up because you are not going to be able to do that.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.920
 Like why don't you be a fucking astronaut?

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:27.280
 Because that would make more logical fucking sense as a career.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:27.600
 Yeah.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.480
 Than trying to fucking pay your mortgage as a Sinfluencer.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:30.720
 Yeah.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.200
 Yeah.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.560
 This is true.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:39.120
 I mean we should at this point though, devolve that we are making six and seven figures each

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:39.520
 of us.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:39.920
 Oh yeah.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.640
 By doing that.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.640
 So like we're paid by Roland.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:42.880
 Right.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.400
 We're talking about somebody else.

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.480
 Like a lot of three of us are we are absolutely rolling.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.520
 We're actually just mad because we have a choke hold on this cabal

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.800
 of you know, Sinfluencing.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.680
 And we don't want people like Redmiin is recording getting in on the good.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.440
 That's the third secret this probably.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.200
 I'm saying, Jesus Christ.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:07.440
 So the subtitle, the tagline for this is a episode I already forgot the number

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.960
 colon secrets.

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.360
 Yeah.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.960
 Sinfluencer Illuminati.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.960
 I don't, I can't wrap my head around like why he feels like he should get paid more

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.640
 when you're doing something that's like literally a hobby.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.200
 And he even mentions there's a ton of competition.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:21.360
 Yeah.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.280
 There's a ton of other people doing this.

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:28.400
 Like if he doesn't want the five hundred dollar drum machine, or if that's not enough,

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.720
 there's plenty of people behind him that will gladly take it and make a video about it.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:32.960
 Right.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:38.080
 And they'll probably do it with some passion and an unbiased opinion here and there too,

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.400
 which clearly you can't trust him for at this point.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.120
 He's he's proven that he has sold his integrity.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:45.680
 Right.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:50.400
 There was a few comments I saw that people were leaving on his video that just like resonated with me to most.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.120
 This one for example says,

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:57.920
 aren't most small manufacturers actually the ones getting taken advantage of by hundreds of

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.680
 wannabe YouTubers demanding free shit?

00:49:59.680 --> 00:49:59.840
 Yeah.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.520
 Oh, that's fine.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.000
 Yeah.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.760
 That is, that's a really good point.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.560
 I was like, I agree with that one.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:04.720
 Yeah.

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.240
 And I saw another one that I liked.

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.360
 This person said, I prefer unbiased reviews.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.800
 Once you get paid by a company, you no longer are unbiased.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.920
 And besides the perks these influencers quote unquote are getting is of course clicks.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:22.160
 They also get ample access to free software and hardware.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.760
 I sometimes feel us viewers are getting taken advantage of via the skewed

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.240
 messaging.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.080
 We have talked about that on this show.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.960
 We have because we were literally just talking about that last episode.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:42.080
 It's so hard to find somebody just sitting down and having an honest interaction with a piece of gear and going,

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.840
 here's what I liked and here's what I didn't like.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:44.320
 Yes.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.920
 The second you get that vibe of like, you're getting something out of it.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.880
 Even when they go to like, here's the part that didn't like,

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:56.160
 is it or are you just saying that because you know you have to have a thing you didn't like.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:56.560
 Right.

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.440
 And you're kind of phoneing.

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.640
 It's like the self review assessment.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.960
 Like, what can you work on this year?

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.600
 Well, I have to find something to nitpick.

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.200
 I can be a bit of a perfectionist.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.240
 Yes, exactly.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:12.800
 They're just they're just phoning that negative in in order to like, appear unbiased.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.680
 That the comment that I just said, while that much was good,

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.680
 there was a second part to that I forgot to say to.

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:23.360
 He says, what he fails to account for while playing an exploited victim by the music industry

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.800
 is that he also takes in Patreon money and ad revenue from YouTube.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.440
 And yeah, yeah, you know, yeah.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:32.640
 So like, if you're going to do this, that's the hustle.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:39.200
 Getting the Patreon, getting the ad revenue, merch, get a fucking T public site and sell T-shirts.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.480
 Like, do the hustle that a music band would have to do.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:42.800
 Right.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:43.280
 Yeah.

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:43.840
 That's the thing.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:51.040
 He's trying to like, word it like his character, aka his brand,

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.840
 is worth more than others.

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.280
 But it's like, is it though?

00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:00.560
 Like, you don't have like, I don't know him from anything else other than some mediocre

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.360
 YouTube videos.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:02.720
 Like, he's not an artist.

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.400
 I've never listened to his music.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.080
 I don't know him for sound design.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:11.440
 I don't think he has had a following leading up to him being a synth fluencer.

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.160
 So it's like, okay, you don't have a brand.

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:18.640
 You're trying to force yourself as a character upon people.

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:23.600
 And that's the problem.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:28.720
 Probably a little more subjective, but honestly, of the people that are doing this as influencers,

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:32.240
 he's got the lowest charisma, the lowest personality.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:32.560
 Yes.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.520
 Compared to Ben Jordan, compared to even Ricki Tender.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.160
 And you're long.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:36.720
 Yeah.

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:42.480
 The people out there that for better or worse, and I'm not advocating you go and check them out,

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.160
 but like, if you're going to be like, hey, listen, I'm a character.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.360
 Yeah, where you're...

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.360
 You're getting a little creative with your videos.

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.640
 Yeah, really fucking boring, dude.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.320
 Turning on a couple LED lights is not getting creative.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:54.720
 Kuku.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.080
 Yeah.

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:59.280
 Kuku, none of us here want to talk about Kuku.

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.240
 You're going to trigger me, Dave.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:05.680
 But like, if you were going to be an internet character, that is a fucking character.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.000
 Right.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.960
 I can see people being like, yeah, gravitated to that weirdo.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.440
 Yeah.

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.200
 No one's like, oh, Red means recording.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.400
 I want to have a drink with that guy.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.520
 What?

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.800
 I've always found him kind of cringey.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:20.320
 And his latest video was just like, so like, weird and off-putting to me that I don't think

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.560
 I'll ever watch his overview videos again.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.680
 I had to mute the Twitter.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.560
 It's that like, it's just, it's a rough one.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.960
 Yeah, I'm not trying to just shit on him.

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.240
 He's not alone here.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.440
 There are people that are getting behind him on this.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.760
 Some of them like, I jotted down the names.

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.520
 Heinbach is supporting him telling him this video is very important.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.680
 Bo beats or something.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.720
 I can't remember his name.

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.640
 Is that his name?

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.040
 Yeah.

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.960
 Is that just like, hit after hit in my life?

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.280
 Yeah.

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:51.760
 Yeah.

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.400
 I don't know.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.400
 The people that I don't watch, right?

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:54.400
 Right.

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:54.400
 Right.

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:54.880
 Yeah.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:59.520
 But yeah, I mean, it was like you're saying, there's a reason why

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:04.640
 I stick to just a couple people when I go for YouTube synth videos.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.400
 It's a div kid for the most part.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.080
 Blush response.

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:08.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.280
 Joey Blush.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.680
 Like he, I got a shirt on.

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:12.240
 Shot off.

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.520
 I'm wearing a blush response shirt, but full disclosure,

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.720
 this is my fancy shirt.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.080
 I wore this to the symphony.

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:21.920
 Because I was like, oh shit, I don't have like a collage.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.760
 I've, I'm a dirt bag.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:23.920
 Yeah.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.840
 Like I only have t-shirts.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.640
 I chose and wore this because it's my newest shirt.

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:29.280
 Nice.

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.040
 And therefore it was the nicest shirt.

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.720
 I don't know your blush response fan dude.

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.400
 I got this when I ordered a bunch of tapes and records from him.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.160
 I threw a shirt and I, yeah.

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.840
 And his videos are astounding.

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.480
 They're a blast.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.280
 He's having fun.

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.240
 Yeah, he's having fun.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:42.240
 Yeah.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:42.800
 Exactly.

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:46.320
 Like I don't watch this stuff for like technical overviews necessarily.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.880
 I go to div kid for stuff like that or lupop.

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:52.880
 But like, Joey's just getting gear that he thinks is interesting.

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.000
 And he's having a fucking phone with it.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.360
 And he's using it in a weird non-conventional noisy way generally.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.480
 And I'm like, yay.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.440
 And he has that response every once in a while where he's excited about the sound.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.960
 He just giggles like a mad man.

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.440
 Yeah.

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.720
 Like that's worth it.

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.880
 Every time I'm just like, oh dude, I know that feeling.

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.080
 That's what we're all chasing.

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:08.720
 Right.

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.480
 Is he shilling for these companies?

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.040
 Maybe.

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.480
 But he's having fun with it.

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.080
 And he's not demanding more.

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:17.360
 And he's not trying to take advantage of his viewers.

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:17.520
 Right.

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.680
 Which is what annoys me the most about this.

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.760
 Like, I don't know.

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.040
 No, I like that it's his opinion.

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.920
 I try even like my so fear review on one hand where I think like,

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.600
 oh, it's a bad review technically.

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.520
 But it's like, we could start another podcast where we read manuals back to people too.

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.000
 But I'd rather hear like how somebody's using something.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.480
 Right.

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.600
 That helps me get a better understanding of how I might like get lost.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:42.560
 I think we've said from the start that we wouldn't get too technically over-viewy

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.160
 with our shit that we talk about here.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:46.000
 Because manuals exist.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:46.560
 Exactly.

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.680
 You don't need me to read it.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.320
 You know what I mean?

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:52.480
 I think people listen to us because it would rather hear our hot takes on whether or not

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.840
 we like something and why.

00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:57.840
 And not just reading a manual into a microphone necessarily.

00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:58.400
 Right.

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.400
 So yeah, I don't know.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.480
 It just kind of irked me a bit.

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:02.800
 Yeah.

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:03.440
 You know what I mean?

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:06.880
 It's like, we do this because we like doing this.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:12.160
 You know, like we're not expecting some big fucking payout someday from like Roland or

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.520
 anything or Electron or whatever because we've mentioned their shit on our show.

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.320
 That would be wild if Electron paid us to shit on their gear.

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:18.560
 Yeah.

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:19.200
 Oh my god.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.640
 That would be kind of, I would respect it.

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.240
 Like some like Dom shit.

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:26.080
 Like, like they just get off on us like shitting on their product and like,

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:26.400
 yeah.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:33.440
 In each one they rate as to like how close we are to getting like a digitone or something like that.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.800
 But that was a little weak.

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:41.280
 But they're all still track, but they're all still just jerking off every time.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.640
 Oh, that's it.

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:43.280
 Abuse me.

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.160
 I am Phil.

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.920
 Electron takes a strange turn.

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.520
 It's just all about us and him at this point.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.760
 Tell me how limited this new Digitact is.

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.000
 Right.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.120
 How bad do you want this black machine drop panel?

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.280
 That was like, I said that in a German voice.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.160
 Jesus Christ.

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.160
 I'm sorry people.

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.560
 You don't want to be me.

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.040
 Surprisingly, we do have listeners over there.

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.160
 Yeah.

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.960
 So let's not let's not offend our German audience.

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:09.440
 True.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:15.520
 We know you guys do more than just talk down to people in sexual manners.

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:22.320
 I was talking about Beargine being in lab and being pissed on.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:28.000
 His concerns of mine were just there and gave the description to me and it was just

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.760
 enthralling talking about walking around.

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:35.120
 I was glad that I had higher heel shoes to make it through the shit.

00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.800
 Oh, wow.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.200
 Yeah.

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.800
 And how the smell of feces permeates a lot of it.

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.960
 I really want to go sometime.

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.520
 Like, you made it more intriguing.

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:45.840
 Yeah.

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:51.520
 Was there anything else you want to talk about with that note?

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:54.960
 No, I just wanted to say that I think it's weird.

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.560
 Agreed.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.040
 Yeah.

00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.960
 And we were already talking less episode how we felt like the whole

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:07.120
 chilling got really bad last year with these types of people and how everyone was

00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.560
 releasing basically the same videos, saying the same thing.

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.440
 Like none of it is per a script but it might as well be.

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.400
 Yeah.

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:14.800
 Yeah.

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.640
 Like for most of these people.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:21.040
 And I think that market is kind of imploding upon itself.

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:26.240
 And I think some people are just going to go quietly into the night and make room for new blood

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:29.200
 who might be more creative and less biased.

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:38.080
 Or these types like him are just going to try to have a desk rip on it and gate keep

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.960
 and cry victim and try to band together and ruin it for other people.

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.560
 Yeah.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.400
 Hopefully it's a former not a latter.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.920
 And start coming with innovations like this, like 15 second menu review.

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:53.200
 Mutable Blinds by polar voltage controlled modulation and mixing.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.880
 How the fuck does nobody else make that?

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:55.280
 What's up?

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.080
 Fun.

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.840
 And a review got new questions?

00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:58.240
 Good.

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:01.840
 Have dad's list.

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.440
 I've wanted a blinds forever.

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:03.840
 Because of that.

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.320
 So good.

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:04.960
 Yeah.

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.440
 So good.

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:05.520
 No.

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.360
 How the fuck did I not get along with this?

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.120
 Like how many things do that?

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:09.440
 Yeah.

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:12.400
 And it's like a bipolar CV controlled mixing and modulation.

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.120
 So useful.

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:13.840
 Yeah.

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.200
 It's hustle hard to get right now.

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:15.920
 Yeah it is.

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.960
 I got one useful.

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.760
 Cyrus wanted one.

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.360
 He was like, yo, blinds looks awesome.

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.160
 I'm like it is.

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.520
 And he was like, how come I can't buy it.

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.520
 I was like, it's a beautiful doesn't exist anymore.

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.040
 Nobody clones either.

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.240
 Not even after later?

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.000
 I feel like they might now.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:28.640
 OK.

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.240
 Some people do like a two channel.

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.760
 Like the DVCA.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.000
 Yeah.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.040
 It's called or something like that.

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.160
 But not the four.

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.960
 And as far as like I've been feeding a lot of voltages

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.000
 into like quantizers and shit and not like doing pitched melodies.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.680
 And it's just fucking awesome for that.

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:47.040
 Bipolar VCA has been very important to me over the last couple months.

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.200
 A few months rather for doing feedback,

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.440
 patching and modulation.

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:51.760
 Yeah.

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:52.240
 Yeah.

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:56.400
 So I don't have a blinds because I couldn't get one when I wanted one.

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.920
 I ended up finding an alternative.

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.720
 It's from nano modules.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.680
 It's called ALT.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.000
 It's a three channel bipolar VCA.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.360
 And then it has a fourth challenge.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.560
 It's like regular VCA.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.280
 Oh, that's very nice.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.080
 Yeah.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:08.320
 Yeah.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.280
 I kind of stumbled upon it in my quest to find a blinds.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.480
 And I was like, this will do.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.800
 Who's what's the manufacturer?

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.840
 Nano modules.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:16.880
 I've never heard of them.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.600
 Yeah.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.080
 They have a couple small utility.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.920
 I have another one by them.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.840
 It's a quad VCA.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.080
 I'm sorry, not VCA envelope generator.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:26.560
 Oh.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.480
 It has three different speeds per channel.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.040
 It kind of reminded me of like aquatics a little bit.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.720
 Speaking of envelope generators,

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.160
 that's something else on my list.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.360
 Oh, what do you got?

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.200
 So it was something else I brought to show off.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.800
 Again, I didn't bother to plug it in.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.080
 I got a from 4MS.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.720
 The single end of a VCA.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.160
 There's a dual NV.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:48.880
 Yeah.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.600
 Okay.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.520
 So, but I just got the single one.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.640
 Full disclosure, I kind of wish I had gotten the double.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:54.960
 Yeah.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.960
 It's really like the single one's really nice.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.360
 And now I'm like, fuck, I want more of this.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.960
 It's really nice.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:01.760
 I think-

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.320
 What made you get that over like the single pig?

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.840
 Like I've been wanting that mini pig.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.960
 Because I wanted the, it's a VCA and envelope tied together.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.080
 Okay.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:12.880
 That's what I was looking for.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.080
 I wanted to sort of have-

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.680
 Isn't mini pig?

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.280
 No, my rock.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:17.760
 Or my rock.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.840
 It's just envelope.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.120
 There's no VCA.

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:21.760
 Okay.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.720
 Some reason I was-

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.960
 Maybe I'm getting these two combined in my head.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.840
 It's possible to get me-

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.640
 You dropped them at the same time.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.600
 They were the same time.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:27.600
 Okay.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:27.920
 Yeah.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.520
 Well, the mini pig was something else I was looking into,

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.720
 but that's a separate utility that-

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.400
 I can review that next time.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.360
 I have thoughts on that.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:37.840
 Oh, really?

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.640
 That I have one.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.600
 Oh, you have one?

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.120
 Oh, I didn't know you had one.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.640
 I got it kind of right when it came out.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.080
 Because I love the pig so much.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.520
 I was going to say you had the full-

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.840
 I've both back in the mix now, actually.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.760
 After I got 301 out of the mix,

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.800
 that freed up a lot of space,

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.720
 because I had the test rack thing too,

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.480
 and the full-size pig went back in.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.760
 Because it has some advantages.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.280
 Well, let me go through this and then-

01:01:59.280 --> 01:01:59.760
 Yeah.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.120
 I kind of want to hear you.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:01.760
 Yeah.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.160
 So the NVCA-

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.320
 It's an envelope, NVCA in one.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.400
 It's got three sliders,

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.640
 and it is rise and fall.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.760
 And the third slider is a little weird.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.480
 It's basically the amount that the internal envelope

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.000
 that's being generated,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.240
 when it has its own independent output.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.120
 Outside of being normal to the VCA,

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.800
 you can use that envelope for something else.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:30.400
 That is basically an attenuator on it.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.640
 So the rise and fall,

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.240
 each have their own separate speed from like,

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.800
 absolutely just like milliseconds,

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.160
 like 12 milliseconds, I think.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.800
 It's three stage.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.000
 It's like fast,

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.000
 mid, and slow.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.280
 And you can set them independently.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:57.040
 It's incredibly snappy to the point of barely audible,

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.600
 to like 12 minutes.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.040
 The range on these envelopes is huge.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.800
 And then it's normal to this VCA,

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:11.440
 and it takes an input and an output for audio,

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.880
 or if you wanted to send CV to it,

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.400
 you could use it in that way too.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.280
 But it seems like it was intended to be with audio.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.200
 One downside is that it's all linear.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:27.440
 However, one of the cool things is there's a time CV.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.000
 And the rise and fall,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.360
 both have a 10 U Verters for this input,

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.640
 which you can then just self-patch the envelope

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.800
 that you're generating into that,

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.800
 to give exponential and logarithmic shapes.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:48.720
 Yeah, it's really very cool to stuff you can do with it over time.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.360
 And I didn't either.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.880
 And it's actually in the manual,

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.640
 which I thought was a really nice bonus for 4MS to be like,

01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:00.960
 "Hey, you probably noticed that there's no ADSR."

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.000
 Well, here's how you make it.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.560
 There's no, it's linear,

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.400
 but here's how you make it different than that.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.280
 Like their little cookbook in the manual

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.640
 was really well thought out,

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.840
 because there is cycle,

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.520
 you can cycle it on and off,

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.160
 which is not super exciting.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:23.280
 However, cycle is its own gate input.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.040
 So you can just send a gate and turn cycling on and off independent,

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.600
 which is weird, but also like,

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.960
 it's kind of cool effect.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.320
 And there's a trigger,

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.360
 like a gate trigger,

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.040
 which does what you would expect it to do.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.320
 But what's really cool is the follow input.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.320
 And what it is is,

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.120
 whenever you have voltage going into follow,

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.160
 it's almost like a slew.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:51.520
 It's the envelope is going towards that voltage.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:56.000
 And that's how you get things like ASR and ADSR

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.280
 from this very, very small footprint.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:04:59.840
 That's cool.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.080
 Yeah.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.360
 So if you send a gate from like a keyboard

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.920
 to both the trigger and this follow,

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.920
 you can get the ASR from that.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.360
 You take the envelope that's separate envelope.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.720
 It's kind of like a hold?

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:12.880
 Yeah.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.280
 Yeah.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:13.680
 Yeah.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.080
 Okay.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.600
 But hold more of like,

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.360
 instead of stopping it where it's at,

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:23.760
 it's the voltage is going at the rate that the rise in the fall is set to

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.840
 towards that voltage.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.080
 God.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.000
 So you actually kind of get like,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.880
 it's more like slew than a proper sample and hold hold.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:33.840
 Like it's not like,

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.520
 okay, I'm going to hold it right here.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.080
 It's more like,

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.520
 oh, here's the voltage up here.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.640
 Based on the rise, the rate of the rise,

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.320
 I'm going to make my way there.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.160
 It's really, it's a,

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:47.040
 for such a small footprint,

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.040
 it does a lot of really cool stuff.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.640
 It's just you kind of have to like,

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.680
 think in the way that they want you to think.

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.280
 Like if you don't,

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.360
 if you just like send the trigger,

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.240
 you got rise and fall,

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.520
 you kind of have a bland,

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:02.320
 linear envelope,

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.360
 normal to a VCA,

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.720
 which is fine.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.760
 I'm sure like,

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.120
 there's a lot of uses for that.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:07.920
 It's when you start

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.840
 plugging all of the stuff in

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.520
 and doing stuff with the inputs

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.360
 and shaping it,

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.840
 you get really cool effects.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.240
 I think it's incredibly well designed

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.080
 to the point where once I got it

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.600
 and started using it and was like,

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.920
 this is a fantastic job.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.680
 Shit, that dual

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.280
 has all of that and a couple more things.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.880
 I honestly,

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.880
 I will be shocked if in the future,

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.800
 I do not get one of the duals.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.680
 I'm a huge fan of it.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.040
 I think they nailed it.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.240
 That sounds, I didn't,

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:41.360
 I thought it was less flexible than that

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.640
 when I first saw it and was like,

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.200
 oh, it's a slow,

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.560
 you know, with the VCA,

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.760
 which I have like javelins

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.400
 and they're cool.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:46.960
 Right.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.840
 I love them actually,

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.680
 but saw that and just was like,

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.720
 oh, I already have one of these,

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.520
 so I like to get it.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.560
 Are the LEDs extremely bright,

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.000
 the point of being annoying?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.520
 They are white LEDs,

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.720
 which is not my favorite.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.880
 I think it's a little brutal,

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.800
 but they're not,

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.840
 no, they're not bad.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:04.960
 They are,

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.400
 they're fucking punishers,

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.040
 is what they are.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:09.840
 Those LEDs.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.440
 But they are,

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.120
 there's a resistor there

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.040
 that shows the intensity.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.000
 So as you have the envelope down,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.760
 it's less bright than when you have it all the way up.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.000
 I probably will scrape them.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.400
 They're the sort of like slider LED

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.920
 that might pop it out and...

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.840
 I use this little LED covers

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.880
 online and they work

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.840
 because it's like,

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.200
 the original peg like to,

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.200
 and so the thing was,

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.080
 first module I built

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.120
 and I've had it in case,

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:39.920
 to some extent,

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.200
 since I got the mini peg,

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:41.760
 it was the only time,

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.640
 first time I took it out,

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.200
 it felt weird.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.760
 I like the mini peg a lot.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.680
 It's got offset

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:51.360
 and a 10-ning version on the output,

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.720
 so you can kind of scale it

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.200
 right there,

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.720
 which is nice and the original doesn't have.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.880
 And it has a detented

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.360
 in potentiometer

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.240
 to control the time

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.160
 and it has more time values,

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.880
 but it's also kind of annoying in that regard.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.520
 And I wish they had like a range switch

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.480
 because it's really like,

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.520
 biddly to get to the value you want to on there.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.560
 Like you can get to it,

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.160
 but I wouldn't want to use it live,

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.480
 whereas the peg I would use live.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:18.800
 They merge the skew

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.840
 and the shape controls

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.800
 into one control

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.120
 instead of having it be two,

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.080
 which is kind of cool.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.040
 I get why they did it,

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:25.920
 it makes sense,

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.960
 but I liked having them individually CV controlled,

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.520
 like it's kind of nice for a modulator like that,

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.480
 to be able to do that.

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.720
 I like both of them,

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:35.360
 it's awesome.

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.480
 I totally recommend it.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.160
 LEDs are too bright on all that stuff.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.360
 I wish they had some

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.880
 potentiartrimmer on the back

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.840
 where you could adjust it

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.360
 or something like some companies do,

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.840
 because theirs are just like super bright.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.560
 Yeah, what else?

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.280
 It's really nice.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.160
 I really like it.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.880
 It does have the magic of the peg,

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.080
 but I like having them both.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.840
 It made me like I had it in a couple of days

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.800
 and it didn't replace the other one for me.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.000
 You know, the original two

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.040
 in this one is just one.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.160
 Obviously, it's like the mini

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.720
 cross modulate.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.360
 Yeah, they work great together, of course.

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:11.920
 Yeah.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.440
 I'm a big fan of range,

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.920
 which is on the low generators.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.560
 And that's what the NVCA has.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.600
 It has the short medium and long,

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.800
 and I think they did a great job

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.720
 of figuring out what that was.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.560
 Like the short is for like

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:29.840
 just that sort of like almost glitchy.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.080
 Like you're not going to make a percussion from that.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.760
 It's the mid is the one that you want

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:34.240
 where you're like,

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.920
 you're going to make a snare sound.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.120
 That's the one you want.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.680
 But if you're doing like a fucking drone set

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.960
 and you want that fucking,

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.360
 you know, two minutes,

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.440
 just letting that fucking ride,

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.040
 you hit it up to slow,

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.320
 and it's all just a tiny switch.

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.000
 And the fact that it's on the rise

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
 and fall independently,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.360
 I think it's a really great idea.

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:56.160
 Like you can have an absolutely tight rise

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.240
 and just a slow asphalt.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.360
 So you get that brick wall up,

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.840
 and then just taper out or vice versa.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.360
 Yeah, I don't have a javelin,

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.680
 but like that was the other thing I was looking at

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:08.720
 before I got this.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.440
 And I think those switches

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.640
 and that sort of flexibility

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.320
 is what drove me towards this.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.280
 I could see that.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.400
 Yeah, like the javelins a lot.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.040
 They've grown on me.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.240
 They're definitely super useful,

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.360
 especially now that I have a

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.280
 DVCA to like de-click some stuff.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.000
 If I need that,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.080
 it's like a super sweet set up.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.520
 I love my DVCA from

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:28.720
 after later.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.920
 Oh yeah.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.840
 There's something weird about the idea

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.920
 that it took so long to get the idea of like

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.400
 if you don't have the outputs,

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.240
 nothing on that output,

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.080
 it's just going to go mixed into the next one.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:40.640
 Right, right.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.160
 Like that's such a great idea,

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.000
 but like it took so long to get there.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.640
 Yeah, that's how it's very similar.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.320
 Like blinds is very just like a

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.600
 voltage controlled version of the

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.200
 phonetronic cascade,

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:51.920
 which I have to,

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.120
 and similar thing like they're

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.320
 chained below.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.000
 So you can see it's like you're doing math,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.280
 you know, essentially with the value

01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.160
 and you see the resulting thing as a cascade.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.560
 It's a nice like way to work.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.240
 It makes sense for me,

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.320
 you know, just my brain.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.040
 So at this point,

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.120
 I have nothing else on my list,

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.280
 and I feel like we skipped past

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.040
 the cosmetics.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.760
 Yeah, we should probably circle back

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.960
 to the cosmic cosmic.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.520
 I forget how we even veered off track with that.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.920
 Well, we started listed it when we started.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.240
 Yeah.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.040
 I just sort of like just like

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.800
 muscled my way in there.

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.640
 Because I'm a big tough guy.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.360
 I kicked a bunch of things over.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.040
 I was like, we're doing my thing.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.480
 Look at my list,

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.360
 it's handwritten.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.800
 So Nick,

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.720
 cosmetics.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.240
 Cosmetics, cosmetics pro,

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.320
 and cosmotronic.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.360
 So you had the original.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.160
 Had the OG.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:44.400
 Yeah.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.480
 Used it for a while.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.040
 I guess I realized it had more noise

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.320
 than I thought when I was trying to do

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.360
 some cleaner stuff,

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.280
 like pasted on, got that,

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.640
 got into the frapped tools.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.840
 Mix got the quad stereo channel,

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.640
 and the group and the output,

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.840
 which I love, like frapped,

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.520
 that mixing is awesome.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.920
 But I got to the point where I kind of

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.520
 wanted another mixer to.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.760
 I realized I have like two stereo outs

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.960
 coming from my modular.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.840
 And that's kind of how I,

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.000
 that's my limit,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.200
 like doing music stuff.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.480
 Like to have those,

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.680
 and I realized I wanted like two

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.360
 concentrators,

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.720
 or whatever if you have two mixers

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.360
 to like funnel stuff into those outputs,

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.800
 and I wanted like effects control.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.840
 Saw the cause mix.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.400
 So one of the things was like

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.040
 ultra low,

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.240
 and it's like super clean.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.080
 Like you can tell he was making like a break,

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.360
 to be like, not like the old one.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.080
 And it has like a true stereo

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.680
 aux end, which is super rare.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.520
 Not any pieces of your hat.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.560
 Yeah, how incredibly rare.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.200
 Because I've hunted for that forever.

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:43.760
 Yeah.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.880
 It was one of the first things I

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.080
 remember when I started making music.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:46.480
 I was like,

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.920
 "Why is this end just mono?"

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.720
 And then people being like,

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.640
 "Tew, ooh, you know, why not?"

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.800
 And I get like why mixers have been that way.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.600
 But for like,

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.720
 if you're trying to do like,

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.160
 sound designing type stuff,

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.520
 like is very useful.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.320
 So I got that after,

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:00.800
 you know,

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.160
 sold the 301 and stuff.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.000
 It was like kind of shuffling stuff around.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.800
 Got it and like tested it out.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.960
 And it's like actually a little quieter,

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.720
 even than the Frappe tools QSC,

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.280
 which was like,

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:11.840
 when I got it,

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.440
 the quietest mixer I'd ever had.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.200
 It was like a revelation.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:15.520
 I was like,

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.200
 "Oh shit, this is like,

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.200
 I would mix gear through this probably."

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.960
 And it would sound as good as anything else.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.680
 I have or better.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.400
 But what did that,

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.600
 because of the true stereo?

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.120
 I wanted more channels.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.160
 It has the clicklist mutes.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.000
 And it also has like a simpler layout.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:30.880
 It's like,

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.560
 looks like a little Mac-y practically,

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:32.880
 you know,

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.560
 it's like very standard layout.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.680
 Sorry to interrupt.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.360
 How many channels does it have?

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.560
 Oh, I think it's like,

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.360
 4 mono 2 stereo.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.160
 Oh wow.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.880
 Oh, thanks.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.440
 Rock's.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.160
 Okay, gotcha.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.040
 It's a lot.

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.960
 It's a good number of stuff.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.720
 One thing about the Frappe QSC

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.320
 is like kind of the way the layout is.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.560
 Like the things that are

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.000
 associated with the channel,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.920
 they kind of line up above,

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.120
 but they're at like angles

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.000
 and kind of jagged.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.200
 That's always throwing me off.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.320
 And this is more like just

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.200
 right in a line.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:01.680
 Straight forward.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.640
 Something about that.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.120
 The protocol layout.

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:03.440
 Yeah.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.040
 Like really helps my brain.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.600
 Big nice lit mute buttons,

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.120
 which every mixer in the world

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:09.920
 should have in my mind.

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:10.640
 They're clickless.

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.080
 10 millisecond delay is how we did it this time.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.360
 On the original one,

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.480
 I thought it was a little like,

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.840
 it was hard for me to use live.

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.440
 It was a little flabby to like,

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.800
 unmute and mute.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.240
 You had to definitely do it before.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.720
 This one is like kind of perfect, I think.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.080
 You almost will think it's off,

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.040
 but then when you use it,

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.640
 it's like you can click it quickly

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.080
 and it's dead on.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.080
 So it's a really nice mix,

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.120
 I think of that functionality.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.040
 Sounds good as fuck.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.160
 I was surprised at how clean it sounds

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.680
 because I did just a quick like.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.240
 So it's clean,

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.080
 but when I was reading up on it,

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.600
 recently, it can get dirty, right?

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.080
 You can't.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.520
 You can push the channels

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.800
 and the game territory.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.600
 You can push the channels.

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.720
 Do you have a separate gain

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.480
 or is this just like after a certain point?

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.760
 I think it just has a lot of head room.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.480
 Gotcha.

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.320
 There's a certain like slider level

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.520
 and above that level,

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.840
 it will overdrive it a little, nothing like the OG.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.760
 I was gonna say, have you experimented with it at all?

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.120
 Like, it sounds good.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:07.760
 Good clipping.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.800
 Are we talking like,

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.080
 Mackie old school clip?

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.440
 Yeah, not even close.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.080
 Okay, okay.

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.200
 Way more calm than that.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:13.680
 Sure.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.080
 Because I still have my version one column.

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.200
 I had two at one point.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.240
 Yeah, yeah.

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.280
 Summed it down to one,

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.000
 which I still like,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.440
 I use it mainly as like,

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.840
 I mean, I know it's a little bit noisy,

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.240
 but I love the distortion circuit

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.120
 that's built into it

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.720
 and the per channel saturation.

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.760
 So I keep it as a effect more so than like a mix

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:32.960
 so you're different than that.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.120
 It's another company made a mixer.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.200
 I would love to have both.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.000
 Yeah, I think that would,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.080
 because it has the Expander connector too.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.880
 And you can just feed the main output

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.240
 right into the like mix of the other one

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.840
 without even using up a channel.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.760
 So wait, wait, so into the original?

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.200
 Yeah, it's interchangeable.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.240
 Oh, shit, that's one of them.

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.760
 Like he has that Expander function

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.960
 and you work between two,

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.760
 which is really cool.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.480
 I think both of them would be ideal.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.600
 I think you'd get your clean,

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.440
 you'd get your like beefy dirtiness of the other one.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.240
 It looks like the perfect live performance mixer to me.

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.080
 Oh, I think as soon as I got it,

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:08.560
 I was like,

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.040
 this is,

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.880
 if I would ever play live with the module again,

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.000
 this would be the core of it.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:12.960
 No question.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:16.160
 It's just so easy to see what's going on.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.360
 You get two sends and returns that are on board.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.760
 Like on the frapples QSC,

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.720
 you got to use,

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.840
 you got to either have the group

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.680
 or you've got to use one of the stereo channels

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.280
 for your effects return.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:27.760
 Yeah.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.640
 And it's only got the mono out there.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.680
 The frapp does have voltage controlled cross fading

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.960
 and then voltage controlled effects

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.360
 sends on a couple of the channels on the outer edge,

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.000
 which is like,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:38.800
 Oh, that's pretty cool.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.200
 Oh, yeah.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.000
 Yeah, that's like why I would never get rid of that.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:42.800
 I would never want to,

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.920
 I like having both of those mixers together.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.440
 It's really nice.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.160
 It's kind of like my weird version of the

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.600
 WMD performance mixer,

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.480
 which is a little,

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.120
 I like the way both of them operate.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.360
 It's very different and do different things with them.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.600
 And there's a lot of cross-ponaching potential too.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:16:59.920
 Right.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.040
 Sometimes I'll take the output

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.880
 and just put it into the frapp tools.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:03.600
 So you have like,

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:06.080
 over half a row just dedicated to these mixers.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.960
 It's pretty close to like half of a 104 HP row.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:09.440
 Yeah.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.160
 Like the mixing.

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.400
 Yeah, including the expanders for the frapp tools.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.120
 Yeah.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:13.760
 Which I like,

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.680
 that'll like my one main case is like,

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.200
 effects and mixing.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:22.000
 In other cases, like analog stuff and oscillator sound sources.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.120
 Then I've got like a modulation case that's focused on that.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.920
 Like, I like having these logical separations now.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.760
 And then like a palette for sequencing,

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.520
 because I do a lot of that in the half-backs.

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.080
 And that's like,

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.920
 been very productive for me to like break stuff up that.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:36.640
 Which I'm thinking,

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.840
 the next move is I'm going to get,

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.640
 I'm going to get some color-coded tendrils

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.840
 and start to patch voices for color

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.320
 and be like, this voice right here is all white,

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.920
 or it's all red or something.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.920
 Man, that is starting to go there.

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:50.640
 That's amazing,

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:58.080
 because I have just a like dog pile of cables and like,

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.280
 you're the length I need,

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.000
 I'm putting you in and then like,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.280
 not even just hours later,

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.160
 like days later,

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.920
 I've got like patches that run,

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.000
 and I'm like building over the course of days.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.280
 And I come back and I'm like,

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.840
 I literally have no idea what you're doing anymore.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.160
 Yeah.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.400
 Like the idea of color coding would be,

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.000
 would solve so many problems with my shitty memory.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.640
 It's good, I do it a lot in a ACV rack.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.600
 I do it a lot in ACV rack.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.400
 Yeah, yeah.

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.360
 Because you had white cables.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.160
 I still do.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:26.800
 Physical.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.360
 Yeah, like.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.000
 And I just like my white cables all along.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.200
 Yeah, yeah, it looks cool.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:31.760
 Yeah, I get it.

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.680
 I've had people shit talk to me from my white cables.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.240
 Wait, really?

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.040
 Yeah.

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.120
 Oh, when the lights bounce off of it?

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:37.600
 Johnson.

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.120
 Oh, really?

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.280
 That's all I'm going to say.

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.000
 Yeah.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:42.640
 Oh.

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.920
 Yeah.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.080
 But yeah, like in VCV rack,

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.680
 because you can color code everything,

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.680
 like it's very handy.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.000
 Yeah.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.840
 And if I remember to do it,

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.880
 but also I don't.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.880
 Sometimes because it's a virtual rack,

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.560
 I can change it after the fact

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.960
 and color code stuff and reverse engineer things a bit.

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.960
 But even still like you're saying,

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.480
 like coming back to it after the fact,

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.160
 I don't remember what the fuck's what anymore.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:04.160
 Yeah.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.960
 So got to try to do it as you're doing it.

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.000
 You know what I mean?

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.680
 To really make the system work.

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.240
 Yeah, but it's something that's come up through

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.000
 just using my system recently.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.320
 Oh my god, this would be a lot easier.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:16.960
 And especially like,

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.600
 oh man, think it'd go back in time

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.040
 and put like behind the panel,

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.960
 clocking standards into modules.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.160
 It would save so much.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.560
 Like I don't change that stuff.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.960
 I just need to make it be like a color

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.800
 so I can just let it disappear

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.000
 when I look at it right now,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.520
 because I don't want to look at those.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.640
 Like I don't need to know.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.280
 I just want to build and trace stuff down more quickly.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.800
 And I think colors could help.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.240
 I remember seeing a comment on Mod,

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.480
 where someone noted that that mixer

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.960
 I think has 28 VCA's in total,

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.040
 like builds into it to make it all.

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:47.680
 Oh yeah.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.880
 Because there's so much voltage

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.880
 can still control stuff in there.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:55.200
 It's a lot of VCA's and a very tight package.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.120
 Yeah, those fuckers get warm.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.560
 I've seen people note that too,

01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.680
 saying it doesn't get hot,

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:00.640
 but it definitely gets warm.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.000
 I love it.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.760
 I think there stuff like is,

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.800
 I like really obviously I've gushed about it on here before.

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:07.600
 And that was like,

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.840
 the passing comment.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.200
 Yeah, it's nice to hear

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.880
 your thoughts on it more and dope.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.880
 Yeah, somebody on one of the patrons,

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.560
 I forget who mentioned that.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.040
 And I just happened to get the Cosmix Pro.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.880
 I figured I'd elaborate a little.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.480
 Either one's a great fucking choice.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.160
 If I was playing live,

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.920
 more I'd go for the Cosmix Pro.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.160
 Yeah.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:26.960
 I think in general,

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.000
 if I really had to choose,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.360
 I would choose the Cosmix Pro.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.480
 Because that stereo is said,

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.120
 it's dope too,

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.200
 to be able to have like a panning sound

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.160
 and be able to reverb it

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:36.000
 and retain the panning without having to use

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.040
 like a separate chain.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.320
 You know, that's kind of,

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:38.880
 yes.

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.520
 Pretty sweet.

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.480
 Oh yeah.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.360
 If you like,

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.960
 your panning to be retained.
