00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.480
 [Music]

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.840
 This episode is just 38. 38. 38. Jesus Christ.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.720
 Climbing. Climbing the numbers.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.840
 Gonna be, uh, I think hard to follow up episode 37.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.640
 Old disclosure, I don't remember anything about 37.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.760
 I don't need it right now.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.320
 It was our doom and gloom episode.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.240
 Modulate to Stoke. Yeah, yeah.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.720
 Where we kind of laid it on about the situation of like components and modular in general.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.360
 I don't know how we went down that road, like that wasn't the plan,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.160
 but we just kind of ended up going down that road and it got kind of doomy.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.040
 It was the WMD announcement because we talked about that.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.880
 Yeah, that's right. That's what tripped it off. Yeah.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.800
 And I guess we struck a nerve a bit. We got some retweets and some mentions out there.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.920
 Yeah. That's good. In the worldwide web.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.280
 Unfortunately though, this is not like the sort of plot twist or, you know,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.520
 the hero arc of redemption. I mean, it's not like a lot has changed significantly

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.120
 in that time since that last episode.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.480
 No. I mean, it's only like, oh, the chips are raining from the sky.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.960
 It's still pretty bad.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.600
 Yeah. A few more companies announced they're stopping since the last episode,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.160
 which was only what? Maybe three months ago, tops.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.640
 Yeah, two or three. Yeah. Maybe two.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.720
 Be able, I think, live stock, electronic shutdown.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.440
 They weren't like a bigger player. They made like the maze.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.160
 Do you remember that? Like it was the matrix thing.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.760
 Yeah, maybe one or two others.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.320
 Hexenburder. I don't remember.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.560
 Hexenburder. Yeah. I don't think we mentioned that one.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.840
 Yeah. I think that was between them.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.760
 And that was also the, you know, the, that's it for the, the mind phaser.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.320
 Yeah. What was the estimate?

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.600
 Two hundred fifty of them. And that was, there are 250 of those on earth.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.200
 And I was always, I was always really intrigued by it. Like not to the point where I got it.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.120
 It took a lot of space. Yeah.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.560
 But as far as like a sound and a complex oscillator, it was always one of the things

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.960
 if I came across one. Yeah. I remember it was like your Easter egg.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.840
 We had a hunt for it. Nobcon. Like two years in a row.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.400
 Oh, right.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.080
 Catch a glimpse of it. Speaking of which, Nobcon just happened.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.760
 Apparently some stuff happened. Apparently it was a, it was not a good one for us to have missed.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.800
 Yeah. Look like a banger.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.640
 Yeah. Yeah. And we missed out.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.760
 And even, I think last time I said like, oh, smaller manufacturers list.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.400
 And then the last time I looked at it, it was like just as big as ever.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.800
 And so it seemed like it was a good time.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.760
 And some announcements.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.800
 Yeah.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.920
 Like big list of manufacturers and people presenting a smaller crowd, I guess,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.520
 due to obvious reasons. Right.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.400
 Which would have been enjoyable for me.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.960
 Yeah.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.600
 You know, we'd have been able to actually spend like some quality time with some of the stuff there.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.000
 It's kind of bummed. We missed it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.280
 Travel so pricey.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.280
 Yeah. And I wasn't boosted at that point.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.800
 I wasn't boosted and I was still sick.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.960
 Yeah. So like now that I'm boosted, I'm like way more, I mean way more into it.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.920
 But at the time I was a little bit like, I'm not really super excited about going to a bunch of like,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.520
 basically disease vectors. Yeah.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.720
 Converging in one spot.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.080
 The con crud. Right.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.640
 Yeah. It was like the week after camp out for me too.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.480
 So I was like, I'm not going anywhere.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.480
 But yeah, the online documentation of it looked like a good one.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.760
 It did. Yeah.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.840
 Yeah. There was a few things there that caught my eye.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.240
 The thought actually in my notes, no con announcements.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.560
 I know there was a couple of things where I was like, yeah.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.920
 Was it the new, I don't know if the new Roland TR 8S or TR6S firmware was announced on that.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.200
 I think Roland was there.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.000
 I think it was. Yeah.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.360
 Something else was announced. I can't remember what it was.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.560
 The, was it the Corg drum machine?

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.160
 Maybe that might have been around that time.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.440
 Yeah. It was around that time.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.680
 Yeah. Well, which I forget the name of already.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.640
 Drum log. Drum log.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.960
 Yeah. This is like the monologue or whatever they had.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.080
 The meaning log monologue.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.120
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.520
 I mean, the drum log looks interesting.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.760
 I don't know if I'm going to run out and get it.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.720
 But I have an eye keeping, keeping my eye on.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.360
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.720
 Yeah. See where it goes.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.360
 The main thing that caught my eye there was the mod-bap trinity.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.800
 Right, right.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.560
 There was a couple recordings of like, you know,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.160
 mod-bap describing what it can do.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.560
 And then there was like a couple one-on-one recordings people made of it.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.720
 So real quick though, what is this?

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.440
 Yeah. What is that?

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.640
 It's a three-channel drum synth module that really has my attention.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.840
 It's digital, right?

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.080
 I think it's entirely digital, but I know one of the models is meant to replicate analog drum.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.320
 Cool.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.600
 Like, you know, you can get your T08, 808 style sounds out of it and such.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.600
 But like, the other models are definitely digital.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.920
 Like, you got some FM, you have like physical modeling, things like that.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.480
 So what about it caught your eye?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.880
 Like, why are you fired up for it?

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.880
 The fact that it's multiple drums in one, it was interesting.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.960
 That's, it's not a super cheap module.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.520
 It's like 550, I think, is the retail, but like, you're getting three drums out of it.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.000
 And it has built-in like mixing saturation.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.560
 The fact that it's can do so many different models, really catches my eye.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.640
 Like, that's what used to appeal to me about like the BIA, for example.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.280
 Yeah, I mean, you could get some, you could work some kick sounds out of it,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.040
 hat sounds, you know, cussive stuff.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.160
 Like it was a versatile module, but creating an array of them, like I did for a minute

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.840
 to try and function as a drum machine.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.840
 Super fucking expensive.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.160
 Right.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.400
 Very.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.960
 Yeah.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.760
 So we compared to something like the LXR module though,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.920
 which sounds like that also would do a lot of what you've just described.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:13.120
 I think the LXR is a good competitor, for sure, and I was close to buying it.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.440
 But you have a lot more dedicated CV on the Trinity than appeals to me.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.120
 It looks like you could really do some interesting sound design on this thing.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.560
 And also the range of it, like the audio range that was in some of those demos

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.320
 sounded really good to my ears.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.680
 Like the kick can go super low, super beefy, and then all the way up to like,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.080
 you know, weird, percussive sounds and things like that.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.520
 The LXR kind of lacks that CV ability.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.760
 Yeah.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.320
 You get more drums out of the LXR, like double the amount of drums for roughly the same price.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.040
 But I feel like the Trinity is way more versatile.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.840
 Yeah.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.280
 So I was really stoked on that.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.040
 And just the models sounded good to my ears.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.840
 You know, like there wasn't any sounds coming out of it that I didn't like,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.880
 which is rare for a drum module.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.680
 Oh, absolutely.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.480
 You know, most of the drum modules out there that I've played with or have heard,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.560
 like I'm not going to be using like 60% of the sounds usually.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.960
 Especially when you have that sort of first reveal video or a couple of clips.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.000
 Normally those first ones are the least appealing for the three of us at least.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.400
 It makes me think like a LXR that's just two drums in a slimmer module,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.080
 like less price, that would be amazing.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.800
 That would actually probably satisfy me for the LXR.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.040
 Yeah.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.200
 And as, you know, we've all discussed here, like you

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.440
 you were diving deeper into drums and module.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.560
 I was kind of backing out.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:36.960
 Right.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.120
 And doing most of them in box and in VCB or act lately,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.240
 Trinity has kind of pulled me back in.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.680
 So real quick question about the Trinity.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.280
 It's three channels.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.920
 Are they identical or do they have distinct different like capabilities?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.280
 Could you make like what you just said?

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.520
 Could you just make three of the same drums?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.960
 You can make three of the same or three completely different sounds.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.520
 Oh, cool.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.800
 They can all be routed out of the sub mix or they can all have dedicated outs.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.000
 For both.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.720
 That is nice.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.040
 Yeah.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.600
 For both.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.280
 So you could send like a sub mix of everything through like an effect while having the direct

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.800
 outs all being processed differently.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.960
 Like that was super appealing to me.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.560
 Is it stereo?

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.560
 I don't think it's stereo.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:18.960
 I think so.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:25.360
 But you could easily like start to make things stereo with all those

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.800
 maximum capabilities like this.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.360
 Um, yeah.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.320
 And just like the way it has like dedicated like character knobs,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.760
 it seemed to just add different textures to the model, you know, and it can all be

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.240
 C.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:38.720
 C.V.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.800
 Every channel has like dedicated C.V.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.200
 As compared to like the LXR where I think you only have like four.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.520
 Yeah.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.960
 You have to figure out where you're rallying.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.320
 You have to rally between what six, seven drum voices.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.200
 You know, so yeah, the flexibility of it really caught my eye.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.920
 I have it on pre-order currently and that's going to be my gateway back into modular drums.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.080
 So we'll see how that goes.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.480
 Seems like similar in spirit to the Winter Modular Collab one, you know.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.920
 Yeah, which still isn't out.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.360
 Oh, that's still not that I was going to ask.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.640
 I was like, oh, did you ever try that?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.320
 No, I thought like I've been waiting for over a year now for that to come out.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.720
 The, um, shit, what was it?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.320
 Zaps.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:20.560
 Yeah.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:20.960
 Yeah.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:20.960
 Yeah.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.440
 Yeah.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:21.920
 Yeah.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.160
 That was like three or four episodes ago.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.400
 Yeah.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.040
 That was a while.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.080
 I forgot about that.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.120
 It's funny because I posted like on Reddit on the module.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.120
 I think someone was asking about the Westlake performer or the, um, eloquencer.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.720
 And I commented on there as like one of the most uploaded things or whatever.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.560
 And it was like, oh, like that's a dead project.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.600
 They have an updated day.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.840
 Like they had this pre pandemic build and just yesterday, and this was like half a year ago

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.880
 that I posted this, someone replied to my comment and they were like, hey, a bunch of us have like

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.960
 taken over that project or something like that.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.720
 And they're going to be updates coming soon.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.840
 And I was like, oh, interesting.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.880
 So I don't know if like Winter Modular like gave that code to somebody because they,

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.320
 they were super cagey about releasing source code and they were just like, oh, yeah, just

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.200
 seemed to be like a neglected stepchild for a while there.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:05.680
 Totally.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.840
 For years, it hasn't had updates even though he's like, oh, I've got these builds with all

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.280
 this stuff, just one more feature.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.040
 So we'll see.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.320
 Maybe they'll give it some love.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.360
 Had a lot of promise.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.560
 Are they putting it up on GitHub or open source?

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.360
 No idea.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.120
 It was like a really big comment.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.360
 Okay.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.000
 Like one sentence, not much detail.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.120
 Yeah, originally I was super excited about that zap.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.000
 You know, I mean, you're the same.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.320
 Really.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.920
 There's a lot of CV capability.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.240
 You could save snapshots and then CV between them, things like that.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.640
 You can't do that with Trinity exactly.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.800
 I don't think you might be able to save your drums.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.680
 I think you can, but I don't think you can see the like change them.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.000
 Right.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.240
 Right.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.560
 But even still like with the amount of CV that it has like, you know, that's really

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.120
 appealing to me.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.960
 And you can just shape what you want.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.520
 And Zaps was only like one voice whereas like this is three.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.160
 I thought Zaps was multi interesting.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.280
 I'm sure you're right.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.400
 That's a big module for one voice.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:02.720
 Yeah.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.880
 So is this out?

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.920
 Is it coming soon?

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.720
 Is it pre-ordered?

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.440
 Like I, I don't know the state of this.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.400
 Expected delivery, I think was early November.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.360
 So about a month away, roughly two months.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:15.600
 Yeah.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.200
 And what was the company?

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:17.920
 What company is it now?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.800
 Well, I have no idea.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.160
 They talked over now.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.800
 Modbap.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.280
 Modbap.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:21.920
 Modbap.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.240
 Gotcha.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.720
 Gotcha.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.560
 I think it is October because I'm drinking a beer that is a normally white and black.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.360
 It's orange and black.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.160
 Yes.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.600
 Look at that spooky.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.360
 Signifying that it's probably October.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.400
 And wait a minute.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.520
 It is.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.880
 No.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.240
 Well, it's on pumpkin ale day.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.600
 It's a pumpkin spice.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.640
 It's a pumpkin ale.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.680
 It's actually not bad.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.040
 It's by a local brewery.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.320
 I bet it is spicy.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.960
 Oh, there's a little bit.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.600
 There's like a like, almost like a molasses type taste.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.000
 But it's not like, it's not like, cloyingly sweet or anything.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.440
 It's like making my stomach hurt just looking at it.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.720
 Yeah, it's not, it's not one of those.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.480
 You, you, I bet there's more than enough.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.920
 Nah, I'm good.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.480
 Be sure.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.840
 I'm going to keep drinking my nasty tea.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.600
 What if this is the thing that actually clears up all of your illness?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.000
 It's just curious to me.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.240
 Yes.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.360
 But in any case, yeah, I think it's October.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.920
 And you're so it's actually pretty soon or ETA soon.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.400
 Yeah.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.800
 It seems like there's a bunch of stuff coming down the pipe for October

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.120
 and November.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.360
 I mean, hopefully it was a real and not just optimistic.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.480
 Yeah.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.600
 Projections.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.800
 Yeah, because I'm excited to try it.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.680
 Any guesses on the new IntelliJail?

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.480
 Cascadia?

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.680
 No.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.560
 Guess in a delay.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.840
 No.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.840
 Just by the nature of the name.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.240
 I think you're probably onto something there.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.480
 Especially because the announcement came right as like,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.880
 Cubit announced their new delay that I forget the name of already.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.920
 It is the Nautilus.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.320
 I have not.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.320
 I have notes on the Nautilus.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:48.960
 Yeah.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.120
 Because I am very excited about that.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.600
 Okay.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:51.760
 Cool.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:51.760
 Yeah.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:51.760
 Yeah.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:51.760
 Yeah.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:51.760
 Yeah.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.280
 If IntelliJail did a new delay,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.960
 I'm guessing it'll be like a more user-friendly rainmaker.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.840
 I would think so.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.400
 I would hope so.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:02.880
 Don't go over now.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.360
 Yeah.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:03.360
 Yeah.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.800
 We'll see.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.440
 And they don't have many effects now that I think about.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:07.600
 No.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.320
 They have like the spring reverb one.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.280
 But like not too many.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.120
 They don't have like a reverb or like a--

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.480
 They do the one you.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:14.960
 Like a one-use delay.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.120
 It can be a chorus delay or reverb.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.040
 And I've always been annoyed that that doesn't exist in 3U.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.200
 Because it sounds like the perfect basic utility effect.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.760
 And it's cheap.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.680
 I'm like, yeah, I would have like four of those in my rack if they existed as 3U.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.840
 I don't have a fancy 1U rail.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.080
 Wouldn't the 1U become fancy?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.640
 Oh, it's fancy.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.000
 And not just a random throw-out.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 You have high brow, high end Cadillac case drivers.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.880
 With your fancy 1U's.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.680
 And you're a little more--

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.560
 And you're self-driving technology.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.040
 Your heated seat subscription.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.360
 Heated modular tile.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.360
 Wow.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.840
 I just have old school clunky ass dope for

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.880
 P9 cases.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.760
 I've heated patchcables.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.880
 Circa 2000.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.200
 Each one has a little 9-volt battery.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.520
 It's a really unwieldy system now.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.400
 But so cozy.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:08.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.320
 And I get an alert whenever I'm working on sounds like shit.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.440
 It calls me and says, listen, this is your--

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.480
 What are you doing, Dave?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.360
 This is your IntelliJel OnStar assistant.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.360
 We're going to have to ask you to stop.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.640
 This is that sounds terrible.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.440
 We're going to have to ask you to take that oscillator out of that filter.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.160
 Exactly.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.200
 It is not a good pick.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.600
 It just speaks to you like how 9,000--

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.240
 Yes.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.280
 Afraid I can't do that, Dave.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.800
 Just start shutting your modules off.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.120
 Afraid I can't stand this anymore, Dave.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.120
 Also, it's just the computer voice for my cats.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.560
 Fuck.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.840
 But yeah, no.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.720
 Circling back around IntelliJel does not have a huge stable of effects.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.240
 I don't know.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.680
 The weird teaser way of announcing something like that is a little weird.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.720
 Like, sure, it's gotten us talking about it, but it's kind of like--

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.880
 Dude, just show us the panel and sound demos.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.120
 Hate it when they-- if you want to tease for like three to five business days,

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.160
 then go right ahead.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.000
 But I just hate when the electron's style, where it's like two months later.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.480
 Yeah.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.080
 Here's a button pad.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.960
 It's like, fuck.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.120
 I'm not into that at all.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.280
 It doesn't-- yeah, it doesn't get me hyped.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.320
 It gets me more annoyed.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.120
 Yeah.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.120
 It makes me want to not pay attention to it.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.680
 Right.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.160
 Right.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:26.640
 Yeah.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.160
 I'm like, no, fuck you.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.200
 Also, as a--

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.400
 Trying to tease me.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.800
 As a kid, I remember that was a big thing of the build.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.800
 Board that just had like a single word on it.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.040
 Right.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.800
 And it was like that sort of like artificial hype generator thing.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.400
 And I'm like, and it was like, oh, what is it?

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.040
 It's so mysterious.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.160
 I have no idea what it is.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.880
 And it was like some Chanel perfume or something.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.760
 Yeah, something--

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.080
 I had no interesting, but like, it always got me.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.720
 I'm like, oh, it's just a black billboard with like two words in the--

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.280
 in the middle of it.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.320
 I'm like, oh, what could it be?

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:54.880
 It's calming.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.760
 Like, oh, fuck.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.640
 What could that be?

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.640
 And then, yeah, it didn't turn out to be.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.360
 It's something dumb.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.920
 So I have a knee jerk reaction against.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.920
 I need an attempt to like capture that.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.000
 Um, that spirit.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.760
 It'd be cool if it was even just more upfront.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.600
 Like, we have a new effect coming.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.400
 Like, don't buy like any effects until this comes out.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.000
 It's like, OK, cool.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.240
 Maybe I wore it like fuck, qubit.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:16.800
 Yeah.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.240
 Coming out with a delay too.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:18.880
 Yep.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.600
 Just do it.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.560
 Just wait.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.400
 We're going to blow it out of the water.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.560
 I mean, it's funny you say water,

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.440
 because it's monoliths and sort of water themed dish.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.240
 Yeah.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:28.720
 Yeah.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.200
 Yeah.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.080
 So I was not--

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.240
 I wasn't super interested at first.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.680
 Because I was like, yeah, I don't need like a delay network thing.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.280
 And like, the qubit Aurora was like interesting,

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.880
 but like wasn't necessarily for me.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.680
 Um, and then there was just more and more of these sound demos.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.320
 And they, they posted them on their site and they were linking to them.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.200
 I'm like, fuck, if that doesn't sound good.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.280
 Like, I'm like, this is actually really interesting.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.240
 And then the thing that really, um, sort of made me like,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.200
 my ears perk up and take notice is they've got this,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.960
 uh, it's called the sonar output.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.920
 And it's gates and CVs that are output

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.480
 from Nautilus based on all of the weird sort of internal logic that it has.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.760
 I missed that.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.000
 Yeah.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.480
 And that's the thing.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.200
 I'm like, oh, shit.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.600
 So you can like, as this like network of--

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.160
 And it's, um, it's eight--

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.040
 It's a stereo delay and it's eight, these eight lines sort of working.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.160
 And you've got control over how they interact and like,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.240
 how much saturation and how much depth and all of these sort of things.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.360
 But as it's making it sort of, um, decisions and processing over time,

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.600
 spitting out CV and gate.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.000
 And I don't have a good--

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.840
 It's a little mysterious right now.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.840
 I don't know what the logic behind it is.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.640
 But I have to admit there's something about the idea of like,

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.880
 actually having that sort of hook into this delay network.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.280
 Right.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.040
 Like, is it a series of like fixed comparators or different voltage levels or something?

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.480
 They don't know.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.840
 Like, or is it like two lines cross and that's a gate or--

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.480
 Or--

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:54.960
 I don't know.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.880
 But it, um, it sort of like, peaked my curiosity in this way of like,

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.600
 what could I do?

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.640
 What could I do with that?

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.360
 Because I don't remember any sort of delay line processor

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.920
 that had this sort of vomiting of its internals on that.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.840
 Plays to your recent like, leebniz kind of a obsession.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.800
 Yes.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.760
 The verbose, um, multi-delay kind of does that.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.560
 Like, it has individual tap outs and also like,

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.360
 the envelope followers for each tap.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.720
 I think that's the only thing that--

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.280
 Which is cool.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.880
 I mean, that's also something amazing too.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.360
 Yeah.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:38.240
 Or the spectral sputnik that I have will generate like, um, envelope based on frequency bands.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:38.720
 Oh, nice.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.480
 So like, which is really cool.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.400
 So as I like sort of like looked into this more,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.880
 one thing that like gave me a little bit of pause is that the settings for this

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.720
 is all done through a web app that generates a file.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:50.960
 Yeah.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.920
 And then you put that onto the USB that goes in the front.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.520
 It's front facing, but there was just like,

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.080
 there was a split second when I was like, oh fuck, I already have a number of things now that have like,

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.280
 web interface configuration and shit.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.000
 And I'm like, do I really want one more fucking thing that's like,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.720
 I gotta go to a website to configure and that's only like,

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.160
 as of right now, the only thing is like kind of, and it's also a little crazy.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.120
 It's like 400 bucks.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.440
 Yeah.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:15.840
 Yeah.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.720
 For a delay.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.280
 Yeah.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.240
 It's up that puts it up there with like the verbose and the rainmaker.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.960
 Or some badass delay pedals that have CV.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.520
 Exactly.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.440
 So this is not a casual purchase.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.640
 Like if it was half the price or like 150,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.720
 if you want to think, so like, I'm going to at least give it a shot.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.160
 So now I'm kind of like, I'm on the fence and also it doesn't exist yet.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.760
 So until I actually see it, I'll believe it.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.640
 I kind of didn't, I wasn't sold on it.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:49.280
 Like, I think the nautilus sort of like most qubit modules that I've played with

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.480
 kind of has like a plasticy bucket sound.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.360
 Like, I don't know how to describe it, but like almost every qubit module I've ever owned,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.720
 I end up not liking it because it has this like tone that I just can't describe other than.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.520
 I know what you're exactly.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.200
 Like being in a plastic bucket.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.600
 Yeah.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.720
 It's fucking weird.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.040
 And it always kind of annoys me.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.360
 And I noticed in the demos with nautilus that it's like present more than ever to my ears.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.400
 I was just like, okay, this all sounds like plastic to me.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:16.640
 Yeah.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.120
 Wow.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.720
 No, I did not pick that up, but now I will have my ears peeled.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.280
 Because the Aurora is kind of like that too.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.560
 But I think on the default firmware, it kind of works in its favor for that kind of spectrally

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.360
 shit. But the moment I tried that like feedback delay network reverb, it was like,

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.880
 I was repulsed by it almost.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:40.320
 Like, oh, this like doesn't sound like, I was trying to use it in the live context to it.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.120
 I'm like, okay, this isn't, it's kind of regular, but it just didn't sound quite right to me.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.920
 Like the effects aid was immediately better and more like what my ears were looking for.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.400
 And I switched it back to the Aurora and was like, okay, cool.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.160
 And now it's like what I want.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.080
 But I don't, yeah, I don't know.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.840
 I don't know about their effects like you're saying.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.640
 Yeah, well, even like, what was it?

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.560
 The nebula that I had from it.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.040
 Everything came out of that sounding plasticy too.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.560
 It was kind of annoying to me.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.800
 The, yeah, I agree.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:15.760
 The default mode of Aurora was like the only time that I felt like that plastic sound worked okay.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.160
 Yeah.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.720
 And like, you know, was ignorable to me, but everything else always sounds plasticy.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.280
 I don't know why I don't know how else to describe it, but it's just kind of like there to my ears.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.360
 Well, now I'm going to add that to the list of cons on my list of present cons.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:31.920
 Yeah.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.840
 It's just going to say plastic bucket.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.880
 Plastic bucket.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.840
 Plastic bucket.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.400
 Do you have a list of cons other than price?

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.320
 No, just price and the web setting app outside of that.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:42.320
 Yeah.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:42.720
 Yeah.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.640
 I thought it sounded good.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.840
 What if things seems like you could probably just kind of set it and forget it?

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.200
 Maybe, you know, it's not something you had.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:49.680
 I'm hoping that's the case.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:49.680
 Yeah.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.800
 Going back to it often.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.760
 Yeah.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:51.920
 Yeah.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.080
 And if it really ends up being just like low level stuff that I'm not changing that often,

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.040
 it won't be that big of a deal.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.440
 And honestly, it's not a big con.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.520
 The big one is just that that's a lot of money.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.160
 I already have two effects aids and maybe that $400 could go somewhere else, but...

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:06.480
 Sure.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.920
 And the sound of shadows, no.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.280
 Yeah, and the sound of shadows.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.080
 But I have to admit the sonar output.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:12.960
 And again, you're right.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.320
 This is probably just my...

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.120
 My lead knits.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.440
 I've been neck deep and lead knits for a month or two now.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.160
 Just anything that's randomly setting out,

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.200
 Gates and CV is going to catch my attention.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.560
 That's what I'm into right now.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.040
 Cool.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.280
 Yeah.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.760
 I'm curious to hear how you drive with it.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.080
 Yeah.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.680
 I mean, it's not a done deal.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.560
 Yeah.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:38.640
 But I do like drinking and I do make dodgy purchases while I'm drunk.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:44.720
 So, I've ever talked about the time that I went on an Etsy tabletop war game,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.840
 Terrain, Spree.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.880
 We're playing this game, Rangers of Shadow Deep.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.560
 And it needs tabletop terrain, like trees and rocks and sort of stuff.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.360
 Grass.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:55.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.760
 Well, you can get away with not having grass.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.440
 You can have like a big matte top soil...

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.160
 Fire hydrant with a dog humping it.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.320
 You do need the fire hydrant with a dog humping it.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.360
 But I'm like, I'm going to get a couple things.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.320
 I was like, I'm going to get a tiny little house and maybe some fence and a rock.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:20.160
 And basically, I got blackout drunk and just started buying anything.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.160
 It was all from different Etsy sellers.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.400
 So, I'm like, you know what?

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.080
 I'm not even going to look to see what I bought.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.040
 It was for like three weeks every day I'd go out and like,

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.120
 "Oh, here's more shit out every later."

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.680
 This is again.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.240
 Exactly.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.920
 Here's more shit I evidently ordered.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.760
 So now I've got like a fucking like small village.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.280
 That's kind of awesome.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.600
 So that is how I imagine I'm going to end up with a cubit nautilus.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:43.840
 Nice.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.760
 That's how I ended up with a few things while I was sick.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.320
 Like, I was wasn't sleeping because I was just coughing my brains out all night.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.880
 And I'll jacked up on whatever the fuck they put in and that breathing

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.680
 treatment shit they gave me and steroids in the whole nine yards.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.240
 So I was just like...

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.120
 Plus all the cold medicine.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.000
 Like I was just on another fucking planet for like two weeks straight.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.880
 And then the same deal.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.000
 I would come down, check my mail, and then all of a sudden there was like a new module box.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.280
 I'm like, what am I doing?

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:11.920
 You know what I mean?

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.160
 It was like, I was trying not to buy anything but ended up with some shit.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.920
 Other Greg is making this difficult for me to pay my bills this month.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.480
 Yes.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.000
 Other Greg is having a great time, but other Greg is becoming a problem.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.720
 Very much so.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.880
 And then I had to remember that I will have hospital bills coming and shit too.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.200
 And I was like, no, I really shouldn't be buying shit right now.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.560
 In fact, I even had to cancel my Perkins pre-order.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.360
 Oh, unfortunately.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:35.920
 Because of that.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.960
 I was like, all the hospital bills added up to like the cost of a Perkins pretty much.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.800
 And I was like, well, there's my Perkins.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.720
 So what number in the Perkins line at Sweetwater did you rise up to?

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.080
 I think 111.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.280
 No, so you made some moves.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:49.520
 Yeah.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.200
 Yeah.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.480
 I was getting up there and...

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.800
 But actually I heard that those are getting delayed even further.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.360
 Mm-hmm.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:57.680
 Yeah.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.400
 So I don't fully regret it.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.680
 It sounds like they're not...

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.640
 It's nebulous now that they will even ship out in November.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:04.960
 Yeah.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.840
 So...

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:12.160
 And I think I also saw that a couple of places got a shipment of pulsars and like restock of pulsars.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:12.400
 Yeah.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.480
 I think they're competing.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:14.720
 Yeah.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.040
 Yeah.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.040
 Yeah.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.520
 And like we called it whenever Perkins was first announced.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:17.920
 Right.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.520
 It seems to be that way right now.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.880
 Like the most...

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:26.320
 Most people compare like, I'm going to spend two grand on all your dumb machine.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:26.800
 Yeah.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.880
 Is it going to be Perkins or is it going to be Paul Sar?

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.920
 But it did seem like Paul Sar was like, but we're actually here.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.480
 Yes, really.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.120
 If you have the...

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.600
 That's true.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.280
 You're in line for that other thing.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.640
 We got this actually available.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.760
 You can actually buy this.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:44.960
 There was a grip of pulsars that showed up used to right when like Perkins supposedly started like shipping out.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:50.080
 That's a lot of people were curious to try the other side of the street.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:50.400
 Right.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.840
 Fadeski Mastering.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:07.040
 V-A-R-E-S-C-H-I-Mastering.com.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.000
 I'm done with this project and sounds bad.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.760
 What do I do?

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.200
 How about Vadeski Mastering?

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.040
 That's cool.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:25.040
 Philippe will work with you to get you where you want your sound to fucking go.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.680
 V-A-R-E-S-C-H-I-Mastering.com.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.800
 Philippe will help you with your sonic issues.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.840
 So, Nick, do you have anything on your list?

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.800
 Yes.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:46.720
 Speaking of drum machines, the TR6S, which was kind of a probably somewhat altered Amazon purchase because

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.000
 they popped up.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.920
 They're normally like 500 bucks.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.880
 And I was always like, cool.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.760
 It's like mini TR8S, which I've had and sold.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.600
 But I missed.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.800
 I liked playing live shows with it, compliments the rhythm really well.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.600
 And they were selling for like 260 bucks for like a week on Amazon.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.120
 Yeah, that feels kind of insane.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.000
 It was ridiculous.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.400
 I'm so psyched I went for it because I love it.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.760
 I'm bummed that I missed it.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.640
 Same here.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.880
 I knew about it, Russ, and posted about it and all this stuff.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.520
 And I basically did the thing of like, oh, I should get that.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.880
 But then didn't get drunk enough to actually make the purchase.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.520
 Yeah.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.240
 Actually have it.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.200
 Oh, shit.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.520
 That's a cute show in my bag.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.200
 Like if I am hanging out.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.240
 That's so horrible.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.000
 First off, the case for or the lid.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.200
 Yeah, a little deck saver.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.800
 That is really fucking nice.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.680
 Deck savers are great.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.040
 Then you don't need to get another bag and you can just throw it in your book bag.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:44.720
 But I fucking love the TR6S, dude, especially since the latest updates with the FM

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.120
 drum.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:45.440
 Yeah.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.880
 And the probability.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.680
 That almost got me to buy another TR8S.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.560
 Yeah.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:50.720
 Yeah.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.120
 But I was like, I don't want, I can't spend that money right now.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.120
 Oh, I like this more.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.880
 I think it's like the perfect size.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.440
 It's like things are literally like closer for your hands if you want to edit it.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.760
 So real quick for our listeners, can you give us the elevator pitch as to what this is?

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:12.320
 So this is the Roland TR6S which came out after the TR8 and then TR8S.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.800
 So it's like a baby TR8S that actually just has fewer channels.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.480
 I forget how many are on the TR8S.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.360
 Do you still have one?

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:19.840
 No.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.080
 Yeah.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:20.160
 Yeah.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.080
 This one just has six.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.800
 And it just has one group of three knobs to edit.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.320
 So it's kind of like soft knob style.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.800
 You like select the drum you want, pick the thing.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.840
 Other than that, you can even, I think, load like, I don't know.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.280
 I think you can load TR8S stuff and it'll just truncate it at six channels.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.960
 But it's the same thing.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.240
 Same synthesis engine.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.160
 Sounds fantastic.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.320
 It's a little different in that it's powered from USB, no AC adapter.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.120
 But that's fine.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.920
 The one thing I realized is like, oh, it's nice.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.480
 I can power this by the IntelliJell tile in my modular,

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.000
 but there's a ground loop hum with that.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.600
 So I've got like, roll with a phone charger, which is just fine.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.480
 It's got full size MIDI in and out, which is great.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.880
 Quarter inch outputs in an SD card.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.000
 And that's pretty much it.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.600
 So it's like stripped down.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.560
 Looks like just one pair of outputs compared to like TR8S.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.880
 No individual outs.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.320
 I know there's a dedicated headphone.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.840
 There is dedicated eighth inch headphone in the front.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.200
 I use all the time.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.760
 There's no tap button, but you can just shift tap this.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.080
 Like it's really not bad to edit.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.520
 You can shift edit anything.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.920
 The editing capability on the little screens cool.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.720
 Honestly, I think it's like one of the coolest thing to like make full tracks with even

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.000
 like portable in your bag because it's like you get little synth sounds.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.160
 They neuter a little bit.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:41.840
 You can't pitch by note the samples and you can do that on the TR8S, I think.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.240
 And on the MC 101 and 707, you can't really do it on this.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:52.080
 They have a lookup table with like this parameter corresponds to like this pitch roughly.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.360
 It would be really nice if you could like pitch things on this, this little keyboard,

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.160
 it would be killer.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.040
 What's on the screen?

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.160
 I see there's a screen at the top.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.120
 What does that do?

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.080
 That's all your editing parameters, like all the effects you're going to pick.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.200
 Like that's how you go about editing the drums and the FM stuff and any other drum models.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.760
 So you can just shift that and it's over here.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.320
 Yeah, that's what made me sell the 8S ultimately.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.320
 Trying to edit everything through that tiny little monochrome.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.040
 Yep, it was driving me kind of crazy.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:25.760
 And it's not like the MC 707 at least had a bigger screen than had a little more information.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:32.240
 It's still a little divey, but even like for my purposes, I'm like using this live to layer

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.000
 on top of the rhythm for the most part.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.600
 And like it's just like the 808 909 stuff and some other drums.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.600
 The little sliders are super rad live when I practice with it.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.360
 Like I'm really psyched on the output seems a little low to me.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.920
 I don't know why like compared to the rhythm, which has more volume.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.440
 But once you get that like dialed in, I see there's an SD card in the back.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.520
 What what are you saving loads from that?

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.920
 So you can load like your I think just sample transport.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:03.040
 I think you can export setups onto it too and then load them from there.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.520
 It's really cool.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.720
 I love it with the rhythm.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.760
 I think it sounds perfect.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:14.640
 Between this analog rhythm and the squid sample, I'm like, I can get any kind of drum flavor I really

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.920
 want for the most part.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.480
 Really, really satisfied with it.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.400
 I'd like the eight variations.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.640
 Somehow for me, it seems like easier to use than the TR8s.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.440
 I don't know why.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.600
 How do you do the variations?

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.800
 Like I don't see the little pattern.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.400
 It's missing.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.560
 You just hit like shift and go over here or shift and variation.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.480
 And then these light up and you can just toggle between them or like group them together.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.000
 So it's really easy to dupe stuff and make variations.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.440
 It's another thing that you can like save while it's running to and like it doesn't stop.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.160
 So I can save my whole live set right now.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.080
 Like while it's running, it's just cool.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.000
 It can keep going, which I dig.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.360
 Can you do any ratcheting or micro stuff stuff on there?

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.680
 You can do micro step.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:03.200
 They have like sub steps is the version on here.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.800
 And then you can kind of change how those work.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.640
 Can you program like a role basically?

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.600
 Yes.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.640
 That's what the sub steps do.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.600
 And if you get triplet, there's some configurability within that.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.400
 I forget how.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.000
 I wish these pads were a little bigger.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.320
 Like you can hit them live, but I bet I'm going to fuck it up live maybe.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.360
 Do you mind if I hit one?

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.040
 I mean, they're nice though.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.200
 Not velocity sensitive.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.440
 So you don't get velocity sensitivity.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.000
 I was able to isolate to just one and I got big beefy hands.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.080
 So it wasn't too bad.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.000
 From here, it looks like it might be kind of tiny.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.840
 Yeah, but you can still manage.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.280
 Like it's really not that bad.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.200
 And I think I have the circuit tracks too.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:47.120
 This is actually more fun just to like sit on the couch with and play for me.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.000
 I don't know.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.680
 They're drawing modeling on here sounds really good.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:54.640
 It's a lot more satisfying for me than the MC-707 was with just the sample based approach.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.120
 No.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:57.680
 No.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.120
 Oh wait, can you?

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.120
 Oh yeah, no, I'm sorry.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.800
 You can definitely power with batteries.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:03.280
 Battery?

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.160
 Yeah, that's awesome.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.120
 Gotta have them in here.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:05.760
 That is cool.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.280
 So it's pretty portable.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.000
 They did a great job with this.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.400
 I think it's at first I thought it was stupid.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.520
 And I was like, why do they make that small little thing?

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.280
 And I know exactly why.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.280
 Especially for 260 bucks.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.120
 That is like the fucking most powerful drum machine you can get for that money.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.280
 So does that price no longer exist then?

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.120
 It's not that I've seen.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.640
 It was like a couple days and I'm so glad I went for it because the next day it was gone.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.040
 What's it like on reverb right now?

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.920
 I think they go like three to 400.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.840
 You can probably get them like 300 on reverb.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.200
 They're like 400 retail.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.360
 And boom, that sounds so good.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.720
 260 dollars I would snag one for sure.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.280
 All's good.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:45.840
 All's good.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.040
 Automation.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:47.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.720
 It's incredible.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.360
 Like a really...

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.720
 I kind of thought that would be like the new price.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.200
 You know what I mean?

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.560
 That's what I thought you said that was a price.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.360
 I'm like, okay, cool.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.040
 I'll scoop one maybe someday.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.280
 Because it was right when the new OS dropped.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:33:59.600
 Right.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.400
 And it was the official like roll-in store on Amazon.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.040
 And they had a few other stores that dropped prices to compete.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.040
 But then they went like right back up.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:11.040
 Yeah, like you're saying even as like something to take to the cabin.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.440
 You know, like on a road trip jam or something.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.120
 It's in the back very nicely.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.000
 Yeah, like I can take it somewhere and still make progress on the lives that are still

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 make like a very satisfying beat.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.600
 I have a problem with the circuit tracks.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.560
 It's just not like super satisfying to use ever.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.000
 It's cool and I'm going to probably put more time into it over time.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.920
 But like this is just so much more fun.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.040
 Super fucking useful.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:33.920
 It's adorable.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.480
 It is.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:34.720
 Yeah.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.840
 It's super adorable.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.080
 In that stupid little deck saver.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:38.800
 Does it come with that?

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.080
 Did you have to get that after more?

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.040
 I got it off Juneau.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.280
 Juneau is the place to get deck savers.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.160
 I didn't realize they're always like 10 bucks cheaper than anywhere else.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:46.480
 Okay.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.880
 Yeah, because some of those are kind of pricey.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.600
 Like my delusion was like 60 bucks.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.400
 Which was like.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.200
 Yeah, I think my Taroza one was around 60 bucks.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.440
 Yeah, the half-ax was 40 or something.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.520
 Yeah, they are discounted ones.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:34:59.840
 It seems.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.360
 And you got to get it from the UK.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.840
 And it takes a little longer and they don't like track things.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.000
 But like, but yeah, when you realize like you're going to get

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.400
 some kind of case to play it live or take it somewhere.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.760
 And this is the smallest one.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.880
 I can just it's like in my bag a lot of the time now.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.600
 So fun to just bring it around and use it.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.600
 Hell yeah.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.800
 Well, I'm super jealous.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.240
 Yeah, I know it's I highly highly recommend this.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.400
 I think it's even at the regular price.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.160
 I think it's fucking super tight.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.760
 Especially if you want like it's a lot more fun than using 808 909 samples.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.080
 Right.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:32.320
 Right.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.600
 And it sounds amazing.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.440
 Yeah, the virtual analog emulation stuff always sounded better to me than sample.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.800
 Yeah, definitely.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.720
 Like I didn't like that.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.800
 I don't like the Zen core synth engine.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.520
 That's the main reason I sold the MC 707.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.080
 It's I just really didn't like that synthesizer.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.840
 I just didn't think it sounded great.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:59.040
 I don't like the classic JD or JV kind of rolling preset ronblar sounds.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:35:59.680
 Right.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.560
 I get that they're classics, but I just I don't like working with them.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.960
 Not fun.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.240
 You have the real deal still.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.520
 Right.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.000
 Which one?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.040
 Don't you have a june or you have a Jupiter, huh?

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.000
 I have a Jupiter six.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.320
 Yeah.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.520
 Which I'm probably actually going to sell again.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.000
 You've been on the cusp of selling that for a while now.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.120
 Once it was fixed.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:19.920
 Chase fixed it.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.560
 Working great for a while.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.080
 Started to have problems again.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.400
 I kind of know what to do, but I'm just like honestly what I want to do.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.360
 I want to sell it and get in Udo super six.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.160
 That'd be awesome.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:32.480
 Yeah.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.440
 Because I could probably sell it for more than that.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.240
 And make some money.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.640
 And those are like 2500 for the desktop.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:38.800
 Yeah.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.360
 It just it's like seems to cover similar territory.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.840
 And I'd have something that's not 40 years old.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.160
 Right.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.480
 Because ultimately you still like the sound of that Jupiter.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.520
 Yeah, it's okay.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.000
 No.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.640
 Like I don't like the envelopes, which I've said before.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.000
 The filters are amazing.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.440
 The oscillators are amazing.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.880
 I think the envelopes are shit though.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.120
 Right.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.000
 Kind of ruined this point.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.080
 I would just keep it as like a display piece of nothing else.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:00.640
 Oh yeah.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.200
 It's chilling next to your 808 or something.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.400
 So you're keeping it for the flex.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.080
 Is that what you're saying?

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:06.400
 Yeah.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.480
 I thought it was one years at the speed too.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.840
 So now you kind of resent it.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.480
 Like there's like.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.280
 Oh I do.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.480
 It's a bad animation.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:14.880
 Yeah.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.360
 Not a good one.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:17.840
 Yeah.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.880
 TR success.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.680
 Go out and get one.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.080
 If you can.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.360
 I'm glad you brought it actually.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:26.160
 Because I feel like seeing it up close and running through it real quick

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.160
 really sells.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.160
 I think really sells it in a way that verbal description may not have done otherwise.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:39.120
 Because especially having to use some of those other TR or the new TR stuff from Roland

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.360
 which were fine but they were monstrous.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:41.600
 Yeah.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.880
 TR-8S is pretty big.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.120
 Yeah.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.120
 And with that editing style you would think like more knobs is better on the TR-8S.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.800
 Like I'm not editing multiple drums at the same time very often.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.160
 I'm going from one drum to the next.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.520
 We can get it where I want.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.400
 Making the sequence.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.480
 Calling it a fucking day.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:02.320
 So it's really not even it doesn't feel awkward to me to edit it in any way.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.400
 And the MC-707 that felt like horror show compared to that.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:06.880
 It was just.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.240
 Yeah.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.920
 That was not a good time for me.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.560
 Right.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.600
 Have you had a chance to dive into the new FM firmware stuff at all?

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:13.840
 Yeah.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.160
 Yeah.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:14.960
 It's cool.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.000
 It's a lot of fun.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.560
 Weird shit.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.600
 Really appealing to me.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:17.920
 Yeah.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.120
 It's stuff you wouldn't get very different than the LXR.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.600
 Obviously it's way more like clean kind of FM stuff but you can get some nice like

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.240
 donks you know kick your hums like.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.080
 Yeah.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.600
 It's they did a good job.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.840
 And also the web editor.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:39.040
 I haven't used that much yet but I just saw John Ruderman just did like promo promo for them.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.440
 Like with the new stuff and the new web editor.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.080
 So I'm actually going to try that out just to like make some kits and see.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.440
 Yep.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.440
 The FM stuff is definitely appealing to me.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:56.000
 Lately that's kind of been like the root of my drums lately is FM based plugins and VCV and also

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.720
 in my rack.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.240
 Like I've had both of my plates in FM mode.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.960
 Had my rings in FM mode.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.720
 I recently got a.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.840
 What is it?

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.480
 ALM.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:12.640
 One of the dink chemis.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.760
 Would you get a case?

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.400
 A chemis.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.040
 Alchemis.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.160
 Alchemis.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:16.720
 Alchemis.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.120
 Alchemis.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:17.520
 Take a.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.720
 Oh that thing's awesome.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.520
 I want that.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.080
 I finally got one like I remember.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.000
 Sean.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.600
 I should I remember what name he uses now but I guess Sean dementia is fine.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.400
 I think that's yeah.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.120
 I think that's.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.840
 But yeah that was one of the first models he got and he spoke highly of it.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.440
 And I was like yeah it's always kind of caught my eye like so did the castle you know.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.920
 And I always thought like maybe I should just get the alchemis castle but no I got the little

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.840
 taco joint that was a.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.440
 Out of mind sick purchase.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:47.920
 Right right.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.240
 Grab one.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.120
 It's a good old river.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.680
 Yeah.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.560
 It appeared and I forgot I even ordered this and I was like oh yeah.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.280
 But cool.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.440
 I fucking love it.

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.320
 Like it's awesome.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.240
 I know it's an old module at this point but like yeah I feel like I've really

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.400
 been missing the boat on that one.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.520
 I went over to Luke's and he had Tysodico and that one and I fell in love with both of them.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.720
 Pretty much immediately and got the Tysodico and it's still like great.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.600
 I really like it.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.640
 It's super cool.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:20.480
 I can tap into what I used to try to do with the BIA a lot and it seems like it's more versatile.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.160
 That's what I think about the Tysodico.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.360
 I'm like oh this like I felt bad about the BIA and then I got that.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.360
 I'm like no this is like super flexible.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.000
 It's cool.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.640
 It's neat and you can even get like weird kind of like arpeggiations out of it.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.360
 Super weird.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.080
 Things that I didn't expect to do melodic stuff with it but you definitely can.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.840
 Yeah I mean like I just wanted to do like weird wonky FM percussion with it.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.000
 Right.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.960
 But yeah you can actually use it as like synth voice.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.720
 It's neat.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.920
 I don't know how to describe it.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.400
 It's awesome.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.840
 I still need to spend more quality time with it but so far yeah I'm like not

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.360
 regretting my purchase at all.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.320
 Have you checked the castle?

00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:00.640
 I mean I've looked at the videos for it and I'm like yeah this is awesome and huge but like

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:07.120
 I'm not an FM wizard like you and like it kind of intimidated the shit out of me at the same time.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.200
 I was like David Prey like this you know I mean.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.880
 That was one of the ones I was between that and the humble quad.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.280
 Yeah.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.240
 Those were the two that I like that was the tough decision.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:16.560
 Right.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:21.120
 Which one to get and I ended up going with the humble quad but every once in a while I'll

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.560
 see like somebody post a video of like them doing something on the castle and I'm like yeah.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.440
 Vahk do I need to get do I need to get that too?

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:27.680
 Yeah.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.080
 You might.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:32.400
 Because I mean the taco was like one voice of that.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:38.720
 Yeah and I can't even imagine having four with more options too like it's probably incredible.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.440
 Yeah.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.480
 You know but I love their stuff too they're just good at making the more I use

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.120
 all my stuff the more I realize they're really good designers.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:47.600
 Same here.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:53.760
 I don't have much of it like I have PAMs workout with the expander which I love like it's

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.840
 so fucking versatile and I have a Tango Quartet.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:03.360
 I haven't and I used to have the the Sid guts the Lux forgot about that.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.640
 That was them right?

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.680
 Yeah that was yeah.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.320
 Okay.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:08.640
 Yeah.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.160
 Yeah I like that but it was kind of you know one tricky then yeah yeah at the time I was

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:19.360
 trying to like downsize my my oscillators and having the sandwich said I'm not getting

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.400
 a sandwich said or a MIDI Bach and a module in it.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.040
 I was a little disappointed with it that said it still sounds fucking incredible.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.640
 It's a really interesting module.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:34.000
 It's just it's pricey you can still get it at analog haven and it's like 360 bucks without

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:34.800
 the Sid chip.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.440
 Yeah.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.400
 You got to bring your own.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:43.200
 And similarly I don't have that many I have an I also have a Tango Quartet and I have their

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.880
 little envelope the pip.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.240
 Oh you got the pip slope.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:53.760
 Yeah I mean like a 4a tiny little 4hp envelope again I think they just they've got a good

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.520
 sense of what makes a good module.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.960
 Yeah I'm really curious about their newer newer ish multi-effects.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:08.320
 MFX yeah yeah they just updated it to with the new the company I work for their parent company

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:13.440
 put out new ADAC or ADDA chips and they put them in that and that was the way they were

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.440
 able to make they couldn't get those they revved it and did new ones so now they can

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.640
 make MFXs again.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.200
 Cool.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.440
 Like better headroom now the new ones too.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.280
 I'm real curious about it I just haven't had a chance to like pull the trigger on it.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:25.760
 Right.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:31.520
 And you have a you finally joined the FX aid brigade hasn't arrived yet but yeah I have

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.600
 one coming from signal sounds finally and you got the pro I got the pro.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.640
 That's the one.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.520
 Yeah I was real close to rebying a ZDSP because I've been missing my halls of a holla.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:49.120
 But I was like no I've used that to death I should try something different.

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.320
 You'll like this I think.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.200
 I hope so.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:51.840
 Yeah.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:58.960
 Um will it replace halls for me I don't know like I've been back to using the VSTs.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:06.080
 Yeah you know the the I can't remember because there's so many of them but like the havahala

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:14.320
 shimmer yeah delay plate yeah the need rule one the hauler room that's yeah that's what I've

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.720
 been using the most yes well the weird names those aren't in the plugin though those are those

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:26.560
 were just the DSP the ZDSP cart like the Nifalom are yeah yeah but I'm pretty sure the algorithms

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:33.600
 on the ZDSP cart were from the hala room I love those algorithms on that cart like I but

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.760
 I've used them to death like over the last few years and it's like okay time to switch it up a

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:46.480
 little bit I really wanted just a reverb that had more to offer like as far as control goes like

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:52.800
 you only get three parameters on pretty much any of these effects modules the ZDSP you have like

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:58.960
 three the effects aid you have three I think this new ALM one I think you have three I mean unless

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.960
 you're going into like the strum and territory you're talking about devices I think you have

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:07.600
 three of three so like I was kind of annoyed by that and like I spent a lot of time the other

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.520
 night just like researching effects pedals and I was real close to pulling the trigger on an

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:17.120
 Empress reverb yeah and just being like fuck modules all together none of these offer the

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:24.720
 amount of features that I want but the the Empress you get a lot of options but like you can't

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:29.520
 CV them you know I mean so I was like do I really want to know there are CV what's there's the weird

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:37.200
 Empress that is the euroboro or whatever yeah the one is like euro friendly or the Zoya or

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.280
 something like something like that but it has CV and I think you can even rack it I think you

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.240
 can take it out it's a collision and rack it that those just look like a fucking mess to me

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:51.760
 oh yeah I was not yeah the interface is like no no that's they set like the ben jordan did that

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.960
 one video and I've looked at a couple other videos and I'm like sonically this isn't bad

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:04.880
 usability though I don't talk about it if I could just get a Empress reverb as a module I would buy

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.600
 it immediately yeah like without hesitation I would get the delay to immediately and yeah and the

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:15.520
 delay absolutely I want the delay kind of right now but I'm gonna do it I just want it for the

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:21.440
 show and it's just like it's stupid it's not that expensive you know like I was looking at the delays

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.520
 too when I was looking at the river for some reason on reverb when I was searching Empress reverb the

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:31.120
 delays were in the search results too so I was like just eyeball knows and comparing prices but

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.720
 it gets to like 499 list but you can get it for like closer to four

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:43.360
 but yeah overall I was just kind of frustrated at the lack of good reverb options yes you know I

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:49.600
 had the star lab for a minute and that did have some good CV control but like at the same time

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.400
 you only have three different algorithms on that which aren't even like algorithms it's like

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.240
 three different spaces it's like kind of super limited and everything that comes out of star

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:03.040
 lab kind of sounds the same it's like you're just doing slightly different takes of the same

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:08.720
 sound you know that is nice thing about the FX8 though is because there's so many different

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:12.880
 algorithms and they're basically these different models and especially we do getting the pro and

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:18.880
 having just go get me all of them again you're right it's only three CV inputs but three's been

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:24.080
 fine yeah I'm not really that's not really been a huge limitation to me I'm also used to the ZDSP

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:30.560
 having a similar sort of like here the three they gave you now do your work the other thing about

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:39.200
 FX8 this is a segue Greg I'm lobbing this up for you yeah is they've got a model the generation

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:48.160
 lost like is this right yeah generation lost petals generation loss petal yeah that as I do not

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:54.400
 have one of those I've been super fucking stoked on it just being able to have that I think it sounds

00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:02.160
 amazing it's not exactly like a petal I don't know anyone who has that petal yeah so I know you

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.960
 know like I'm not doing great great oh wait what's that oh shit do you know someone who has that

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:14.160
 petal Greg what's this sitting here on the table look at that spot list a generation loss the most

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.960
 dip switches I've ever seen on that petal yeah I mean that's kind of what chase bliss is known for

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:27.200
 like they're weird dip switch system you know yeah um so Greg tell the listeners what it is that I

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:34.480
 expertly set up for you to talk about well first let's take a step back there let's go into the

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.600
 history a little bit let's go for a bot generation loss let me pull up my notes for this one is this

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:44.160
 going to be just from their Wikipedia page but is this also going to be a personal no it's not a

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:51.680
 personal journey okay uh excited this I decided to try to explain this a bit because I was trying

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:59.280
 to explain it to my cousin because I told him like the new generation loss mark two is up I told

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:04.000
 him I got one I was like you'd probably be interested in this because he likes to lo-fi stuff right this

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.840
 is the aforementioned Cyrus or side that we were talking about in the previous episode he's gonna

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:13.360
 be a recurring character and he hopped on reverb and he started sending me links to older versions

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:18.000
 and he was like this is it and it's not that expensive I was like no that's the wrong version

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.480
 and he was like it says version two I said correct that's the wrong version two yeah and he's like

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:28.960
 what the fuck are you talking about so I had explained to him because it can be confusing yeah it is

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:35.520
 overall there are four different iterations of the generation loss petal it started out as

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:41.840
 a Cooper effects petal it was just Cooper effects generation loss that was version one

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.960
 then they paired up wait real quick what year was that like how far back are we going I didn't do

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:53.040
 time frames is it roughly the 80s all no no no yeah this was all roughly over like the last decade

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:59.520
 yeah like probably 10 years ago got you know so yeah Cooper effects made generation loss

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:07.120
 it was more or less what you see here you know minus dips to witches and all that jazz so

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:14.320
 generation loss was successful so chase bliss hit them up and they're like let's do a collaboration

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:19.120
 we'll do a version of this petal we'll add some dip switches we'll add some other options

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:25.440
 that was just called the chase bliss slash Cooper effects generation loss

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:32.400
 but you can think of that as like mark two right that makes that a version two right right right

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:40.880
 so that was the big one for a while like that was the one that I had um it was super rare

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:48.800
 hard to get price was like insane on reverb like some of them were selling for two grand yeah

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:54.720
 holy shit yeah i'll get to that later but yeah it was like unobtainium for a while

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:59.920
 so then Cooper effects side he was going to do a follow up to the original

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:07.360
 and this was the Cooper effects generation loss version two but in actuality you can consider

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:14.240
 this version three so there's kind of like a uh fast and furious right thing going on here

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.960
 they're not actually in order right so you have to be a fan you know to understand the actual

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.720
 order oh wait do we want to segue into me talking about fast and furious for half hour

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:27.920
 i can do that all right we'll we'll table that for now it's like family dave

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:39.760
 um so yeah he created a sequel to the solo version and then Cooper effects cease to exist

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:45.200
 he put that out that was like the last puddle Cooper effects released there wasn't too many of them

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:55.280
 um and he just said i'm no longer releasing stuff i'm done and he instead got hired by chase bliss

00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:04.000
 so he now is an engineer for chase bliss to the best of my knowledge yeah and understanding

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:11.760
 lo and behold this is now the sequel to the collab which can't really consider it a collaboration

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:17.120
 this is four because he's been assimilated into chase right so yes this is version four that is

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:22.880
 sitting in front of me just came out uh last week started shipping this is from the first badge

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.600
 uh super excited to have real quick it's just chase bliss at this point there's just

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:33.280
 chase bliss not right okay no cooper on this name because he is in the fold of chase bliss

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.640
 parts of yeah gotcha that is very confusing and they finally made a fucking stereo pedal they

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:44.080
 made it fucking stereo yes um oddly enough when i was talking about like looking at reverbs and

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:53.440
 shit the chase bliss dark world mhm super fucking appealing to me i was like this is like the perfect

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:57.840
 reverb pedal that i've been looking for it's you can run two different reverbs in parallel

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:02.480
 and they're meant to be like on the darker side oh yeah and you can adjust like the serial

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:08.880
 parallel processing of it and all that shit fucking amazing looking little pedal only in mono right

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:15.920
 and i was like fuck you like so i'm hoping because they did this new generation loss in stereo that

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:20.320
 means we'll have more stereo pedals in the future that would be great because i don't buy any of

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:25.360
 theirs because they're mono right yeah i would love a stereo dark world so if anyone out there

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:30.240
 is listening that is affiliated with chase bliss at all make that your next thing please i think

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:36.400
 it would also rings fucking hotcakes yeah or even yet make them make a module of it but that might

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:40.880
 be asking too much if you're gonna stick to the pedal format please do more stereo shoot for the

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:46.080
 sky Greg you're asking for things like start high bit high so real quick before we get too much

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:51.440
 further than this yes yes um this is a unique effect can you explain to our listeners who may

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.760
 not be familiar with it what does it do because it's probably doesn't fall into a lot like aegorys

00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:05.360
 that are easily described yeah chase bliss describes it as a study of tape in all its forms

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:14.160
 that checks out yeah i describe it as boards of canada in a box both of those check out yeah

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:24.640
 yeah it's meant to emulate that lo-fi vibe of tape degradation not necessarily just saturation

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:29.840
 although that's a part of it but the sounds you get like when you record upon a recording upon a

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:37.520
 recording you know i mean the that and you know also the the flutter and the hiss and the noise and

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:43.680
 all that jazz um but there's but to be clear unlike something like a space echo there's no tape in

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:49.360
 this there's no physical tape there's no tape in this there's no delay in this it's not a tape

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:54.960
 delay which is usually what you go to commonly if you're trying to achieve that or a tape deck

00:54:54.960 --> 00:55:00.320
 you know or something but yeah but this is all emulation of tape without tape yes and primarily

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:06.400
 it was meant to emulate vhs okay like all four versions were kind of aimed at that like

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:13.200
 the previous versions there was only one tape model that it worked with you know i mean it was just

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:19.120
 you just had one vibe and you could adjust the filtering you could adjust the hiss things like

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:24.480
 that the the warble but it was all like one model that it was emulating this is the first one that

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:32.400
 adds a model knob that you can scroll through tons of different emulations that's cool that is cool

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:36.880
 and i can read them off to you because i have the nice little manual here that is of the beautiful

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:44.000
 box like the design of this whole thing is fucking amazing manual oh it's nice dude it's got all these

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:51.520
 old that is you gotta pin too didn't you want to now a sweet little pin so they do a condensed

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:59.200
 version of the models i'll run through that first so there's 12 in total well actually 13 because

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:04.640
 there's an off mode which just puts you in what's called classic mode which is the same as the previous

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:10.800
 versions oh okay so you can dip into classic mode and when you're in classic mode the failure

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:16.320
 knob becomes the high pass the model knob becomes the low pass right on the this is like a parasite

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:21.280
 you got that clouds mode yeah yeah there there is some hidden shit in here too depending on like

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:26.640
 if you hold down both not yeah i won't dip in all that shit oh wow but it can get deep and then on

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.480
 top of that you have all the dip switches right right but holy oh so you're talking about hidden

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:36.000
 modes outside of just the dips which dominates yes yes modes are pretty big for a puddle yeah this

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:42.080
 is it's also really enticing like just as its own little mystery yeah yeah i i mean i loved the

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:50.160
 previous one but i had like extreme i don't want to say buyers remorse because i didn't regret buying

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:56.560
 it i loved it it's probably was my favorite petal ever but like i paid a premium to get it right when

00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.800
 i did purchase it because like i said it was like impossible to get right and like knowing that i

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:07.120
 paid that much for a petal just always kind of wait on me it puts a different pressure on you yeah

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:12.480
 for just a one trick type of effect that i wasn't using in my recording all that much i just love

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:18.320
 to play with it right right you know i i think i spent like a grand on that petal which was like

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:23.920
 nearly three times the retail and i was like yeesh and that was the cheapest one on reverb for weeks

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:31.040
 like all the other ones were around 13 15 1800 and shit so there's almost like a like a cult

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:37.760
 following around this petal absolutely okay yeah um in fact like ever since the chase was version

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:43.280
 they just sell out before they're even like you know available like we'll find them at retailers

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:47.920
 because they're just gone immediately directly so real quick i mean we talked before the recording

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:55.360
 about how as a synthesizer tool this is ideal do people use this with guitars is this big with

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.920
 like indie rockers and i don't know i don't pay attention to the guitar okay i don't know if the

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.960
 edit enough that was like who was driving up the price of this well yeah i mean it was

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:11.920
 i think they finally understand their market with this petal you know like yeah it was for

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.840
 guitarists and guitarists definitely used it most of the demos you have find on youtube are

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:23.120
 guitarist but with the chase bliss collaboration version mark two i'll say or version two like it

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:28.720
 started to get scooped up by synth people gotcha gotcha you know who were trying to do that low

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:36.480
 five vibe in fact they even collaborated with i think like um his name Andrew Huang blank MS

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:44.320
 i think his name wait blank mass from like sacred bones blank four dot ms

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:51.840
 he's the dude that does like all the low five vibe stuff on there also amulets there was a

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:57.120
 model designed by amulets there was a model designed by marcus fissure so it would be keep

00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:07.440
 yeah it would be easy model um yeezy model oh no so yeah like i i loved the petal but like the

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:12.320
 price weighed on me too much eventually i sold it for what i paid for it made my money back and i

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:19.760
 always in the back of my mind i was like if i could ever get one again for a reasonable price i would

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:27.360
 jump on it and i was able to do it with this so like super excited um so wait i distracted you

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:32.400
 yeah tremendously um you were about to read off the different models the different the the

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:38.160
 short version of it is models one through three are vhs emulations models four through five porta

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:46.240
 studio uh model six camcorder model seven through eight diktaphone model nine toy

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:53.600
 model nine or model ten wachman model 11 is just called broken and then model 12 real to real

00:59:53.600 --> 01:00:01.440
 and they give more in-depth explanations as to the these like model one for example is a cpr

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:10.080
 dash 3300 gen one type vhs tape wow that's very specific yeah um model four for example is a porta

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:20.480
 max rt cassette tape uh model nine fishy dash 60 cassette you know like just all this weird shit

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:25.280
 man so even before we've heard any of this that level of detail and that level of sort of just

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:33.600
 nerd deep dive yes is incredibly awesome i agree yeah yeah because like i i just love

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:40.960
 lo-fi saturated you know textures yeah you know and i you said for some of the primaetia

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:46.640
 shit i used to try to do the like record the vhs thing i never was able to create really great

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.760
 results with it probably because i was using uh like a clean tape right i learned over time that

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.000
 like you kind of need a fucked up tape you need to go like full william bizinski like disintegration

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.400
 tapes the ones i've had in my attic for 11 years now that have gone through drastic temperature

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:05.600
 changes that is what yeah so like back when i was doing like the prima this up there wasn't

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.240
 that much information out there about it it's just like a vague post here and there like some

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:15.120
 people saying oh yeah i record shit the vhs over and over and that makes a neat saturation you know

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.440
 and i have you know fuck around with that there's a lot more information out there now about like

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.800
 lo-fi recording and saturation and how to do degraded sounds um and yeah one of the things is

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:31.040
 like leave your tape and the sun or go through some temperature championship like that that i

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:36.720
 didn't know so like my results always varied it was kind of shitty um i would even record shit to my

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:41.840
 how about it's not a walkman but i guess it could be but there is a difference between cassette

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.960
 tapes and vhs tapes as far as even just the mechanism for extracting data from them right i like all

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.960
 of it right yeah that's what i'm saying and that's why this pedal so appealing me now is like it's

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:56.800
 trying to encompass all of it which is amazing yeah yeah oh yeah yeah i mean aside from the

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:06.000
 the new model select um it also has a dedicated saturate knob which works differently poor

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.720
 per model yeah like on the classic mode that was more of like a sample reduction

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.720
 which was kind of cool i always kept it around like 12 percent you know i mean but now like it's a

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.920
 bonafide like saturation depending on the model and i fucking love it already so something's already

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:28.480
 blowing my mind the model is a knob that you can just sort of like sweep through all those different

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.480
 models that's not what i was expecting honestly i thought the model was going to be driven by the

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.280
 dip switches in the back it can be fucking with the switches you can adjust what's called the ramp

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.640
 which is an on board lfo that you can assign to that knob and have it shift through models

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:48.400
 it's one of those ones on the box because it's like kind of a waveform yeah and i'm guessing

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:54.400
 that's how you assign the cv input i haven't even looked into the cv capabilities of it or like the

01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:02.560
 the fucking the yeah the like the pedal i don't know what that can do yet um i had sort of coming

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:07.920
 into this recording like a little bit of a preconception of like what generation loss was and this

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:13.280
 is like 10 times more than that um and you haven't even gone through all the six knobs yet or the

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:20.320
 switches so what's everything do here yeah so like most of it is the same that you'll find on the

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:25.680
 previous models like you have your auxiliary mode which just assigns what happens when you push

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.760
 to soxillary switch you can have it do like tape stops you can have it oh that's cool yeah

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:37.120
 you can have it max out the failure knob up here like so you can have that low on the head and

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:43.760
 it'll just like blast it to max you know i mean so it'll just be full on failure mode um and you can

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:49.440
 have it just kind of bypass all the facts it's just called filter mode where it'll just be like clean

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:55.040
 it'll still be going through the processor but like you're not getting the tape effect yeah

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.200
 yeah you're just getting the filter effect yeah the second knob it's just called the dry knob you

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:05.280
 adjust how much of dry signal you want to come through so you can have it none or because there's

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:11.760
 no wet dry knob right so this is so if you turn dry all the way off you're just getting like weird

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.200
 tape noise yeah kind of like looping delay or you can like feed the delay yeah yeah or you can have

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:23.520
 it at like unity gain so at that point all the tape stuff is kind of like functioning as like a

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:30.800
 chorus you know yeah it's neat and that's especially neat because this one has the stereo and one of

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.960
 the dip switches in the back can make it do different things in stereo basically you can have left

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:42.720
 right channels being processed by the tape shit differently so you go like the left is kind of

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.880
 warbling different than the right you got different amounts of like hiss between your left and your

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.840
 right so real quick how do you set that up like what you described sounds amazingly powerful yeah

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:57.360
 i'm a little confused how you do that with this uh these dip switches back here okay ones that are

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:04.720
 in dark blue they're if you flip it upside down says customized yeah yeah so that adjusts different

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:11.760
 characteristics of this stuff so to the viewers i'm looking at like probably 15 dips 15 16 dip switches

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:18.560
 on the back here what's c usb 4 i have no idea what the usb is for maybe they're gonna offer like

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:23.200
 firmware updates in the future or something like none of the previous versions had a usb port that

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:29.200
 i'm that i can recall so i have no idea it is one of the sexiest pieces of gear i've ever seen

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:35.840
 yeah this is wild dude like when i had the previous one like even if i didn't know how much i had paid

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:40.880
 for it like holding it in my hand i was just like this is an awesome piece of gear you know i mean

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.760
 this one even more so and oh but you're saying the dip switches like that's how you can figure

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:52.560
 the other thing you can figure out this which is like for example this one hum bypass there's like

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:59.200
 a hum that is built into the failure oh wow you can you can bypass it you know i mean like the more

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:05.600
 you turn it up the more like you get with that um there's also drop bypass like it can do things

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.880
 where the audio just kind of drops out for like you know at random you can bypass that i usually

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:16.160
 bypass that i feel like that's too much having it just cut out right randomly personally um

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:26.160
 but yeah so you got your flutter your wow which is a staple on oh i'm sorry there was one more knob

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.200
 or switch rather and that's the noise switch you have none mild and heavy and that just brings in

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:40.080
 the tape hiss noise like that um it's a lot of variation you can yeah there's all those models

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:47.920
 which is like that's a lot and like i was saying some of the parameters defer per model to like the

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:54.480
 the saturation for example will be different styles of tape saturation or degradation depending on

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:59.440
 the model you said and i know you've only had this for 48 hours you said but it's responsive to you

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:04.720
 jamming on these knobs like going to town on these knobs like it's it's up to everything's real time came

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:10.320
 up last night kind of playing around with it like my personal favorite thing to do with it was just

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:18.640
 to always run not not necessarily pads but atmospheric texture you know and in the fact that you can

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:25.440
 do that in stereo now i think is yeah phenomenal yeah clearly they're not just catering to guitar

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:31.120
 players anymore like they know that people that have since want to play with this thing um

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:38.240
 so how did you get that were you early on the pre-orders i was not i missed out on the pre-order

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.680
 as did a lot of people most people that tried to do the pre-order um it sold out within 10 minutes

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:48.960
 and like a lot of people were in the paypal check out and then all of a sudden bloop none

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:58.000
 available oh shit yeah i got very fortunate i saw a gentleman on mod wiggler post up that he

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:05.760
 was backing out of his pre-order i caught him within like a few minutes of posting it and i was

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:10.880
 like hey i will gladly take that off your hands um i would have even paid slightly more than retail

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:16.240
 but he was literally just asking retail like four hundred bucks what he paid for it and i was like

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:21.200
 i was like you're a fucking dude man yeah there's like awesome she's sending up some stickers i'm

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:25.920
 cozy i've been so bad at that too i haven't seen that i should send a sticker so i've

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:30.560
 so much shit over the last two three months because i was just kind of like cycling what i

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:36.240
 wanted in my rig and i forgot to include anything extra and i feel like an asshole same here i had

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:42.400
 a 50 success rate of remembering to do that it's better than us yeah so i got rid of like 10 stickers

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.680
 that way so anyone had purchased something off me recently i apologize i will mail you stickers

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:51.200
 if you want stickers yeah remember i can cram into an envelope tasteful nudes

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:57.920
 yes tasteful news um no panties but yeah and i was nervous about doing that i've never purchased

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.480
 a pre-order from someone before yeah and i'm like so how does this work can you use any said like

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:07.920
 chase bliss is really good at like changing the information on the order right right and he sent

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.880
 me screenshots he was like here's me requesting them to change the pre-order to your address he's

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.960
 like any email notifications will still come to me but i'll relay them to you so this is like the

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:22.160
 first time you bought a video game entirely digital you're like i don't have a CD i don't have a booklet

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:27.680
 like what's this scene exactly like that you're just like your mind is blown at technologies

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:32.880
 advancement into the digital realm yeah it was it's kind of nebulous you know i mean yeah i

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:39.280
 purchased nothing but other than someone's word that they will write have this go to you give you

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:45.200
 their place in a virtual line yeah it's a really weird thing to sell but yeah um but yeah i went

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:51.760
 for it yeah paid off took the leap yeah and it was within the first batch so these are

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:57.680
 onobtanium right now there's a few that are already up on reverb like most people received them

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.920
 the same day as i did which was two days ago there's a few on reverb right now that are going for

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:07.840
 around seven hundred dollars which is like flipper price yeah almost double than retail yeah absolutely

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.720
 there's no one just selling it for retail right now right everyone's trying to flip right um which

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.040
 is unfortunate because that just goes to show that there are a lot of people clogging up those

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.520
 pre-orders whose sole intention is just a fucking flip so we were talking about last

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.200
 i was gonna say we already reeled against them the same thing's happening with the score up

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.400
 the hatbacks too everyone up there is like four to six hundred dollars over retail price and it's

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.360
 like which is a bummer solid guys yeah this is a huge bummer because maybe not for like two to six

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.160
 hundred there are definitely people out there that this is like a game changer for their setup

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:46.560
 it's unique yeah yeah but it's okay i think at this point it like if you want one you can get one

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.440
 at retail you're just gonna have to really pay attention to when the pre-orders open up again

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.920
 you know i mean and get involved in those badges because it's not like a limited run

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:00.560
 it's it's just that there's a lot of demand and you got a lot of these flippers that are scooping

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.280
 them out so you got to kind of compete so to deviate once again i'm sorry i've been nothing but a

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.280
 distraction this whole time but um more fired up about this than i thought it was going to be

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.480
 you said you've been experimenting with it for the last couple of nights what have you been

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.360
 doing with it only last night um i was just running basic shit through just trying to compare it to

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:24.080
 the classic mode originally i was trying to dial in uh the classic mode they say it's the same as

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.840
 classic mode but i think because it's in stereo it sounded a little different to my ears and so did the

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:38.960
 the filter i i'm curious if i could get any specifics somewhere online i haven't found any but i

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:44.480
 feel like the filter is different one of my favorite things about the previous chase bliss version

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:51.920
 was the filter um it was just very uh i don't know i don't know it was just perfect to me like

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.880
 for what it was meant to do it was a perfect filter yeah this one doesn't sound quite as resonant

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:04.240
 i think i haven't dipped too much into it i think in the hidden modes i can adjust the filter maybe

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.200
 you went over the six knobs and none of them were filter cut off or resonant that only value

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.160
 yeah that only exists in classic mode gosh okay the failure knob becomes high pass again

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:21.280
 and this model mode comes low pass again if you look underneath the text you'll see lphb oh yeah yeah

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:26.000
 that signifies what is available in classic mode gosh when the model mode is off meaning all

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:33.200
 the way counterclockwise so it's like a fixed resonance level yes and i always liked where it was like

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.760
 it was pretty resonant definitely not transparent filter you know in the previous version it was

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:44.320
 pretty upfront upfront yeah but i loved it yeah like there was sometimes where i'd run things through

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:50.640
 it and just use it as a filter more or less and you know just to add a little bit of hiss and

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.880
 filtering and real subtle and that was nice um filter does sound a little different to me so real

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:05.040
 quick there's a switch that's between the two um stomp presets oh there's presets yeah do you set

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.600
 them or do they come on board okay how do you set how do you make a preset i forget because i never

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:14.640
 really did it but it's available it is you've had a concept of what the presets are yeah i mean the

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:20.240
 the controls were so basic on the previous versions i never really felt the need to save anything i

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.560
 would just feel it out dial it in you know but now because you have so many different options and

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:33.520
 models i can definitely see utilizing the preset system more that usb is midi oh is it oh this is

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:40.240
 midi capable on the side i was thinking i don't fuck with no midi yeah more interested in the tv

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.800
 input that's weird though because this is also a midi input oh maybe that is the midi maybe the

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:53.840
 u_s_ piece oh it's weird wait there's a separate quarter inch midi yeah midi and ox oh fucking hell

01:13:53.840 --> 01:14:01.680
 this is a this is a monster it's really blown away very impressive and you're um i mean they've

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.560
 made a lot of them already they're eight yeah yeah no said i don't know the number here but you're

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:12.640
 you're in the 800s here yeah that's the thing like i think they plan on making a lot of these so

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.000
 the other ones were kind of limited because i guess they i don't think they ever expected them

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.880
 to become as popular as they did you know and like there's a difference between like

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:27.920
 manufactured scarcity and oh shit we made what we thought was gonna be enough and turned out to

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:32.560
 not be enough that's a huge spectrum there yeah it seems like they're trying to keep up with orders

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:38.880
 this time around which is like they realize they have a a hit right here and they're trying to

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:45.040
 you know accommodate the demand i assume the uh lo-fi beats to study to youtube

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:54.800
 uh scene is about to explode yes and giving them i don't necessarily expect you to do that

01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.080
 how do you typically use this oh yeah you did ask me that before sorry i got sidetracked i

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:04.400
 probably by me because i've been asking a lot of questions mainly background textures okay you

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:11.920
 know i mean like i and and just to process drums through like i love the sound when it gets a little

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:19.840
 dirty and degraded you know beyond just distortion like it's so easy to turn drums into

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:26.240
 gabber you know when you're applying distortions but you mean the perfect form right go on but like

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.480
 you know that's not what i'm always looking for or even if i am looking for sometimes i want to add

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:33.600
 extra characters right to the gabber kit you know i mean like i want to add

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.840
 especially with digital sounds like fm drums they can be so in your fucking face you know but

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:45.520
 once you start applying like tape saturation and degradation sounds and pitch warbles and

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:52.640
 hisses and shit like that it starts to make things that you can gel with other sounds easier you know

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:57.120
 right because a lot of that distortion for like a like a gabber like a classic gabber kick it's

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:04.000
 full spectrum it's take it's it's upfront it's sort of man spreading across your frequency spectrum

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.040
 like to have something that kind of goes like you still have that gabber kick but it's actually

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.440
 kind of like playing nicely with others right i like to bury sounds in the mix you know i mean i

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:21.760
 always have like i i'm not one to allow space often in my mixes you know which i'm sure it's been a

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.640
 nightmare for all the people that have mastered your tracks over the years yeah like i like to have

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:33.680
 things buried and like one of the most ear pleasing ways the bury sounds is tape

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:38.480
 degradation style sound you know i mean either through real tape or emulation like this

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:46.000
 hmm and also when it comes to atmospheric's same situation i like to be able to create texture

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.640
 that's one of the kind of why i like granulizing things so much too because you can create like a

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:57.920
 nice texture out of something that was a you know a stable sound now is like got more texture to it

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:03.120
 for lack of a better term and that's why i like my shitty reverbs same situation it's all the same

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:11.760
 situation i like to make shit dirty and kind of like able to fit in the background and fill the

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:18.880
 spaces you know like nicely and this is just another method of achieving that in my opinion you know and

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.920
 it's especially good when you combine it with like a shitty reverb right you know i mean things like

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:30.800
 that um so wait as a uh self-proclaimed dirty boy mmm can you imagine getting more of these

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.880
 i know i mean obviously this is probably something you're not going to get rid of anytime soon do you

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:40.400
 see a use out of having multiples of them not necessarily okay like i kind of it's type of thing

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:47.440
 where like you just you know one track it out fair enough just me yeah yeah yeah go through it and

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.720
 then you're done um it's not the type of thing where i really need to have like multiples of to

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.240
 have like you don't want more hands-on control or like i'm not going to be performing with like

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.880
 running everything through it's not a thing that i would record something through similar to tape

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.640
 you know i mean i use it just like a reel to reel except without all the hassles of

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.400
 fucking around with a reel to reel just bounce out the the sub mix through it

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:16.480
 add some texture dial it in the taste base and someone with a reel to reel that they rarely use

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:21.920
 because of what a pan the acid is right it's cool like using it is amazing but

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:28.080
 um it's definitely easier than a vhs to like yeah it's really both of those are really inconvenient

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:34.240
 mediums there really are and this makes it way more convenient and there's a lot of shit out there

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:39.360
 that i mean the concept isn't new right right i i think ever since like the first boards of

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:46.560
 canada album there's been a cult following of people trying to emulate that type of sound

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:55.440
 degradation through plugins petals other gear um most of it doesn't nail it though right you know

01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:00.960
 i mean i've always felt like this kind of does um i don't know how they did it well you have that

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.560
 book to read it is a wonderful little manual i'm super happy it came with it it's also substantial

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:12.000
 i mean there's a lot of data in there they're not fucking around no i mean it goes into like

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.920
 you know like just discussing like models and all that shit like for someone who like might be

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:24.880
 completely new right to like the concept so greg yeah so you're so ultimately you are a fan of this

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:31.840
 battle i am this is i feel like it's the complete version of it i can't think of anything else that

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:37.760
 they could do to add to it at this point might i mean from the start i was always wanting stereo

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:45.920
 right and now it's there yeah um and i didn't ask for it but i'm glad it exists the saturate circuit

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:50.080
 is fucking phenomenal oh nice i'm having a lot of fun messing with that yesterday in fact i can see

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:57.360
 myself using this just as a saturation pedal from time to time though um there's a neat little tidbit

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:02.880
 in the manual about the saturation it says the saturate and the model are interactive

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:08.400
 the tape models come after saturation in the signal flow molding and filtering the distortion

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.920
 so each model will exaggerate certain parts of the saturation while suppressing others

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:18.560
 because that's kind of cool in the flow so it's kind of like you're over driving the inputs of a tape deck

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:26.400
 which is pretty awesome yeah pretty cool and they use a term that i have i'm not familiar with

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.560
 and i thought i knew a lot about distortion saturation but they say the type of saturation

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:37.840
 that occurs on a you know tape recorder is called magnetic hysteresis loop

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:46.480
 hmm it it's the magnetic structure of the tape and essentially shifts and alters any future sounds

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:52.160
 that are recorded and you don't have to actually fuck with tape which is right as we established

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:58.160
 a pain in the ass yeah yum is it a hundred percent accurate fuck no yeah but it comes pretty damn close

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:03.280
 yeah it's pretty convenient seems like it has its own thing going on too that always goes a long

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:07.760
 way too like being able to change those modes in real time and shit that's pretty cool yes the

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:12.240
 type of fact that goes beyond just being in effect it's it becomes an instrument you know and that's

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:17.200
 how i thought about the previous one and this one even way more so right with all the different

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.760
 models and such but i mean i think making a good point though it's now more than the sum

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:27.040
 of its constituent modes being able to sweep between them and integrate those and have them

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:34.720
 mixed between them um like you know trying to set up 12 DCRs and real to real and tape right and

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:42.960
 trying to do what this is doing in that battle talking a tape and a toilet yes i mean not say

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:48.160
 couldn't be done right it's just impractical yeah this is a better solution for that big fan of it

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.480
 super happy to have them looking forward to spending more quality time with it yeah

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:59.600
 yeah very nice what about you what's next on your uh so my my big thing it's not even that big

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:06.400
 because it's a quality of life improvement trade or where i'm going with this um i pre-ordered the

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:15.280
 deluge ole update yep you upgrade um i've talked about this forever i clearly stand for uh deluge

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:23.920
 all the time um but the display is garbage like it's commonly bad it's for four characters yeah

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:29.520
 like eight segment four characters right yeah it's um and you know it's scrolls if it's more than

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:36.720
 that but like i've like i now accommodate the four characters by like all of my everything i save

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:43.520
 is four characters um it always worked um especially when i was like okay cool i'll just make everything

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:49.760
 four characters long it's a pretty huge limitation like going to a parameter and just getting like

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:54.000
 here's the parameter and it spits out a four character representation of it and then the value

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.080
 was never ideal um it's it's a very hard way to work and i think they even originally said at the

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:04.480
 outset like they wanted you to not look at screens when they made it which is why they even did the

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.360
 clever stuff like waveform display on the pads and like all those brilliant workarounds but even

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:16.240
 in this new update yeah the sort of um dovetail off of that they said that the deluge has gone way

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:20.800
 beyond what they intended it for but you know like that first version like what they've first

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:27.280
 envisioned for it is not what they have now it's evolved in this way that is just um totally different

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:33.040
 and they still have fundamental principles this is like how they want it to be used and you know

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:40.400
 those haven't changed but you know basically it the four character display started to become a

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:46.000
 limitation and you certainly don't have to do it um but they have to do this upgrade because

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.480
 apparently it's more complicated and it makes it like send it in i have to send it in yeah

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:55.920
 just wondering how that would work i was like wow you just swap it out or what but i wish i could

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:01.760
 just do it myself um sure but they're not offering that as a thing and it makes sense because it's

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:06.240
 gonna be a lot of people that fuck it up you know break their deluge and then they've got another

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:10.320
 nightmare right trying to fix it so like electron every did the plus drive when you could like

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.120
 upgrade those things right like they'd ship it back and yeah and i honestly i think this is a good

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:20.160
 time to do it not like i'm getting a lot of shows but like summers over realistically shows are

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:25.440
 just going to start dwindling fucking spend your winter maybe a week or two without it um and

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:31.520
 they even said they're going to try to um minimize just how long it's away like you know like they're

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:36.960
 gonna let you know pack it up get ready you send that off and they send it back as fast as possible

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:43.760
 and you don't have to do it there's basically like like forked firmware with ole ole d and without

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:49.040
 functionality is basically unchanged but now whenever you get to go to a parameter

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:56.640
 um it's sort of in bold at the top of this ole d values either scroll um kind of like what you had

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:02.400
 already but you can actually fucking read the entire thing um or if it's something with a numeric

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:07.520
 parameter you get a little bar that shows you the value yeah if you can afford it and you can afford

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:13.600
 to have it away for a you know a week or two um it makes total sense um also everything they're

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:19.360
 making from here on out will just include it already like it's part of the the base model now

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:24.000
 which is every couple of months just raises more in price yeah which is cool that they were super

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.040
 transparent about that absolutely here's our plan for price raises over time and they explained

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:34.960
 they've been very forthcoming about why they had to do it um and also i'm glad i got mine when i

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:40.240
 did but you know um it would be very hard to justify getting one now just because we're not

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:45.520
 justified they're a lot pricier they're really they're pretty expensive now um are they yeah

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:50.160
 yeah like just from them i think it's like twelve or thirteen hundred bucks whoa yeah okay yeah and

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:55.680
 i got mine for like seven hundred and say one day between six to eight yeah they were really cheap

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:58.720
 if you were like eight new and now they're going to be like fifteen hundred new

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.280
 or something like that really should it's all but it does a lot more now to like kind to get it

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.840
 yeah the cost of everything so much respect for them even doing a retrofit not just being like

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.800
 here's a mark two like buy the new one if you want it absolutely uh a hundred percent of grade like

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:17.600
 it because that's not easy to figure out itself no and they even had when they when they tried to

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.640
 do the first sort of offering of it the website crashed like basically there was a lot they didn't

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:28.640
 expect yeah they didn't just did not expect that like there was a flood of people trying to get

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.600
 this this work done they and they went back and said yeah we fucked up i'm sorry came up with a

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:40.080
 new approach for it that worked you know if you if you um pre-order by the state you're in line

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.240
 you got to guarantee we'll figure it out from there so you know the fact that they did this

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:51.120
 fucked it up immediately corrected it i mean that's yeah i i've nothing but love for us and

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:58.720
 synth strum and uh what they do yeah cool so that's that's my big thing and i will be more excited to

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:04.720
 show everyone when uh when i get this done jerryty send it in no no i just did the pre-order the um

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:10.320
 okay it's starting in november um and i think it's probably first come first serve but basically

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.920
 they'll email you hey you're up you're up the bat get your shit ready send it on the state

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:22.000
 um and hopefully in by then too i i don't i don't think i was one of the early ones so

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.680
 um by the time they come to me i assume they will even refine the process even more yeah

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.040
 that's awesome yeah i'm very stuck again this is like the um the centerpiece of everything i do

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:41.200
 every every time every time because starts begins and at like even in the studio not just live stuff

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:49.920
 yeah absolutely i mean because it's got midi and cv and samples its own synths engine like i

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:56.000
 now think in those terms when i start right it's cool because i remember when you were going to buy

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.560
 one that was kind of your goal if you wanted something to kind of be the heart of your setup

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.040
 i didn't realize you achieved it with i thought it was more like something you used for live stuff

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.920
 than realize like in the studio i do that as well yeah i mean there's a separate set of lives

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:16.160
 setups um live presets set up in just a different workflow yeah that works for live but also at home

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:22.400
 completely different and can switch his context to track making and composition

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:29.840
 seamlessly all in the same box yeah yeah with the exception of the sound generation reminds me a

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:37.520
 lot of the square pat backs um which i just finally got to after waiting for half of a year yeah um

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.560
 so we the the delay was supply chain or was there something else it caused supply chain okay yeah

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:46.960
 because i ordered it in like april and even at that time they were like this is the june batch

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:51.760
 and then june rolled around and they were like end of july and then something actually with the

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.160
 panels like they had an issue they came back with defects and they were like no we're gonna like

01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:02.240
 redo these panels and it's going to be september and i got mine like right at the top of september

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:09.440
 and it is a god tier greatest sequencer i've ever used um yeah i couldn't it's the same way you're

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:14.480
 talking about the deluge like it's the center of sequencing for me now and like i can't imagine

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:20.960
 that ever changing um you've been a fan of some of the other squirps open the past i had three pyramids

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:26.640
 at one point i had two just to have a backup for a live show i was playing and um even the last

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:30.960
 time i sold it i was using the west like performer a lot more and that's kind of why i sold it but

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:36.400
 always missed some of the immediacy of the pyramid and some of the effects and things it can do and

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:42.400
 it's like having the half-axis like them fixing every problem i could have ever had with the pyramid

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:48.960
 adding a ton more stuff adding beautiful like isomorphic keyboard grids um it's made me realize like i

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:54.560
 love isomorphic keyboards so this is a fundamentally different product this isn't just like a mark two

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.640
 of the pyramid this is a fundamentally different product it's fundamentally different the pyramid

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:04.320
 just had like kind of two um sets of eight steps you could use as a keyboard it was really elegant

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:09.920
 it was nice again has no velocity on any of the pads which is actually just fine um this has like

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:16.720
 i forget how many but eight by sixteen or twelve by sixteen button grid very similar in size to the

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:24.000
 deluge actually um so it's that nice full thing you can see by color like every midi note like it's

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.240
 yeah it's the nicest thing i've ever had for sequencing by a long shot and it's midi and cv like what

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:37.760
 are all the ins and outs um it's got one it's two midi ins one of them small eight-inch format and

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:42.640
 you can toggle air b type by software which is awesome and more people should do it's got like

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:51.600
 three midi outs or four and then another eight-inch midi out um damn it's got six cv gate outs i think

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:57.600
 a couple pairs of those um you know my friend luke has tested it a lot more than i have but the

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:03.200
 timing on it is like ridiculous it's like microseconds delay like if you use the usb one of the

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:09.680
 cool things is it has usb device and usb host support so the really cool thing that i've done

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:15.440
 and a lot of people have done um is hooking it up to the expert sleepers fh2 midi to cv interface

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:21.600
 because it's like microseconds latency from the device to the thing the timing is the best midi

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:27.520
 timing um never really ever seen on the device that wasn't just generating midi from audio pulses

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:34.000
 so it's like incredibly tight um there's actually a bug with it right now that we're kind of working

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.640
 with squar upon because the connection to the midi interface will drop notes sometimes even though

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:44.160
 like you can do it over ableton and it's actually because of how high speed it is it causes problems

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:48.720
 like there's even a setting this also has a web interface like you were mentioning before to like

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:54.000
 set up this fh2 i know it's shifted to the fh2 a little bit here but it's like tangential to the

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.120
 subject um and you can turn off something that it will auto interrupt gates because it will send a

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:03.920
 gate through this thing so quickly that it won't turn it off in time and you'll get like hung and

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:09.120
 stuck notes because it's like um even if you run it through a midi interface which is my work around

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:14.080
 now is running it through the din midi expansion that i built it adds one millisecond of latency

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:19.600
 which is enough time for it to catch up and not have that thing hung up um so they've got to maybe

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.560
 make an osu software update to the haphax to account for this uh but it's awesome because you

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:32.480
 can hook up with one usb cable to this mod interface in my modular fh2 and have like you know 16 like

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:38.560
 cv gate outs that are fucking incredibly tight latency but the killer feature the thing i like

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:44.800
 about it maybe the most is that it has two cv inputs and what the fh2 will do when working with this

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:50.080
 is it will auto calibrate any of your oscillators so you can take like even the shittiest oscillator

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:55.440
 and get like seven or eight octaves of perfect tuning just hit that button calibrate it yeah

01:32:55.440 --> 01:33:01.520
 not have to think about tuning again which like even using the built-in cv gate outs on the haphax

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:06.160
 like and they have a cool setup where you can actually calibrate it like you measure it and you

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:12.400
 can calibrate the haphax first and do it like tuning on cv stuff is a nightmare it changes with heat

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.400
 and this you've still got all that stuff warm up but once you hit that calibrate button and like

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:22.080
 it just plays in perfect pitch it's like magical this discovery was after the what was like a weekend

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.160
 of you calibrating oscillators calibrating oscillators and everything and i knew that this

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:31.200
 was there and i was trying to make it work because i came across that fh2 bug i was like oh i gotta

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:36.000
 figure out this another way and i was like nope i'm going to make this work report the bug to

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.160
 squarp and so did luke also reported the bug to them and they're like they bought an fh2s

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:45.840
 another gonna fix it and work on it like huge props to squarp for that nice um but it's like

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:51.200
 it's so nice when it works and just the oscillator tuning like i you can buy a little breakout from

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:55.360
 thong in a few other places it's like the easiest module build ever it's just putting some eighth

01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:00.720
 inch jacks on there and it connects via pins to the back of the fh2 to send midi in and out

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:05.440
 oh nice um so i actually take the eighth inch midi out of the habaxx directly into the eighth

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:11.040
 inch midi of the fh2 interface and that's like how i'm running my live set for the module or stuff

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:17.440
 and it like it works so well it's it's really nice but back to the habaxx itself it's like

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:23.760
 two squarp pyramids but with that huge button grid so it has the nice feature with the

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:29.840
 pyramid when i built my live set you got 64 tracks and it's actually hierarchies a little

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:35.840
 different on the um habaxx but on the pyramid you got 64 tracks you could assign them to any

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:40.160
 midi channel they could be any length basically but that was like what you had to work with and

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:46.240
 that was fine for me because i like needed four channels um for a song basically and i could divide

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:51.840
 up and get like roughly 16 songs out of the thing with the habaxx it's a little different because

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:57.600
 you get 16 rows of eight patterns and that's your project but the cool thing is there's a project

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:03.280
 day and a project B button um so you can have two active projects at the same time and if you

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.240
 unmute the one project it will mute the other one so you just like toggle them that way so you

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.560
 can do it in real time as you're playing yes you can just go forever like just in the middle of a

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:18.800
 sequence with no you it's also has the weirdest thing like it's the fastest turning on device i've

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.960
 ever seen in my life it's like you hit the button and it's like there's no loading screen it's just

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:28.320
 like boop it's ready to go so it's the opposite of the uh therogynous tone structure yes which has a

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:33.760
 blank screen for 10 seconds as you sit there go please just fucking start did i bry it or is it

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:41.600
 going to turn on i knew that feeling the fucking poly and play also a very long boot process oh

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:46.320
 yeah it takes forever to load a project right i was actually like really disappointed with my

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:52.320
 head the the tracker seemed like much faster in that regard i don't know why the play is so dog

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.520
 shit slow yeah yeah loading a project or adding like a sample pack like i guess it's the sample

01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:04.000
 loading process that is so slow but the HAPACS does not have this problem no it's lightning quick in all

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.440
 regards um they've been very good about updates it's just a fucking powerhouse of sequencing like

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:16.560
 i've never and this is standalone right this is not okay yep it's um it's got its own power supply

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:22.560
 it's not usb powered standalone um it's pretty like it's not that bag i would have brought it but

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:27.760
 it's like it's probably like you know big as the t-r-a-s pretty much i mean you already did way more

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:32.480
 show and tell than any of us did for this actually no no correct it i dropped the ball and show

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:37.360
 you brought beer just brought some beers just showing off your pumpkin ale tell us about that

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:44.480
 sounds a shadow that i just told you oh it sounds shadows yes it's uh it's brand new it's the

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:49.440
 three point average this is the three point oh one yeah it's the newest it's a little more slim

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:53.920
 that it doesn't have the vca which is like well you don't need it i didn't need that anyway yeah

01:36:53.920 --> 01:37:01.280
 but yeah HAPACS like super excited like it's already like i'm working on this live set and like

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.640
 having it back and it's like a beast with the virus too like letting myself use a little presets

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:11.520
 again my last vlabset was all drum machines and modular it's been nice to like give myself a

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:16.240
 little break and have some presets and ability to easily recall things are you still using the

01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:21.600
 looper no okay no the looper's out of the mix for now because this makes that so much easier the

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:27.520
 modular is still in the mix with the set too um but man is it fun to like write shit with this i've

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:33.600
 like last set that i used the pyramid for i remember like every i would just after work um spend an

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.920
 hour or two and always make something new every day and this is the same like i can write stuff so

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:43.200
 quickly with this i really um it feels awesome like i used to really like the westic performer that

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.080
 couldn't do polyphonic midi or anything like that and it's with the modular that was fine but this

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:53.280
 is like i doubt i'll use the westic performer again even though it's like an awesome module on its own

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:58.720
 right this is like so nice so you started to mention it but i presumably cut you off on this

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:03.280
 you were talking about having the actual um what is that keyboard representation oh the ice

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.720
 amorphic ice amorphic um can you basically just sit there and play that and record it good question

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:12.640
 because it's got all these modes you can put the pads in too so you can use this ice amorphic

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:16.720
 keyboard it's got like you know there's a live recording mode and then there's a pattern mode

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.480
 where you can switch patterns but in live recording mode you've got like a keyboard you can figure

01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:25.840
 that to some degree you can play like you know cord stuff isomorphic style or you can actually

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:31.680
 if put into a drum mode with a different pads since they're not velocity sensitive you get one um

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:37.040
 midi output but in a chunk of pads and the different pads send different velocities

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:42.000
 which is a really cool way to probe that idea like if they they could maybe add that deluge

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.280
 if you absolutely yeah that would be a good feature um but in this isomorphic mode you just hit like

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:53.360
 the record button on the left and you just play it um it really you know i'm not none of us are like

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:58.720
 keyboard guys per se we've used them when we had to to like make sounds and shit like that too

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:03.440
 test with c sounds like yeah there it is yeah like i explained the isomorphic keyboard to

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:07.920
 step it was just like disgusted but step was like classical piano for many years too it was just

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.560
 like i don't need that all right yeah but i can see these shapes and i know like if i move my hand

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.720
 over here it's gonna actually sound the right way that's still a cord that red button c and i know

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:22.640
 i can go back to that at the end of this thing like so yeah isomorphic works really well for me um

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:28.000
 i really like it plus it's like it's this nice visual thing where there are tracks in this

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.440
 live set where i know like on this first one if it's the first one there's like a sequence up on the

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:38.000
 upper right corner i can play and it's like the blue keys on this thing it really like i'm super

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:43.440
 visual person so the fact that the midi notes are different colors yeah and i can remember these

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:49.280
 locations on this grid with colors like works very well for me that like my brain likes that shit

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:54.160
 and i see the uh you got the manual uh in front of you yeah it looks like there's a lot of buttons so

01:39:54.160 --> 01:40:01.440
 you could have a pretty big spectrum of uh cords and octaves at your disposal there's it fixes like

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:06.000
 also you know a lot of machines copying patterns or duplicating patterns are making them longer as

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.560
 a painly ass this is like the easiest setup i've ever seen for that it's like so nice to

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.360
 copy a pattern over to like do maintenance and move tracks around which was a little bit of a

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:20.320
 bit on the pyramid now it's like really easy for me to restructure everything to make it the

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:24.960
 right way because i'm sloppy or in that like i don't go like well the number two we mean midi

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.960
 channel number two i don't know if that's the right sound yet so i'm just gonna like go fucking

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:33.760
 ham until i get the right thing and try to clean it up after so it lets you do some of that it's

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:38.800
 really easy to edit which is another bitch like on this one of the complaints people have is like

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.400
 you know on the deluge i think you can set note length by just hitting this

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:47.360
 start step and then destination yeah yeah well on the hapex that's how you do selection for

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:52.400
 editing so you can define squares that you then want to manipulate and hit like delete or like

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:58.000
 rotate or do these things which is nice which is cool but yeah i was that would blow my eye

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.240
 set length but you just set length with a knob on this and i'm like okay hit the button you see

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:07.360
 hit the start then use the knob you set the length and you can see it dress cool you know it's like

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:11.440
 and they said they might come up with another way to set length but i'm like oh this is fine and i

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:16.960
 like the ability to select things like that works really well um one thing i would think they could

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:21.920
 add is like the ability to fold a keyboard you know kind of like in ableton where you can be like just

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:26.640
 let me see all the notes that i selected here i don't have to jump octaves up and down but you

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:32.000
 know i had the oxy one and i was on that pre-order for a while and i sold that and that's when i got

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.160
 the squarp pre-order and um i always felt lost on the oxy one like didn't know where the fuck i was

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:41.760
 the screen was really had that for a long time either did you know a couple months you know i

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:47.440
 tried to make it work and just didn't like it this has two screens um which makes it kind of there's

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:52.000
 much more information to see and it's like that editing like i know where i'm at in a sequence on

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.560
 the oxy one i always felt like i was kind of lost and i didn't know where the fuck my notes were

01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:02.480
 that's kind of like the monom problem i had of like this is a contextualist grid which is cool

01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:09.120
 because it can be any context you want even though i know the context i i'm lost in this seat of

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:14.880
 just buttons and yeah but yeah in the in the shitty reality where i could only have one piece of

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:19.840
 gear at all i would want the habax and like a laptop yeah that would be the one thing because

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:25.200
 it's like the most it's really like i'm learning it feels cheesy but like an instrument like it's

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:29.600
 something i'm actually learning to play and developing some skills with again which i had a lot of muscle

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:34.640
 memory at the pyramid so it's nice to like i just really want to invest in this thing and get better

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:39.760
 at it it's super rewarding they fucking killed it it's so good especially for the price was good too

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.960
 i think it was like 900 or something like that which is i mean that sounds like a powerhouse yeah the

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:48.800
 pyramid was always 700 yeah i could have charged more and i still would have been like yeah yeah

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:54.640
 that's expensive but i'll get it i'm so glad i did oh so do you still have your pyramid or both

01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:59.120
 those gone nope yeah they're gone okay yeah the last one i sold like a year ago just because i wasn't

01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:04.400
 didn't there were no live sets on the horizon too and that made me remember like damn this is

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:09.680
 paired with the virus too and you know the virus is like 16 virus ties is but a lot of people don't

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:17.200
 know and it's like really fucking fast to write music they it's awesome oh and the automation it's

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.000
 so sweet the buttons are such a nice height that you can drag like the pyramids had like the touchpad

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.720
 yeah which half of mine broke in the ones i had like it was kind of sketchy but this has like a

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:32.080
 really nice automation screen where you can assign ccs or assign automation to the cv outs it'll smooth

01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:39.920
 the cv outs um so i send all lfo's and automation into this over cv all the time and because it worked

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:45.600
 perfectly and then you can edit that automation after we're no that's nice yeah like and see the

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:51.760
 sequence the note sequence underneath it overlaid so like i'm will be using this live and editing

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:56.480
 automation live for sure just because i naturally do it all the time because it's so easy now it was

01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.560
 a little bit of a pain in the ass on the pyramid to do that and then you had like that touchpad and

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:06.560
 it was just sketch and editing it was a fucking nightmare and this is like so simple now since

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:11.760
 you have these multiple midi ends i mean can you this is weird but we haven't really talked about

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:18.160
 this in a long time can you see getting a midi controller just for the habax no okay um mainly

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.720
 and i originally thought i was going to use because i have a key step already yeah but that isomorphic

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:26.960
 keyboard i would actually pick that over another keyboard okay so everything is everything that

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:32.080
 you want is surfaced yeah because i used to even with the performer use the midi keyboard like

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:36.320
 hooked into it just to like it was easier to play notes on that it was like you know pick a step

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.040
 and select the note which is fine for me again i'm not like joe keyboard player here i'm just trying

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:46.240
 to like figure out some pitches real quick and the isomorphic is easier for me especially knowing

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:51.200
 like when you have a scale mode set to it you can play melodies where you can't really play a sour

01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:55.920
 note right right because you're forcing scales to stuff and that's like really really nice

01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:01.520
 like they really like upped everything that was wrong with the pyramid fixed every problem and

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:09.120
 made some like incredible platform it's so good they killed it damn it sounds amazing yeah couldn't

01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:15.920
 be happier with it it's favorite sequencer ever you can even it's like flexible with time you can

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:20.720
 kind of like time like you know like clip warping enabled and you can be back on here with midi

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:25.680
 in like really fun ways where you can there's like a what is it called flexibility or something

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:30.320
 like that i forget the name for it but you can like stretch sequences out like you can time stretch

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:34.640
 sequences right what is awesome yeah which is pretty cool yeah i haven't even done it much yet but

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:40.960
 it's like it's there yeah yeah really nice control like individual timing for each track like each

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:47.520
 sequence is very flexible and there's some effects like it strangely lacks the midi delay that's on

01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:51.440
 the pyramid which is one of the best midi effects they haven't put that one on yet and people are

01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:56.160
 like why haven't you done that and i guess it's just on that roadmap yeah yeah probably not in time

01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:03.440
 for your show though no which is fine i can it's i can roll with it as it is right now as long as it

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:08.960
 doesn't crash i'm thrilled exactly plus you've got the um the burden of me standing in the audience

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:14.720
 with a barrel full of rotten tomatoes yep throwing them at you so you got bigger problems than whether

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:19.520
 or not that's going to time stretch placed my plexi shield order already well it's a very smart

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:24.720
 move and new designs that hopefully will support your attacks but i don't know if it's going to work

01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:31.600
 all right so great do you have anything else on your list not really um i mean i had a few other

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:38.880
 things on the list but um didn't really have time to take notes do you want to mention patreon

01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:48.000
 great tell me more about this patreon patreon case you missed it is live as of last episode um

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.640
 and i think currently we have like 13 people that have subscribed so we haven't hit our first uh

01:46:52.640 --> 01:47:00.960
 goal of 25 no we're getting closer trying to what do we promise at 25 was it 25 i believe we promised

01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:08.480
 swag yeah so we got our new rolling papers which we got quite nice rolling papers

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:14.640
 i've looked amazing they uh they work very well and i'm picky about paper material and then we have

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:20.400
 some stickers so once we have that 25 mark we'll send you some papers and stickers unless you don't

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:25.200
 want papers we'll give you more stickers or whatever the fuck you want what about koozies

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:31.440
 we've got a couple koozies kicking around still too got some koozies yeah i actually have some from

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:38.560
 the original batch too same i've got okay so i'm sure we can wrangle up 25 koozies that's a rare

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:46.960
 oop yeah yeah we need to do this like mpr style for the cost of one cup of coffee per month you

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:53.200
 could support all this great content and news coverage so real quick yeah what is that voice

01:47:53.200 --> 01:48:00.320
 you're doing um is that your mpr gross that's that's your terry gross that's uh rename on tane all right

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:11.200
 larkin page shake yeah join up get us closer to this swag goal speaking of patreon did we have

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:18.400
 anything we want to talk about as far as our patreon's asking us to talk about do we well there were

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:24.320
 two emails one was um i log into my email this morning yet you got email account here yeah you

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:28.800
 know we got do yeah let me know okay we're doing this live yeah let's do a live all right so one

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:33.840
 fucking live all right we're doing this live um one's gonna be a little we're probably not gonna do

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:38.640
 or we're not be able to have a lot to talk about but i i will have this here any second here technology

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:47.440
 so uh one of our one of our patreon supporters when you put out the question what we talk about

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:56.320
 um they this is very simple one word with a period straga oh yeah shit

01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:01.920
 i figured this would be a curveball maybe we did that before we have talked about straga in the past

01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:06.960
 in fact i think we kind of drive it through the mud we should on straga we should on it pretty good

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:11.920
 if i recall and i don't feel like my opinion on it has changed at all in the years honestly mine has

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:19.600
 gotten worse oh really yeah um so i will i would say pull up that previous episode it should i don't

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:24.080
 remember off the top of my head what episode number it is but we did discuss straga previously

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:29.840
 and we all kind of determined that it was not worth the money it would be roughly like a month

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:35.520
 after when it was announced like we went hard on it like right away right out the yeah and then

01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:39.520
 you were at one point like oh maybe it could work for five seconds then you were quickly like nah i

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:45.280
 had that vibe again recently um i was trying to figure out like because i'm running out of

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.320
 rack space and i was like i would like to have a small self-contained not necessarily since

01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:56.800
 like i don't need like a virus per se or anything that deep i just need something as like an outboard

01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:03.040
 drone creator to create textures and drones um just that could probably do pretty well yeah

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:07.440
 straga pop back in my head and i was like oh maybe i could do straga and i listened to more and more

01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:14.080
 demos of it and it just seems like no one is able to master this thing right it just seems very

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:21.280
 inconsistent very unwieldy yeah not really worth the money and for the price there's other options

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:25.920
 i will also point out that like looking at like different synthesizer instagrams and youtube

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.640
 channels and all that um basically every other piece of gear pops up here and there

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:38.800
 with some regularity i have yet to see straga pop up as like a centerpiece or something like

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:44.720
 even people using it like the zero post shows up all the ten times yeah yeah like ten times as much

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:51.360
 like this is the o-post to some say yes whatever whatever coast ex-coast it is the absence of a

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:58.960
 coast yes um that pops up all the time and like straga never pops up not too much no and like the

01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:02.880
 videos that i have seen even the people that are demoing it kind of like yeah i don't know why it's

01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:08.240
 making this sound but we're just rolling it you know i mean like i i think if you were going to go

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:16.720
 with an experimental box synth to do like drones and textures you would be better off getting the

01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:24.400
 lira oh yes 100 percent agree the soma lira um i mean that also seems confusing and a lot of

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:29.200
 people say it's a pain and you ask to dial in what you want and attune it but the results

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:33.920
 always seem to be more rewarding for people like yeah people still love that machine even though

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:37.440
 it confounds them whereas the straga a lot of people are like i don't know what the fuck this

01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:43.920
 thing's doing you know what i mean it's like and i've seen people use lira in a live setting and even

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:49.680
 sort of like joyously like whoa this is doing something weird but the sounds were still delightful

01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:53.920
 and i feel like the straga should be about half the price if it was half the price

01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:58.480
 i would be more inclined to give it a whirl yeah but it seems like you're paying the

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:05.680
 alisandre quartini name tax which is what drives that price i think we talked about that um

01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:10.240
 oh yeah initially when like we first started talking when we talked about it what is it like

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:18.400
 600 599 oh i would pay 399 maybe tops for a straga you know yeah firebox for a little

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:24.320
 inconsistent experimental soundbox that i only used at home and like maybe got something cool i

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:29.200
 recorded accidentally zero coast is underbox less it's kind of surprising to me which i think it

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:33.760
 would be a lot more useful yeah that's what i would want because it doesn't have the quartini name tax

01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:40.080
 or you gotta point it to the tax um yeah i don't know yeah my opinion of straga i don't think it's

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:45.680
 changed if anyone wants to send this one to to borrow and put through its paces maybe that'll

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:50.880
 change our mind and prove us wrong yeah but as it stands now i'm not taking that leap or spinning my

01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:55.760
 hard-earned dollars on us and we've shown a malleability to changing our beliefs like we

01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:01.920
 are sure routinely admit that we were wrong and change our opinion so we're not we're not stubborn

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:08.480
 yeah you can send us one and we might do it spaces we will yes so there's another message we got

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:17.680
 if you be game to an open end to the question it would be great to hear each of you describe

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:24.160
 your most fondly remembered creative session or process oh shit oh that's a good fucking question

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:32.400
 really good question yeah off the top of my head i would probably say like the first week i spent

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:41.600
 with the overstayer modular channel that was like a game changer like because when i started playing

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:45.360
 with that thing that was also where i was at like a creative low point i just wasn't feeling a lot

01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:52.160
 of inspiration um and then i think you know finally arrived um i was like okay i'm not really feeling

01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:57.520
 creative right now but i'll just try to learn this thing and it just kind of like made me feel

01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:05.760
 inspired it was like inspiring to work with it was kind of a game changer um the latest release

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:11.360
 like the the album that i just put out you know and taco was the split with kevin like that wouldn't

01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:18.640
 exist if it wasn't for me trying to learn that thing like the the first you know me trying to

01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:24.400
 learn it ended up yielding results and i started recording and recording and it was a lot of fun

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:31.200
 very inspirational and a lot of those chunks that i recorded ended up in that album um so it's a

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:37.280
 very fun memory of me of like that box was like the first thing that i ever purchased that felt like

01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:43.440
 if i had the engineering know-how this is what i would create right you know as like a distortion

01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:50.960
 saturation box it was a fucking orgasmic dream to to work with that that's what pops into my brain

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:58.480
 i've got uh i've got two answers um first off um is working with Nick

01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:03.600
 with narwhorz throat stuff there have been times when we've been sitting in your house

01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:10.160
 where i am giggling maniacal where i'm like i don't we did it we landed on something and it's

01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:15.520
 you know hours of work and it's just everything just comes together in this way that is just

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:24.000
 um and i rarely ever get that by myself at home and so that's that's my first answer um as far as

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:30.160
 like just a purely creative like holy shit like just it's the giggling that uh that i remember

01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:36.720
 fondly like those spots it's just like wow exactly and then the second one is um two times over the

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:42.800
 last like 20 years i've taken on like sort of a weird engineering challenge and i got it to work

01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:52.240
 and i vividly remember like i am basically the opposite of a jock um but both times like i did

01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:58.320
 this thing of like i like i'm like one was getting a gameboy to come to send data to a windows pc

01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:04.800
 and the second one was recently where i basically tried to recreate the lebanets binary system

01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:09.680
 with our doeno and both times when i got to that point where like i actually got that first second

01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:16.640
 when it worked and um this is shameful i i i'm not proud of this but i literally did like a fist

01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:25.120
 pump like yes have either of you seen me do that ever so it this is this shameful secret in my house

01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:32.400
 of me like yeah uh doing a phospatic one too like you did it oh and and impulsive like like i

01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.640
 didn't i couldn't stop myself from doing it like i didn't stop and go well now's the time to fist pump

01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:42.320
 it was literally like yes and then stop and going all right well i need to check why that happens but

01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:49.280
 um so yeah the sort of like those um crossing those sort of like big engineering challenge

01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.240
 chasms um and doing something like this may not ultimately work and then working on it for a

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:59.200
 couple weeks and getting it to work has been uh those have been big yeah those are my those are my

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:04.080
 two answers yeah i would say to you again like working with you um on that stuff and especially

01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:09.200
 editing like it's always like really easy for us to sit down on a computer and edit tracks together

01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:13.520
 and that could be you know like a difficult or it's a challenging part of the process

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:18.000
 absolutely yeah but it's always like really easy to do that and then the other one that's like

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.960
 super notable for me would be getting the electron machine drum which was like a huge

01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:30.240
 change in many things for me um working back with hardware again becoming obsessed with drum

01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:35.520
 machines because that was like my first like real i had a 505 when i was like you know 18 or

01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:39.440
 something like that but that's like not anything near it but getting that most expensive thing

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.080
 i'd purchased the time i got like a credit card to get it because it obviously didn't have

01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:49.840
 that much cash to get it and um just like i would get home for weeks i would get home from work and

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:55.360
 i would look up it would be 10 or 11 o'clock and i was still in my work clothes hadn't eaten i was

01:57:55.360 --> 01:58:01.200
 like oh fuck i did it again because i was just like my brain meld with that thing you know and that

01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:08.000
 was just like a different change for how i worked on everything that like everything since then

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:13.280
 has been different for me and what i focus on and that like really got me into playing live again

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:17.280
 a number of other things yeah this day i don't think i can look at a machine drum and not think

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:23.600
 of you yeah right yeah yeah like i just associate machine drum with Nick at this point yeah it's still

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:29.040
 a still wouldn't mind if one swung around my way again someday but i know enough to about it to

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:35.040
 know that like it's not yeah you've outgrown it yeah a little bit like it would be fun to have it to

01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:39.840
 add to accents to tracks but not for the price that they go for now it seems to like it just

01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:47.280
 seems to keep filling up like even the basic first model is like over a thousand dollars yeah yeah

01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:53.200
 yeah very true but uh definitely changed my brain for sure and how i thought about things like

01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:59.840
 parameter locks and it got along well with that system of working nice well thank you to our

01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:05.840
 patreon uh those are good questions good questions yeah questions no whippings this month

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:20.960
 well yeah that's drastic yeah that's some whippings this month less less than usual

01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:33.640

01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:38.640
