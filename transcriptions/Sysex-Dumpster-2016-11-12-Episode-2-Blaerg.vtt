00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.960
 - Introducing, this is Scott.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.520
 Scott makes music as a blog,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.620
 and Scott, tell us about yourself.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.120
 (laughs)

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.160
 That's a big question.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.420
 I guess, you know, I've been making music under that moniker

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.220
 for about 12 years, and...

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.980
 I guess I think of it as break core,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.380
 but it's maybe not hard and heavy enough

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.580
 for some people to meet that categorization,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.220
 so it sort of gets lumped with IDM,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.300
 maybe even though I don't really think of it as that.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.740
 And I've seen the drill and base tag attached to that a lot,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.100
 which I don't think is even a valid tag of at all.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 - I don't know what that means.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.420
 - Yeah, it doesn't mean anything, so.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.060
 Yeah, I've just been doing that for a long time.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.900
 Now it seems like, and...

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.420
 I've had some great experiences along the way

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.020
 with doing that, and...

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.740
 Pretty satisfied with my output so far,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.620
 but always looking to improve and try new things,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.020
 learn new stuff, and...

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.340
 I'm right on the edge of starting to transform my sound

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.940
 in a pretty significant way, in my opinion, significant,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.780
 but...

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.540
 What's significant about that change?

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.660
 I'm curious, like...

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.660
 Abandoning the step sequencer software approach

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.660
 and bringing in a different compositional method

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.900
 with the use of the title cycles software.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.940
 - So what were you using before title the sequence?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.060
 - FL Studio.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.860
 - Okay, that's all I got.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.020
 - So for a long time, it was basically...

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.860
 I didn't get into synthesizers until a few years ago,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.740
 it was more into samples and seeing what could be done

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.900
 with samples exclusively, so...

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.980
 It was basically just FL Studio and Soundforge.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.220
 - Yeah, I remember one of those first introduced to your stuff.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.860
 You're doing everything like destructive editing, right?

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.700
 Like within Soundforge, you'd bounce stuff out

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.900
 and then just do destructive editing

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.380
 with the Soundforge, that's pretty cool.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.660
 You still go that route after you render

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.500
 what you're working on?

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.420
 - Yeah, I mean, Soundforge is great

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.860
 for just very rapidly editing things down

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.220
 into usable pieces and after a while,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.340
 I got into audio mulch too, so that's kind of...

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.300
 - Nice, yeah.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.340
 - Shapes things in different ways that aren't so static

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.340
 or whatever, but...

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.460
 I think I kind of reached the conclusion

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.100
 of the entirely sample-based approach,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.420
 at least for myself, and started to get interested

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.220
 in synthesizers, which I'd always kind of,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.940
 for some reason, skewed that,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.540
 but I would use samples of other people's synthesizers,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.540
 which is kind of dumb or whatever,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.940
 but I don't know, I got interested in that,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.340
 and then that kind of segued into,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.580
 do I want to explore this modular thing that's happening?

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.380
 And I took the plunge on that, very glad I did.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.740
 I've actually learned a lot more about,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.100
 just regular synthesizers like hardware stuff

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.860
 from using modular.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.580
 - Yeah, I've had that experience too.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.900
 - Yeah, it's really opened it up for me,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.620
 made it a lot more,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.460
 I can get a lot more utility out of things

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.140
 that are what I thought kind of vanilla.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.780
 You can actually, if you really get in there

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.900
 and dig with the parameters,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.660
 you can do more stuff with simpler items,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.660
 but that kind of quickly was followed

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.860
 with my introduction to the title Cycles software,

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.100
 and so now I'm sort of at this point

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.260
 where utilizing those two things,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.980
 totally abandoning the step sequencing linear,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.220
 like visual kind of creating music with,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.220
 doing that new approach has been really exciting for me,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.220
 and it's really flexible

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.460
 and it's easy to get to very complex results

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.660
 in a short span of time

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.700
 versus plotting out every single, you know,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.300
 discrete event.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.900
 - So could you explain how you integrate the two,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.580
 the modular and the title,

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.980
 and how are you using them sort of together?

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.140
 - So title is a pretty new development,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.620
 it's open source, I believe that's the word

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.660
 you wanna use for it, I'm not real,

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.580
 that's not my world,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.780
 I'm only dealing with this thing

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.220
 because it's an interesting tool to me.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.660
 I'm not a programmer, I'm not, you know,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.580
 that good with computers in general, I wouldn't say,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.660
 but my introduction to that was just

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.980
 a sample based manipulation thing,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.020
 so it plays patterns, you can use samples

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.780
 and pattern them out in strange ways,

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.380
 but shortly after I started to get a little bit,

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.460
 you know, adept with using that kind of code

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.780
 to manipulate samples,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.700
 they came out with title MIDI,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.140
 so that allows you to use all of the sort of,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.100
 I don't know what would the word be like,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.100
 the parlance of title with sending MIDI signals,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.060
 so that opened up programming, strange stuff

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.860
 with that code, both samples and MIDI,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.100
 and then also translating MIDI stuff to CV

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.940
 with a Kenton module that I have,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.940
 and that sort of like those three things altogether

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.460
 is a very weird, flexible, recursive,

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.460
 you know, thing to employ,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.020
 so I was telling Nick on the way over here,

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.580
 I'm really excited to finally start implementing

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.580
 real time parallel, like execution of patterns,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.820
 some of it being MIDI, some of it being samples,

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.660
 and just recording the final output,

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.180
 versus making stuff, recording it,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.500
 editing it down and then bringing it

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.420
 into the sample environment,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.060
 'cause there's benefits to both,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.060
 so what I really would like to get to

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.060
 is a point where I can set up an environment of things

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.540
 and it might be different per track or whatever, but,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.380
 - Sure.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.660
 - Just, you know, having like,

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.340
 modulars going into audio mulch

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.260
 and I'm controlling audio mulch with title,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.020
 and I'm also using samples in title,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.380
 and all this stuff is coexisting,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.540
 but it's all related and coming from the same,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.540
 like, plane of operation, so it's really,

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.100
 there's a lot of possibilities there,

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.060
 and it's pretty exciting,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.780
 and it kind of helps me get to a place where,

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.860
 you know, I kind of have these ideas in my head

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.660
 of things I would like to accomplish,

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.740
 but I would never be able to do them

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.780
 just doing step-based programming,

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.660
 because it's just, you know,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.260
 you have to divide things and count stuff,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.420
 and when you have title, you're just saying,

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.980
 like, this pattern is this,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.540
 and I want it to do this at this time,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.140
 and it just does the math for you,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.140
 and that makes it fast,

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.620
 and you get the cool result,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.500
 and you can just do it and move on,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.260
 so I don't like belaboring over tracks,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.420
 it's really painful, and, you know,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.460
 my history has been to spend six months

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.660
 making a three-minute track,

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.660
 that gets old, so I like to move on to the next thing.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.020
 - What got you into modular?

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.900
 Like, I'm always curious what the first thing

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.740
 somebody saw that was like,

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.260
 "Oh, I want to try that."

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.340
 It was a maths for me in QMMG,

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.180
 it was a very classic, like,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.940
 second wave, Euro-rack, like,

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.180
 hmm, I gotta try that,

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.860
 'cause I'll never afford to surge,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.220
 or, you know, that type of thing.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.780
 - I think, you know, I looked at the Muff's forum for a while,

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.340
 and was just sort of like,

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.460
 wow, that's a whole lot of things to think about,

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.180
 and not really knowing, like,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.580
 how you would even use it,

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.300
 just out of curiosity,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.860
 kind of dipping in with that for a while,

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.460
 but I think, you know,

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.060
 the first time I moved to Minneapolis,

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.060
 and then that has Fox Zone music there,

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.660
 so I was able to just physically walk into a place

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.900
 where there's a ton of that stuff,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.220
 and I was fortunate enough to go there on a day

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.820
 when Logan from Logaine was there,

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.660
 and he was working with Eric at Fox Zone in some capacity,

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.500
 and literally these guys spent, like,

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.860
 three hours just taking me through the basics.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.220
 Like, you know, like, this is a potential customer,

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.940
 and they spent that time, like, saying, like,

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.740
 you know, I'm thinking, I'm kind of walking in there, like,

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.460
 if I were to try to maybe buy some stuff,

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.660
 what would I do, you know,

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.620
 and they were really, really nice,

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.060
 and spent that time doing that,

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.460
 and made it a lot more approachable, I think,

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.500
 than if I were to just kind of try to wing my way through it

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.060
 by, like, buying stuff online or whatever.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.860
 - Yeah, yeah, it could be a costly trial and error.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.220
 - Yeah, and so that made it,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.820
 that made it a lot less intimidating, I think,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.220
 and so I bought some stuff and...

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.300
 - What was your first one?

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:16.620
 - I think I got a tip-top oscillator,

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.500
 and a maths and a VCA.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:26.620
 I think I got a Pittsburgh filter too,

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:31.340
 and then shortly after that, another oscillator,

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.900
 and another filter, and...

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.700
 - Then the wheels came off and you just couldn't stop.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.820
 - Yeah, you know, and I'm the kind of person that dives in,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.220
 and does a minimal amount of education possible,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.500
 so, you know, there's, of course, a fried module,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.580
 and totally my fault, you know,

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.500
 that kind of learning process, so yeah.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.460
 But yeah, I got that stuff, and shortly,

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.540
 this was before I'd come across titles,

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.540
 so it didn't really, that didn't really come into play

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.260
 until later, but I got the CV to MIDI right away,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.380
 'cause I wanted to be able to sequence with the,

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.020
 you know, with the DAW, so...

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.500
 - Hmm.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.500
 - Yeah, and I just kind of played that game of,

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.300
 well, I'm just gonna get it this much,

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.980
 and then that'll be, I'll stop,

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.060
 and I'm beyond nine you at this point,

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.060
 and I have a kind of like purposefully got a case

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.700
 that's way too big, so it's like never gonna be full,

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.380
 and it's still like one third empty, I think, so.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.380
 I kind of got over that module last after a year or so of that,

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:44.580
 and now I'm more casual about, you know,

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.060
 I have plenty of stuff to use,

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.900
 and it's not like I'm dying to have like,

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.300
 any specific thing, and so I can just kind of have fun

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.620
 with it, use it, learn, try to get some depth

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.420
 with the stuff that I do have, and...

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.540
 - Yeah, that's the sweet spot, kinda.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.380
 - I totally still feel like an infant in terms of like,

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.340
 the things I know, and I'm very like,

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:10.340
 I try to approach it very, like, always with a blank slate,

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:15.340
 like, I'll try to maybe read about a particular technique,

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.060
 and then just do I have the stuff to do that,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.740
 and then try to implement it, and, you know,

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.060
 at the same time, maybe produce something musically usable,

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.820
 but yeah, I still feel very humbled by the amount of knowledge

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.140
 that you can come across on the muff's form,

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.860
 like, just the depth of that is astounding to me,

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.620
 so I feel like this is gonna be something I can pursue

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.180
 for probably the rest of my life,

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.420
 and never really even feel like I'm like super good at,

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.460
 you know, being a synthesis,

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.700
 but I like having that open-ended element to it,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.780
 and it's just, I mean, there's so much stuff

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.660
 you can do with it, there's so many modules,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.860
 but it's just mind-blowing, staggering amount of stuff

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.980
 to check out and learn about,

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.140
 so it's really fascinating to me.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.620
 - Yeah, growing all the time, too.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.940
 - Like, what was some of the things you've discovered

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.340
 moving to modular that maybe you couldn't do

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.060
 in other environments?

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.580
 Like, what are some of the things that, like, you've learned,

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.200
 or new tricks you've figured out?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:23.580
 - You know, just even what modulation is,

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.260
 just understanding that at a root level,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.620
 I think, has been a mind-opening thing,

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.500
 like, you know, so you have like envelopes

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.660
 and stuff like that, but using them to do things

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.420
 that, you know, fixed architecture since don't do,

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.860
 and like, well, what if you do that to this?

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.580
 And then it's like, well, that's awesome.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.420
 Why don't they have that?

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.900
 I'm like, everything, you know?

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.260
 So I can't think of anything specific, but yeah,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.260
 just the openness of it and the sort of like,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.100
 I mean, it's cool because it's like,

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.500
 it's so flexible that you have plenty of room

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.340
 to make crappy noises.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.260
 Like, it's totally up to you to shape it

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.900
 into something useful or not, and I don't know.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.260
 I don't know if I'm answering your question or not, but--

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.100
 - It doesn't matter.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.300
 It was not a great question.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.900
 Since the integration of a title in your setup,

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.500
 do you find like you're kind of gearing your rig

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.900
 towards a certain direction now,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.940
 where there might have been overlap with title?

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.060
 Or do you think like the two are going hand in hand

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.860
 pretty well with what you already have in your rig?

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.420
 - I think they're going pretty well hand in hand,

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.380
 and I think the stuff that I have right now

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.020
 is pretty bread and butter kind of things,

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.620
 and I really wanna continue to get stronger

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.760
 with those more classic techniques.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.260
 Before I move on to the, like, I don't know what it would be

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.540
 like the third wave, the crazy stuff, the weird, you know,

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.700
 I mean, there's so many, I can't even think of them, but--

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.620
 - So you're kind of using it mainly for like East Coast style

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.460
 synthesis right now.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.300
 - Yeah.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.060
 - You got your envelope, your filter, your voice,

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.100
 type of thing, okay.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.580
 - But I do like the make noise kind of weird,

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.980
 you know, applying things to aspects

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.460
 that you wouldn't think of.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.900
 You know, for an East Coast kind of style,

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.180
 but I like to blend the two as well.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.380
 - Sure.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.580
 - I feel like I need to get stronger

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.660
 on just the East Coast style first

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.900
 before I plunge more into the crazier stuff,

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.700
 but I know I'm gonna get there.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.820
 I mean, it's really enticing.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:37.140
 Modular has sort of opened me up to as well to like,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:42.740
 I've made so much music that's incredibly rigid

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.900
 and step, you know, this stops here and this starts there,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.540
 and this is always in time with this, like that kind of thing.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.540
 I've made so much of that kind of music

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.260
 that I'm really enticed by the floppy,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.420
 flexible quality of modular stuff, so.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.620
 - Getting off the grid.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.460
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.660
 And I like combining the two, so it's really, you know,

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.940
 you patch up the modular and like,

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.940
 you're running Renee with an envelope or something,

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.300
 so you're getting weird time

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.020
 that doesn't really have a BPM or whatever.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.780
 And you know, like this sounds great,

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.260
 I have no idea how I'm gonna use it,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.780
 how would this fit into like a step sequencer

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.380
 and that kind of thing.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.060
 You know, I recorded all that stuff

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.220
 'cause it was like, this sound is too good to just let it go.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.780
 But now actually with title, I'm able to bring that in

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.420
 a lot more easily because of the way it works.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.140
 It doesn't like box you in so much,

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:42.140
 so I like having this fleet free flowing weird

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.460
 gelatinous thing right upside,

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:51.340
 this really rigid like tight technical kind of thing.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.260
 And that's exciting to me.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.580
 So I guess in terms of timbers,

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.220
 maybe I'm not so far out there yet,

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:03.220
 but at least I'm moving toward like the not so skeletal,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.300
 hard, you know, one, two, three, four,

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.140
 one, two, three, four, kind of sequencing stuff

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.100
 with the modular itself, so.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.100
 - Are you sequencing a lot within your modular?

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.740
 Is that like strictly title at this point or other like?

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.300
 - I really, I like to do both actually.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.900
 I'm actually doing less of what I originally intended,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.500
 which was, you know, just one volt per octave,

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.500
 like, you know, linear melodies and stuff like that.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.260
 I thought that's more what I was gonna use

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.940
 with the MIDI to CV, but I found that I really want

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.860
 to explore doing weirder things.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.860
 So for instance, the Kenton has four CV outs,

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.860
 and so title can tell those CV outs to do LFOs or whatever.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.860
 I'm interested more, I'm more keen to like try putting

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.860
 all those into a logic module and seeing what that spits out

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.860
 and having a sequencer be driven by that,

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.860
 rather than just, no, no, no, no, you know,

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.860
 coming right out of the computer.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.860
 And so that's, it seems like you can just sort of try stuff

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.860
 and things will come out that you would never actually

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.860
 intentionally design that are way more interesting

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.860
 than what you may try to intentionally design.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.860
 - Absolutely, yeah, I feel you.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:26.860
 - Yeah, I used to describe it to myself as like structured chaos,

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.860
 you know what I mean?

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.860
 Like when I was trying to get into,

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.860
 when I was trying to break out of sequencing from my doll

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.860
 and more into modular sequencing,

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.860
 I wanted to find something that, you know,

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.860
 it would align on the grid in some fashion,

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.860
 but not necessarily be programmed to the grid, you know what I mean?

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.860
 Like you said, like have, you know, a comparator generating gates

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.860
 which would drive your sequencer, you know what I mean?

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.860
 And just coming up with entirely new structures that, I mean,

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.860
 there's definitely people out there that can think that up

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.860
 in software, but I'm not one of those, you know what I mean?

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.860
 Like the modular kind of brought that out of me easier.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.860
 I was able to figure out shit like that,

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.860
 which I was struggling to do in software using like the doll

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.860
 and things like that, you know?

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.860
 But yeah, I feel you.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.860
 Do you have any sequencers like straight up

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.860
 sequencers in your rig right now?

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.860
 - I mostly just use the Renee.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.860
 - Gotcha.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.860
 - I like what it, you know, especially like putting weird stuff

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.860
 into the clock and put that's, you know, like a square wave

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.860
 that the width is being modulated or something,

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.860
 so you get like bursts of notes rather than just one, two, three, four.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:42.860
 I need to, I've learned quite a lot from just using that sequencer,

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.860
 but I know there's still more.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:50.860
 I've never even implemented it to do, but it's, that's the main one.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.860
 And then I kind of, sometimes, you know, you can use transposition

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.860
 and cool ways with sequencers.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.860
 It's like, well, I'm using this $500 module to like make the note change.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.860
 Like every fourth thing, but, you know, or you can do it the other way too.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.860
 You can transpose it, but just having tools to do that stuff is cool

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.860
 and it's interesting to see what happens even if you're only using like this,

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.860
 you know, one-tenth of its power, but that doesn't mean next time you can't,

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.860
 like, have that be the center of the patch and have it be doing like this crazy

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.860
 octopus thing.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.860
 - So, sort of the opposite of that, what are some things that like you've got

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.860
 or you've used that surprise you as far as like disappointments?

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.860
 What's something you were like, this is going to be great, and then you started using it

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.860
 and you're like, this isn't clicking with me for some reason.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:42.860
 - The one that comes to mind most rapidly is the Wogglebug.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.860
 I don't even know why I bought that thing.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.860
 Like, I got so excited for it, I think, and I was, you know,

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:58.860
 maths was like, wow, and, you know, what was some of the, I know I've had a couple other,

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:03.860
 well, like, Renee, and then I don't know, I think I was watching the James Sigler demo

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.860
 of that or something, and I was like, oh, I can think of so many things going to do with this,

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.860
 and then I got one, and I just tried and tried and tried and could not get it to do anything

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:18.860
 I wanted it to do or anything random and cool, just, I mean, it didn't, that one surprised me,

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.860
 like, I thought that that was going to, because I didn't have any, any sort of random source

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:29.860
 in my rig at all, so, you know, I was like, well, I need this function, so I'm going to get it,

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.860
 and then just, I had to get rid of it, it just enraged me.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:33.860
 (laughter)

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:34.860
 - That's interesting, man.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.860
 I'm kind of like the total opposite.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.860
 Like, I bought a maths when they first came out, and I just never jived with it, like, really?

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:46.860
 - Yeah, I would see Nick do, like, crazy shit with his, and I'm just like, I would play with one,

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.860
 and I would just, you know, nothing would be coming out of it, like, that I was happy with,

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.860
 I ended up selling it within, like, a week, and I had one of the Mark 1 waggle bugs,

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.860
 and I loved it the shit, you know what I mean?

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.860
 I used it all over some of the Prometheus stuff towards the end there.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:07.860
 It was, it was using it for, you know, as a sound source and control, and then I sold it at one point,

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:14.860
 and now I have the new version, you know, the black panel, it's like slimmer, and I used the fuck out of that thing,

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:19.860
 like, I don't know, and I still don't have a maths to this day, like, I see people have, like, three, four maths in their system,

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.860
 and it's just like, I just don't get it, you know what I mean?

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.860
 Like, I have not wrapped my head around that module yet.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.860
 - So listeners of the program, they can email Greg and yell at him about that.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.860
 It's at stumpsur@gmail.com, I'm gonna address it to Greg.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:34.860
 - You guys have to be Greg.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:35.860
 - Fuck maths.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.860
 (laughter)

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.860
 - I used to have two, now I've won again, because two was a little too much, but...

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.860
 - Pretty wide.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.860
 - Yeah, it's a, yeah, I wanted a little more variety, but I would never sell it,

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.860
 but it's still one of my favorites, but...

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.860
 - It's personal.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.860
 - To each their own, and that's why we have all these different choices.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:59.860
 - Yeah, and you know, I've talked about things that I loved in even our last podcast that I've now sold.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.860
 - Really?

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.860
 - It's like, I don't know, next week, you never know, man.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:03.860
 - Yeah.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.860
 - So what are some of the things that you'll, you know, they can take out of your cold, dead hand,

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:13.860
 that you, you know, modules come and go, but this is gonna be an eriggy thing forever.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.860
 I don't even know if I have something like that.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.860
 I guess maybe I'm thinking of sound source ones.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:37.860
 You know, I just use a pair of the Tip Top Z3000s, and I have the old version of the PDO,

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.860
 but I still need to dig in with that one a bit more.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:47.860
 I don't think I have any super allegiance to any of those things I have.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.860
 They're all kind of potentially able to be sold, but...

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:57.860
 - Yeah, it's kind of like what I got now is, you know, I'm still learning it,

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:04.860
 so I'm not really bored with any of the things, but I don't have any super strong, like,

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.860
 do or die pieces.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.860
 That spring to my, I guess I don't have any, because nothing's springing to my, so...

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.860
 Are you like a super filter like, "Oh, I love filters," or is it more just like,

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.860
 "Yeah, I got a filter because I need it."

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.860
 - Type of thing. - I mean, I have four.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.860
 - There you go. - Probably too many.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.860
 - Probably too many. - Yeah.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.860
 - And those are just like... - Nope.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.860
 - Yeah, and you know, it's always like thinking about...

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.860
 Not, you know, I don't need to buy a slew. I have four filters.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.860
 You know, that kind of thing. I kind of forget about that, but...

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.860
 Yeah. I don't know. I like...

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:47.860
 I'm starting to work with percussion, but it's not really going that well yet,

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:53.860
 but that's kind of something I'm more interested in checking out, but, again,

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.860
 space and, you know, I don't know.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.860
 I like things that double as other things as much as possible.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.860
 So you're saying you're talking about like drum modules in particular,

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:09.860
 or making drum sounds out of a sound source, an envelope, and a VCA, or both.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.860
 Okay. Which ones have you tried?

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.860
 Like, which drum modules have you tried so far and enjoyed?

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.860
 I only have one, and I recently got it. It's the...

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.860
 Is it neuron audio damage?

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.860
 Oh, the 8HP drum.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.860
 - See, there was the wider one that came out. - It's...

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.860
 No, that's the boomchack is the wide one.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.860
 - And then there's the... - The neuron's the FM one, right?

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:32.860
 - That one. - Okay.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.860
 - And then there's the one. - Yeah, the boomchacks, like, I think more like analog style

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.860
 and the neuron's more FM.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:44.860
 I got that one, and so far I'm not able to do anything with it,

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.860
 but I haven't spent that much time with it either.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.860
 I feel like that was kind of like the woggle-bogg.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.860
 Like, I'm like, "Holy smokes." And like, I want that.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.860
 So I just straight up bought it, which I usually just try to find stuff you used.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.860
 - Yeah. - But I just... I was like, "I definitely want that."

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.860
 So I got it, and then I just can't seem to get it to do what I want,

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.860
 which is odd, but...

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.860
 I'm also sort of open to the idea of this could be something useful and cool

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.860
 that you didn't think you would use it in a certain way.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:19.860
 So I'm kind of thinking about why separate percussion and non-percussion sounds

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:26.860
 and maybe even why make it a bass sound or a lead sound or a pad sound.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.860
 Just kind of making patches and whatever they are is what they are.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.860
 So if it has a little bit of this percussion sound in it or whatever,

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.860
 it's just a piece of a thing and just trying to be more...

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.860
 I'm trying to give it another chance and see if I can work it in somehow.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.860
 But as far as just straight up drum beats,

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.860
 I've got a couple oscillators and a couple of filters and envelopes.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.860
 You sort of run out pretty quick if you're trying to build an entire drum kit.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.860
 So it's just an experiment to see what I can make out of it.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:06.860
 And it doesn't have to be the entire thing of percussion.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.860
 It can be supplemental to samples or whatever else.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.860
 So that's kind of the newest thing I've been working on.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:20.860
 It's kind of not really going that great, but it's all fumbling in baby steps all the time.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.860
 So whatever.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.860
 Do anything with breaks still when it comes to percussion?

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.860
 Or I guess I should say for your drum sounds,

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:34.860
 are you still using sample bass but synthesis for almost everything else?

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.860
 Or do you just not really differentiate anymore?

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.860
 You're saying you just kind of make patches and if it has percussion elements,

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.860
 then you just roll with that.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.860
 I kind of just grabbed from everywhere.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.860
 I was really heavily reliant on using natural drum sounds in the past,

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.860
 but trying to mangle them into things that don't sound like that.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:28:01.860
 I've opened more to non-natural sounds,

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.860
 especially like deep kick drums and stuff.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.860
 I always kind of shied away from that in the past.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.860
 I don't really know why, but after a while it just becomes like,

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.860
 "Well, there's more variety, so let's have that."

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.860
 Like, I always want more, so of course more is always better.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:23.860
 But yeah, I'm interested in trying to widen that out

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.860
 and actually using title pieces of break beats and so forth

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.860
 isn't really that ideal.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.860
 It's kind of better to use single shots.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:40.860
 So I kind of want to get into seeing how I can combine single shots

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:45.860
 with modular sounds and everything's kind of more like just one sound

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.860
 per trigger kind of deal.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.860
 I need to also explore the Nord modular for percussion,

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:57.860
 because there's a lot there, and that's probably my most neglected item

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:58.860
 that I have.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.860
 It's sort of like so amazing, but so wide that you can't,

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.860
 I don't know, it's sort of too big or something,

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.860
 sort of intimidating.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.860
 I could do anything.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.860
 I'll choose nothing.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.860
 Do you have the first or the GT with the first one?

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.860
 I have the mini or the micro.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.860
 Micro, yeah.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:17.860
 I used that one of those.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:18.860
 I kind of missed that thing.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.860
 Yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.860
 What's your setup for live performance now?

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.860
 Do you bring the modular out at all, or is that mostly studio only?

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.860
 I have never taken the modular anywhere.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.860
 The cases that I have are not at all portable.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.860
 They're incredibly unattractive items that, you know,

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:37.860
 did you make them?

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.860
 I didn't make them, but like the big black one that I have is

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.860
 really supposed to be for a mixer.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.860
 It's like the big carpeted box.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.860
 Oh, nice.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:51.860
 So like one of those awful looking, but really ergonomic.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.860
 Hey, so I dig that.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:30:04.860
 I don't feel like I would bring that stuff around just because I don't think it would work.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.860
 I can't change the sounds fast enough, and you know,

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.860
 I have to do quite a lot of noodling to get somewhere with sounds.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:16.860
 And I just, it just seems like not worth it.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:21.860
 So this will be my third performance with title.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.860
 So I haven't really even done that that much, and I'm not really sure where I'm going with that.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.860
 So that's going to be entirely sample based.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:34.860
 I considered bringing the micro modular and running title MIDI with that, but it just

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.860
 became too many things to juggle.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.860
 And when it's a lot of text on the screen, it just becomes like,

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.860
 oh my God, what is happening?

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:48.860
 I just wanted to pair it down and try to focus on having it sound the best that it can.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:54.860
 So yeah, I don't think I'm going to do that, but that could change.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:00.860
 Scott's playing at Wood Street Gallery tonight, which is a gallery downtown that actually has a

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.860
 Rio JK to exhibit on the floor underneath too.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.860
 So we were checking that out a little before we came over here to record this.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:12.860
 Kevin Bednar, who is Bednar, and Pittsburgh has done title live coding stuff in the past,

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.860
 and he's projected his screen on to the behind the meringue.

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.860
 Have you done that or are you planning on doing that?

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:22.860
 Because it's such an interesting thing, like you're not just someone standing there.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.860
 Like, if we can't see that conceptually, like, oh, I know that that's really cool,

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.860
 but once it's up there, you're like, oh, that's just hypnotic to watch.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.860
 Yeah.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.860
 Every time I've done a title performance, it's been projected.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:35.860
 That's cool.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.860
 There may be some disappointment because I'm not really going to be manipulating the code that much

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:46.860
 because I'm just playing not that good at it yet.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:56.860
 It's really not something that I've developed a skill in in terms of improvising and making

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.500
 the code change in real time.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:06.740
 I will do a completely free form improvisation at the end, I think, but in terms of the length

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:12.420
 of the set, it's going to be more like straightforward use of the code that already exists because

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.820
 it's pretty complicated.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.860
 And just to even toy with it a little bit, it makes it fall apart sometimes.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:22.860
 We have seen that because we've seen Kevin doing something and it's just like, air, air,

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.860
 air, like just a screen just fills it red, which is really cool to see.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.740
 But like, I can imagine like just watching the calamity unfold.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:37.860
 Trying to troubleshoot code while you're like in front of a group of people.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.860
 Not a fun experience.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.860
 Yeah.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:47.860
 Yeah, just reminded me, I do love watching like the projection of that.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:51.580
 You know, I mean, even if there's not too much manipulation going on, like the first time

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:57.340
 I watched Kevin's use title, it just reminded me of like the year 2001 when I had first

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:03.300
 seen like Zannoff to Khan and people like Dave and everyone doing stuff live.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.900
 And you know, I was only experimenting with shit in my bedroom at that point.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.740
 I'd never really conceived of how this could be done live, you know what I mean?

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:15.820
 And I would see like Ryan with his two desktop computers and a DJ mixer and like, you know,

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.620
 the dual and FL studio and all this shit going on in the screen.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:21.460
 I'm just like, I have no fucking idea what I'm looking at.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.460
 You know what I mean?

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.580
 When I'd peep his screen, but I was like, it's cool to see.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.580
 You know what I mean?

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.460
 Like, you don't see that too much these days.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.460
 You know what I mean?

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:33.420
 Like, you have no idea what's happening behind the scenes on somebody's laptop.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.420
 You know what I mean?

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.660
 Like, I have no problems with someone doing a laptop performance.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.660
 You know what I mean?

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.660
 I know some people do.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.380
 And I think having that projection helps those people that are still kind of like hesitant

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:48.100
 to like, you know, give credit to a laptop performer and they're like, oh, you know,

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.420
 they're just pushing a button.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.420
 Right.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.420
 They're not just pushing play.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.420
 There's something going on.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.900
 They're not just checking their email.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.900
 Right.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.900
 There's something actually happening there.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:02.100
 You know, it's fucking cool to see, you know, that that window into what is happening,

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.460
 no matter what it is, or even see it air out, you know what I mean?

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:09.300
 Like, I remember a few times, you know, things would crash like at hacker fest and things

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.300
 like that.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:16.140
 I mean, computer crashes going on gaps in the performances, but, you know, it added to the,

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.700
 I don't know, the magic of it.

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.700
 Yeah, exactly.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.340
 It's like, this really is on the cost of falling apart.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.340
 Right.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.300
 I was like, these guys are taking risks, you know what I mean?

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.500
 They're not just bouncing out.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.820
 They're set to a CD and pushing play.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.740
 Like they're, you know, it's risky business.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:37.660
 And it was really interesting to see that blew my mind in 2001 and, you know, yeah,

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.020
 changed the way I thought about everything.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.780
 I haven't really been the same sense, you know what I mean?

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:45.580
 So I think it's cool that, you know, people like you and Kevin utilizing title, I think,

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:51.700
 will maybe inspire people who, you know, the next generation of people who want to get

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:57.380
 in electronic music and, you know, want to utilize a laptop and get crazy with it and

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.620
 not just generate like, you know, house music or something.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:00.620
 You know what I mean?

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.980
 Like, this is, I think this is like a interesting doorway for people like that who have not

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:05.980
 seen it before.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:11.140
 Yeah, I definitely had that experience, what you're talking about when I first saw title

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:17.340
 used, which was by a guy named Mike that lives in the Minneapolis area.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:22.140
 He produces under the name kindome, kindome.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.740
 I always thought it was kindome, but he says kindome.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.660
 He's like an anagram of his name.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:33.220
 So I saw him perform with it and he's quite masterful at the improvisational element.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:38.620
 And yeah, because, you know, I heard about it.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:44.000
 I heard about, you know, he was actually on NPR, Minnesota Public Radio, short piece talking

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.580
 about this because at that point he was kind of involved in like, code camp stuff for kids

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:55.140
 and like trying to engage like young people around doing coding and stuff and his thing

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.940
 was using this music thing.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.540
 So he was on for that and I had heard about that and I listened to it and I thought, well,

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.980
 it's probably really dumb.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.980
 That's probably really lame.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.100
 And I checked it out anyway and I was really impressed.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.020
 So I emailed him and he was playing soon.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:14.780
 So I went to go see him and then I was like, okay, I'm literally only a person watching

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.380
 it, but I mean, I was floored.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:23.100
 I was like, dude, you have to help me figure out how to do this because I want to do this.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:28.340
 And seeing the seeing the text on the screen and not having any clue what any of that stuff

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:34.300
 means, but listening and having that feedback and looking at it and seeing it change and

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:40.620
 then executing it and hearing it change, even just after that first observation of that

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.340
 performance, I kind of had an idea of what was going on.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:49.540
 It was like, it seemed approach, it seems like so futuristic and alien, but also very

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.860
 approachable.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.940
 And fortunately, he's a nice enough dude to like really spend some time helping me get

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.020
 up and running with that.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:06.100
 And yeah, it's refreshed my enthusiasm for making music potentially more than it even

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.500
 was when I first started.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.740
 It's like that exciting to me.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.740
 I cannot.

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:16.420
 Like, I will sit and write code with title over hours on end and not get tired of it

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.580
 because it's just so fascinating and flexible and fun.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:26.980
 And you'll be able to see that tonight, even if I'm not manipulating code that much.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:33.820
 I think the code will probably be far more dense than what you may have seen Kevin do.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.540
 And then it has a lot of like cheater notes and stuff with weird names.

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.140
 I like code comments.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.140
 Yeah.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.140
 Yeah.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.140
 That's trying to say that shit.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.140
 It's totally necessary.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:47.580
 It's just it's literally like a huge, long page of just blocks and blocks and blocks

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.580
 of code.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.820
 Plus it's not it doesn't have indentation like like a C++ or Java.

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.380
 It can if you want it to.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.620
 I've never seen that before.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.620
 It can if you wanted to.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.700
 I didn't ever learn.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.140
 I never learned anything the right way.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.140
 So it doesn't.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.140
 Mine doesn't.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.980
 And it's probably harder to look at for that reason.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.020
 But yeah, it's not.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.900
 It looks like a mess.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.420
 Actually, I would go back to like you were talking about like can dumb.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.740
 I've never actually seen it in perform, but I've only heard recordings of it.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:23.660
 So even without seeing that the that element of the real time manipulation, all the changes

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.420
 he's doing, sonically, it's still also super interesting.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.260
 The recording of yours.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.900
 I think I've only heard one of your recordings.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.060
 Is there only one recording of a performance?

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.060
 Yeah, performance.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.820
 Yeah, there was one I put out on SoundCloud for a while.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.300
 Likewise, it sounded amazing.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.220
 But even without seeing all of that cool stuff with it.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.220
 Yeah.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:49.900
 And yeah, I think the having a good outcome that an interesting pleasing musical outcome

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.820
 is always the bottom line.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.500
 And it helps you get to really strange conclusions.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:01.820
 It just timing is so easy to be so flexible with and complex with, but you can also be

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.740
 really straight with it too.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.660
 And there's a you can swap between the two and I mean, like the things you can do with

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.660
 time signatures.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.660
 It's just great.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.140
 I love it.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:19.300
 How much like I'm curious, how would you do like a like a recursive kind of rhythm that's

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.940
 like, you know, like an effects balancing ball thing?

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.740
 Is that like something that you can conceptualize in your head, how you would do it in there?

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.540
 That's like a I don't know how that would like work.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:38.100
 Yeah, you could because you can, you know, you can just make a pattern and have it's you

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:45.980
 can have a pattern that just has the one sound, but then you can say every other or every

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:51.940
 next pattern, you can say increase the density of that pattern by decimal points.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:58.100
 So you could say you could create a like a piece of arithmetic that says every time next

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.100
 time a little bit faster.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.340
 Okay, like there's ways to do that.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:07.140
 Yeah, do you find like, Oh, I want to kind of get better at math now that you've like

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.140
 got in the title?

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.140
 No, okay.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.500
 I was playing with some generative graphics stuff the other night like stupid JavaScript

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:18.340
 and HTML5 stuff and I was like, Oh, I hit this wall where it's like, I better learn

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.540
 a lot like I better get much better at algebra.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.900
 And I was kind of like, Oh, fuck this.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.700
 Fortunately with title, there's a there.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.900
 It's kind of sprung out of an academic place.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.740
 So there's all these, Oh, let's be mean and call them like code goons or something.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:34.740
 I don't know.

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:40.220
 They're just so into like, look how elegantly I'd made this weird thing.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.060
 And then they don't want to use it for anything, but those guys are willing to share that stuff

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.060
 with you.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:49.540
 So, you know, I was asking this one guy in particular, I won't say what he is, but you

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.700
 know, he's like, you just call him a good.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:56.620
 He's kind of always got, he's kind of always got a solution to any kind of question.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:00.380
 Like, how would you do this if you wanted to be like, well, you do this.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.140
 And I'm like, could you provide an example?

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.980
 And then all you got, if you got that example, then you can twist that and change the values

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.260
 and stuff and make it do all kinds and naughty stuff.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:16.340
 So there's a bunch of custom stuff I've incorporated into the back end of title for my particular

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.780
 machine that is of that ilk.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.100
 And there's like, you know, it's just about how cleverly can you code it?

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:28.340
 Like if you really know the nuts and bolts, but if you don't, if you just have the example

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:33.180
 and you have it in there, you can turn a huge function into a single word.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.660
 So like every three do this thing.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:41.460
 And it's your specific code that you made and it's like, it's great.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:47.340
 I want to be able to like make an artistic effect in the end of my care at that point.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:51.700
 That's when I realized when I got like max for live or whatever, max MSP, it's like,

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:56.260
 I like using people's stuff, but I have no interest in digging into that or reactor or

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.260
 anything.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:01.300
 Like the modular is kind of how I experiment like that because that's just more fun and

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.700
 readily understood by me.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:05.300
 I was like a definitely deaf on programmer for years.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.060
 You know, I was quote unquote programmer.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:13.540
 I was a good googler and theft straight up.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.700
 Just end on me being a thief and a podcast.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.700
 [laughter]

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:45.500
