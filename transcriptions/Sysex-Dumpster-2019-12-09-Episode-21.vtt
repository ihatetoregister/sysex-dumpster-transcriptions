 [Music]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 [Music]

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 What are you gentlemen drinking?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Smooth. This is a dry cider from Threadbear.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 It's a little cider place and metery.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 It's the Wigull Whiskey. It's their cider house. It's fucking delicious.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 It is. It's really dry.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Have you partaken in any mead?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 No. Oh wait, that's not true.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 They have flights, like cider flights.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 I think one of them had mead once. I'm not a huge fan of mead.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 I want to because it's very D&D.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 It's a drink from the fantasy realm.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Exactly. That's why I wanted to like it and then I just couldn't get into it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 But they have it and I assume it's good because this is fucking delicious.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 It's very dry, almost like champagne.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Oh, is that the same stuff you brought to the beach?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Yeah, it's that same cider.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 It's not delicious.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 It's not very sugary.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 No, it's not sweet at all.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Yeah. Which is what I'm into.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 I remember you brought that whole case and I was like, "Oh, yeah, I like cider ale.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 I'll give this a shot." And I took a sip and I was like, "Yeah."

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 You would say.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 No, that stuff is, like you say dry, but has like bone dry.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 It's not dry. It's not refreshing.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 No, not at all.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 You're like more thirsty after a sip.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Yeah, don't drink this if you're playing volleyball on the beach.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 It's like the anti-cores late.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 But I fucking love it.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 So yeah, I got a bunch of this.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 And yeah, that's what we're drinking now.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 What are you drinking, Greg?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Water.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Life water.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Life water.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 You're drinking some salt too.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 What kind of salt are you?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Spin drift.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Spin drift is good.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 A real squeezed fruit.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Yep, that's it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 I mean, it actually has a raspberry lime.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 And calories.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Yeah.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Because that is actual juice in it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Yeah, that's the amount of fan.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 I like the lemon one.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 It's probably my favorite.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 I really dig it.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 I haven't tried it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 It's pretty good.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 I get it at Panera Bread.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Hey, man.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 I like my Panera.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Hey.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Sometimes you need an overpriced grilled cheese, you know?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 I swear the prices went up, but it's just me.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Like $14 fucking dollars.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Are you a member of the bread club?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 No.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Well, maybe you should join.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Do you see, is it saving money?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 I haven't joined.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 But they always look at me like I'm an asshole every time I'm there and I'm like, no.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 I'm like, oh, are you interested?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 No.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Okay.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Don't get a free apple every fucking month or something.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 And original content online.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Yeah, sometimes I want like a $10 grilled cheese, you know?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 I'm going to dip in my $8 cup of soup.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 [laughter]

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And feel like I'm being healthy for my lunch break.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 It's probably worse for you than like Taco Bell.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 [laughter]

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Oh, it'll come up.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Yeah, I'm kidding.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 This only has 3,000 calories in the soup.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 You saw the meme with the mac and cheese, right?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 But the boy, yeah, it's winning.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 It's just in a packet and the dude empties it into a thing and they act like it's scandal.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 But you're like, yeah, that's kind of what I expected.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 I don't think anyone's back there like, oh, shaving cheddar.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Right, right.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Yeah, it's a fast food chain.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 This isn't artisanal at all.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 No.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 [laughter]

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Their broccoli cheddar is not vegetarian.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 What?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Yeah.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Chicken stock.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 No, there's dicks.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 This woman, and I...

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 much respect her for doing this, I asked.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 I was like, is your broccoli cheddar, or I'm sorry, your broccoli potato or whatever it

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 is, cheddar broccoli, I don't remember what the fuck it is.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 It's one of those two.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 One of those things, yeah.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 It looked vegetarian on the menu, but it didn't have the V next to it.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 So I was like, is that vegetarian?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 She's like, I don't think so.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 It doesn't have the V. I said, right, that was my concern.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 I said, just curious, why isn't it vegetarian?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 And so she like asked these other two people near her.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 She asked her manager, nobody knew.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 So she comes back with this fucking binder.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 It is a giant book of everything that they serve in the entire ingredients list for it.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 So there's a line gathering behind me now.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And I'm just like, oh my god, lady.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 It wasn't just...

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 I'll take your word for it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 It's not vegetarian, but she's flipping, flipping, flipping through the book.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 And oh, here it is.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 And then she's scrolling down through the ingredients.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Chicken stock.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 I'm like, that'll do it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 I guess that's why I said vegetarian.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Thanks.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 It was just like, holy shit, it turned into like this giant like 10 minute ordeal.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Dude, it's fucking amazing to go through that much effort to not sell you something.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Yeah.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 That's fucking amazing.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 I'm like, I'm already not gonna buy it because I'm gonna err on this side of caution here.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 And I don't want to get diarrhea for, you know, the rest of my days.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 But no, she went the extra mile.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 For no money.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 No, I gave her a tip.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Oh, that's nice.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Was it like the Necronomicon like, bounding human flesh?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Could have been...

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 It was like a tome of just page after page.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Yeah, just the first time I've ever opened this.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 The other employees didn't know it existed.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 We'll get the good book.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Alter boys, bring it out.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Got candles and incense swinging.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Sorry, we've got a closest Panera for the next three hours.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 This ritual takes quite a while.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 People wanted us to talk about our setups.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 I don't know if we want to do that or not.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 We could always do it another time.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Yeah, I feel like mine's always in flux.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 It's kind of hard for me to discuss what exactly is going on.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 That's pretty stable now too, I think yours is too.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Yeah, I'm pretty happy with what I have and I don't think it's gonna change for a while

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 unless something comes out and is like, makes me change my mind or replaces something that I already have.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 But no, I like what I have.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 I'm super fucking stoked on my modulate lately.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 It is definitely the most satisfying that it's ever been.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 I don't know.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 It's like 13 modules and I love it more than anything I've ever had.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 Well, it sounds like you are.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 That's a good segue for you to just describe what's going on.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Yeah, I've got two things lately.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 The Bug brand crossover filter, which I really fucking like.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 And the Pittsburgh Voltage Lab, which I'm surprisingly happy with.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 I'll go into that.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 I'll start with the crossover filter, which I didn't really fully understand until I got it.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Because the cool thing about that, it's like a dual filter with resonance.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 And the Bug brand filter sound really fucking good to me.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 They're like nice and liquidy.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 I don't know.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 There's something about it that I really like.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 You can get acidy stuff that the DRM 2 really kind of highlighted for me.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Because that thing is an acid box as well as a percussion box really.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Kind of secretively in a way.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 But the crossover filter has three band outs.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 That's the whole thing.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.520
 He was like, oh yeah, people make like stereo crossover setups for like subwoofers and car

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.520
 stuff.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.520
 He's like, why don't I play with that?

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.520
 Like that's cool.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.000
 I can think of processing ideas like taking the low and the mids and the high out.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.840
 The coolest thing about it, I didn't realize this is another jack that's the mix out to

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.480
 the right of it that sums all of those.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.280
 And then when you take the levels for each of those bands, so you can basically have a

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.280
 filter sweep.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.280
 But as it goes into the mids, it's much louder.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.720
 Or you can just negate all the lows altogether or boost the highs.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.280
 So you can get these like really like fucking bulbous, I guess, in a way like sweep through

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.280
 the filter.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.760
 And it's like lots of lows, some mids and a little highs or like the opposite.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.080
 And you can CV that like the cutoff responses to it.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.960
 And it's just, it's really super interesting to me.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.960
 I'll go off the way it sounds.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:23.880
 I immediately sold my twin peak filter from Epoch Modular, the Rob Horneike filter, which

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:29.480
 I liked, but has always been kind of a kind of weird configuration to use the way like

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:35.240
 you cross fade both the signals and it's got like, it's just kind of awkward to do it.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.120
 And you can get to some dead spots.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.600
 And he kind of even referenced that filter.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.040
 And it's like, oh, you can't really like this is a little more easy to play.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.040
 And it is.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.040
 And it's got two huge like filter knobs.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.320
 Do you have control over the bands themselves?

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.800
 Do you have like the Q value?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800
 Good question.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.000
 You don't right now, but he has a passive expander that's coming out that's kind of small.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.200
 It'll be pretty inexpensive.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.120
 And in that case, you just have two separate stereo filters.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.040
 And then you have separate voltage control over the cutoff and the resonance for each

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.120
 one and then patchable outputs for each one.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.520
 So you can take the stereo processing even further because right now it kind of sums

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.400
 it to a mono signal, even though you've got two filters and you there's like a parallel

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.120
 and serial switch kind of like an access virus if you've used that.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.520
 So it's like really flexible, super easy to use.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.160
 And I definitely really dig it.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.280
 Does it have any like saturation capabilities?

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.280
 Yes.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.800
 It does have some built in his the way his standalone boxes work.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.760
 There's always a drive on the input and that thing can get really nice.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.120
 Now the DRM 2 has saturation types on the output.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.840
 It's like folding and saturation.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.840
 And that's cool.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.480
 You would have put that on the Cut-Off tube, but it would have just been a bigger different

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.480
 module.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.440
 But yeah, it can get nice and nasty or really clean.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.640
 When I had the PT delay for a while, I overdrew the hell out of that input a lot.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.800
 Sounded really good.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.800
 Yeah.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:05.880
 So again, another very satisfying bug brand purchase, Tom Bugs fucking kills it for sure.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.280
 And this has like CV.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.280
 Yeah.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.280
 Okay.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.280
 Right now you get just CV over each cut off for each filter, but that expander will give

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.080
 you the resonance too.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.320
 So it's just four inputs.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.200
 It's not well, two right now, then another two, but it's definitely enough.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.280
 And just sound quality super pleasing to me too.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.280
 Nice and rubbery kind of filtering.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.960
 It's like no on board modulation, right?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.640
 No, nope, you got a so I have it hooked up to the DRM 2 and then I have that converter

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.640
 box.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.640
 So I've been sending it voltage from the voltage lab, those slope generators on there, which

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.520
 I like and just the DRM 2 envelopes.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.000
 And then Zadar of course, because Zadar is always fucking with everybody.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.560
 It's like that bully that's like, I'm going to fuck you up, man.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.280
 I'm going to fuck your voltage inputs up.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.960
 No, that thing, you know, again, we've spoken about that ad nauseam, but it never gets

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960
 old.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.640
 I love the Zadar, been especially digging the LFO modes on it lately, which I think we

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.840
 talked about last time, but it's still true.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.840
 Yeah.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.040
 It sounds almost what I've been looking for in a filter bank lately.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.040
 You know what I mean?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.480
 If he would just blow that out a little bit more, offer like some on board, like envelope

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.480
 followers and like...

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.480
 That would be nice.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.480
 You know what I mean?

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480
 Yeah.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.920
 And maybe a saturation on the output or like a sub-divider circuit or something like that,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.080
 where you could just kind of turn it into not just a filter, but like a all-in-one self-modulating

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.320
 mangeller unit.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.000
 It's weird because he's been releasing the blue modules and he's been really quiet about

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.680
 it because he's just trying to serve the people that are trying to build those frames.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.160
 So it's like kind of even hidden on the site, he never announces it like the red one.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.520
 So the intent is kind of that you would get these things and then like, "Oh yeah, you

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.520
 want like dual shift register?

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.920
 I've got that module now."

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.920
 Or like envelope...

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.360
 I don't think he has an envelope follower, but he's kind of trickling that stuff out.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.120
 I'm not trying to get into the blue modules because it's just...

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.480
 It's even harder to get than LZX stuff or like some other boutique stuff where it's just

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.120
 like, "You're not.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.120
 Good luck.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.000
 It's hard enough to get the red ones."

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 But I think it's one of those things where he'll work with you.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.560
 Like I know I'm going to get one of the frames like the cases he makes for the module, but

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.880
 just to put...

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.640
 I want two different configurations of all the red shit I have.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:19.320
 I want the DRM 2 and the crossover filter and one of the PEQ filters in a box and then

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.120
 another the compressor.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.600
 Oh, that's right.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.880
 Actually I want the compressor and two PEQs and then the bug brand filter, the expander

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.480
 and the DRM 2.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.480
 Like two separate little portable mini skits.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.080
 That'll be pretty sweet.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.080
 Nice.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.080
 Wow.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.080
 Yeah.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.000
 Like one stereo processing and one just kind of like all his sound generation stuff that

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 I have.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 That sounds like fun.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Yeah.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 It is.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.320
 It's really enjoyable stuff to use.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.880
 It's never cramped.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.040
 I like banana jacks.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.640
 I didn't realize the other day.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.440
 Like they don't click when you insert them.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.560
 There's never like, you know in your own like Jack and it'll make a click with banana.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.560
 It's real subtle.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.280
 You can actually just kind of sit it there on top of it and modulate like touch it and

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.720
 be like, "Oh, do I like that modulation?"

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720
 Yeah.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.720
 Put it in.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.360
 A lot of the circuit bent stuff I've owned over the years has all been banana.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.040
 Like the BPMC mixer that was all banana jack.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:18.080
 The circuit bent Kawai drum machine I had that was all banana jack too.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.080
 I forgot about that.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.280
 I missed that thing a lot.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.280
 Yeah.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.280
 Yeah.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.280
 I had that thing and I had the circuit bent radio shack reverb.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.280
 Oh, that's great.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.800
 And that was like a powerful combo and I missed it.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:37.760
 I auctioned them off as like kickstarter rewards back in the day when we were doing the fundraiser

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.960
 for the Prometheus album Displacement Disorder.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.160
 And I've kind of been kicking myself in the ass for doing that ever since.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.560
 I was like, "Yeah, this will be a great reward."

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.600
 And it was like people enjoyed it and I'm like, "Fuck."

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.440
 Why did I give it away?

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.800
 Well, you know who has it.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.800
 I, yeah.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.440
 I mean, I could look them up.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.440
 Take a little trip.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.440
 Yeah.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.400
 And smash the window.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.760
 Hopefully they're a fan of this podcast.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.960
 I'm listening right now.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.880
 And the dude that did those bends doesn't even exist anymore.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880
 I forget who it was.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.640
 It was like alien tech or something like that.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.640
 Or alien devices.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.640
 Yeah.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.640
 He doesn't even bend things anymore.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.200
 But that was some like top notch stuff, man.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.680
 Like, especially that radio shack verb.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.440
 Like that was probably one of the best distortion boxes I ever had.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.000
 Like that thing would just get so nasty.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.400
 Did he ever put out the schematics of his bends?

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.400
 I don't think so.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.800
 Because it'd be cool to just be able to make your own.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.800
 Yeah.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.400
 But it was a very specific model.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.400
 Oh, man.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.640
 It was the metal version and it had like, it was like a really nice case.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.640
 Yeah, that's what I had.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.640
 You had one of those things.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.640
 I didn't have a bent.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.800
 It was only a high head intended to bend.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.200
 I was like, "Uh, I don't want to fuck this up."

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.400
 Because whenever I was bending stuff, it was always like, "Well, I could fuck this up,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.000
 so I'm going to go get a $5 toy and start from there."

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.080
 But this was like, I was getting use out of it.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.440
 I haven't been able, I was tempted to try and do my own bends with one of those, but

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.640
 I can't find one of those anymore.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.640
 The only ones I find are like the really cheap plastic ones.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.640
 Yeah.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.640
 Those are kind of ass.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.080
 They were never that good to begin with.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.920
 No, and they don't sound good, even just out of the box.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.920
 Right.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.040
 I don't know what the difference is between the two, but there's definitely something

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.360
 more than just the box.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.080
 Like there's some different circuitry going on in the metal ones.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.160
 Yeah, the dude even said it when I bought it.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.720
 You know, this is a rare version of this.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.680
 You know, he said he blew it out with like every bend possible.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.440
 He's like, "You really want to hold on to this?

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.440
 Don't just give it a say."

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440
 Yeah, this is priceless.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.440
 Yeah.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.440
 One of a kind of advice.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.440
 Cool, cool.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.440
 I'm listening, man.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.440
 You know what I'm going to do?

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.440
 I'm going to give this away.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.160
 I just hope it's in a good home.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.160
 That's all I can say.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.160
 Yeah.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.160
 But yeah, banana jacks.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.320
 That's what I had to do, if I recall.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:54.640
 What doesn't have banana jacks is the voltage research lab, which I won't go super in-depth

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.160
 too, if you want to know what it does and see the specs you can search it online.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.240
 But I'll highlight on some of the things I like.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.960
 Also, you're not going to get one.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.960
 Oh, good.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:08.080
 I was going to say one place to start might be talk about your expectations first.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.080
 Yeah.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.320
 So I went there one day to Pittsburgh Modular and played around with it because I looked

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.440
 at it and was like, "Okay, this looks interesting to me.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.120
 You know, it's got this oscillator that I don't quite understand.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.160
 It's all Michael Johnson design, basically.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.200
 Richard helped with the design, but it's Michael's circuits.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.320
 It's his beast, basically.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.680
 And I played with it there and I was getting some sounds that I didn't expect.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.240
 And I was like, "Oh, that oscillator.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.400
 I could see using this for some music."

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.920
 It wasn't.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.200
 They had their microvolt and I was not a fan of that when I used it personally.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.360
 There's nothing wrong with it.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.480
 It just didn't sound like what I wanted it to sound like.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.920
 I didn't like the design.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.920
 And they had that big life-forms voice.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.880
 And I feel like that was another one that I saw that.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.880
 I was like, "This is cool."

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.000
 And I was like, "There's nothing really distinct or unique about it."

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Right.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.440
 So I went there to use it and I was kind of into it.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.680
 And I realized I wasn't as into the touch keyboard because it's like a two, if not three-part

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.680
 thing.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.120
 There's the case, the module, the touch keyboard, and then there's the output module you get

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.120
 for free.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.120
 And I was like, "Okay.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.480
 I don't really want the case.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.240
 The touch keyboard isn't my thing."

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.400
 And they kind of modeled it after a Bucula music easel.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.720
 They're like, "We're going to make an affordable version of this with our own stuff."

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.560
 And I'm like, "Cool, cool."

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.560
 So we got the module.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.560
 There's Kickstarter.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.560
 All the panels got messed up.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.960
 They had to get it redone, delayed it by almost a month or something and some change.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.240
 So that sucked for them.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.280
 But I got it and realized very quickly it's all about the dual oscillator on there.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.800
 So the whole secret sauce is that Michael Johnson came up with a way to quote-unquote

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:43.160
 "wavefold" high harmonic signals without making it sound like shit with just pure noise.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.040
 So you found a way to kind of zoom in on the waveform for what I remember him and Richard

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.520
 saying and fold that stuff.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.520
 So it's got multiple stages.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.520
 There's a lot of circuitry.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.880
 It takes like 450 milliamps of power.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880
 It's a really shit.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.880
 It's an absolute piece.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.360
 And it's entirely analog?

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.360
 Yeah.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.600
 It's all analog.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.320
 One thing I really like about it too is that it's not normal at all.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.960
 You have to patch everything on it, which is cool because it's like, "Oh, I've just added

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.400
 like two slope generators, two filters and this dual oscillator that I can -- if I'm

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.040
 not using it in the patch, I can use it for other stuff," which is cool instead of something

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.480
 that's like, "Oh yeah, that envelope's triggering because it's getting a gimbal."

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.520
 It's all about the dual oscillator in short and that wave folding stuff.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.600
 I've been getting sounds out of it that I just can't explain and haven't been able

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.600
 to expect.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.680
 And that's where the magic is in my opinion.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.000
 The filters you can buy as a module.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Okay.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.720
 It's -- I live the same as the other Michael Johnson design filter that impulse filter

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.720
 where he did.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.000
 He simulated a low-pass gate without back trolls.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 And it's cool.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.280
 It sounds good, but it's -- the dual oscillator is just kind of the magic to me.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.640
 The slope generators are cool.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.400
 It amazingly has blue LEDs that don't make me want to throw it off a cliff.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.400
 It is.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400
 That's the first thing.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.400
 It is.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400
 You know me.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.120
 Like I've talked about this before in my blue LED thing, but these don't bug me.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.440
 And I like that it's black.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:13.920
 It's not the beige kind of style that they were doing, which never -- it's a dark module.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.120
 And I'm just impressed with how much I've been enjoying it.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.520
 And using the MIDI interface because I just take my MIDI box to the hair mod module now

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.520
 to that.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.680
 And it's -- you can do all sorts of shit with it.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.680
 So.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.240
 Now if they ever just released the oscillator part, do you think that would be worth it?

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.480
 Oh, I think they should.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.480
 Okay.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.480
 Yeah.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.640
 Because they've got a number of oscillators, even analog oscillators over the years.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.200
 And they had that complex one because I remember it had the very strange blade.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.840
 Oh, the double helix.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.840
 Yeah.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.840
 Yeah.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.680
 Because I don't know if I really want to get all that other stuff necessarily.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.680
 Yeah.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.400
 I think about that often when I use it, I'm like, oh, they claim that they're probably

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.000
 not going to make anymore.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.920
 It was a Kickstarter they made what they made.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.920
 It was successful.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.080
 They made, you know, it completed it.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.640
 And they're like, I don't know if we're going to keep making these.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.920
 But I think they should do the dual oscillator.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.080
 I think it's worth it.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.720
 I think it's kind of just some Michael Johnson brilliance in there for sure.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720
 Yeah.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.080
 It just sounds great period outside of that.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.600
 You know, I don't really give a fuck who made it in a way.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.680
 But I would like the sounds from it.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.880
 I don't see myself getting rid of it.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.880
 Yeah.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.960
 I think I got a little disheartened after the microvolt.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.960
 Yeah.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.520
 And I was kind of like, not to write them off entirely, but I was just like, oh, yeah.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.400
 So it's kind of cool that they're still coming up with interesting ways to make that happen.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400
 That's what I thought too.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.720
 I didn't really expect to get much more analog stuff at all.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.960
 But those two, the filter in that module, I'm definitely psyched on for sure.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.520
 And I've got more wave table stuff than anyone should have at this point.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.520
 Which I'm not mad at.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.760
 I've been clearing space to make room for more of that.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.760
 Oh, anything particular that you got your eye?

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.760
 The hydrosense.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.320
 Oh, oh, wait, clearance space like on your desk.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.320
 Yep.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.840
 That's what that big hole there is for.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.920
 See, I thought you meant clearance space in your rack.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:08.320
 I'm for, yeah, I'm kind of welcoming, not needing to clear up space in my modular for

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.320
 something for once.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320
 You know what I mean?

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.920
 I was like, you know what?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.280
 I can have all this outside of my rig finally.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.160
 You've got all this table space now.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.560
 You can fucking use it.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.560
 Spread out.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.560
 I'm not used to it.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.560
 So I haven't spread out yet.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.560
 Right, right.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560
 You're all cramped up.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.560
 Yeah.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.560
 Yeah.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.560
 Yeah.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.560
 Yeah.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.560
 Spread your wings and fly, Greg.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.560
 Yeah.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.560
 Yeah.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.560
 Can you get that thing yet?

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.560
 No.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.560
 And it got delayed.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.560
 Could you have gone at knob gone?

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.560
 No.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.560
 Okay.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.840
 Because it seemed like the one I was using and playing with was ready to go.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.840
 If you can work.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.840
 Yeah.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:43.840
 It was, and it was like, and it was not like prototype case.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.840
 It was like people have them.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.080
 Oh, like review models and shit.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.080
 Yeah.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080
 Supposedly.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.500
 And like there was a lot of people on the forums kind of upset about this because like

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:58.960
 a lot of people got some who did, I guess to do like demos or presets, whatever, like

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.360
 like Nick at Sonic State.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.600
 For example, he had one months ago, did a full on review.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.760
 And like at the time when people were doing these initial reviews, they were saying it

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.960
 was supposed to be out like now.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.840
 Like I think early November was like the tentative deadline.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.560
 Then they shipped it or then they bumped it up to late December.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.760
 Now people are saying that they don't think they're even going to get it before the turn

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.760
 of the year.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.760
 Yeah.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.320
 Is there any I've not been following it have the manufacturers been talking about what

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.360
 the delay is or what's going on?

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.880
 There was a lot of speculation on the forums that I've been seeing, but I didn't see anything

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.880
 like official.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.720
 It's a little weird to be that quiet, especially when you're like a small new.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720
 Yeah.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720
 Company.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:45.480
 I know Daniel Troberg of Electron left Electron took Haidis and then became the VP of the

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.480
 Hydrocinthe Company.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.480
 Oh yeah.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.200
 So he kind of runs engineering at least or something like that.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.560
 Have they done anything previously?

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.000
 They're called like AMS, right?

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.760
 Yeah, I don't think they've done anything else.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.760
 The name here is.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.560
 Yeah, I'm sorry, ASM.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.560
 ASM.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.280
 I think it's a Chinese company making its first year or something like that.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.280
 Interesting.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.920
 I mean, it definitely has my attention.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.800
 Like I kind of stuck my nose up at it at knob con.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.800
 You know what I mean?

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.960
 Like it was right across from like the Waldorf booth.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.120
 And I was like, "Wow, who are these amateurs?"

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.120
 I did not.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.360
 I walked over and played with it.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.360
 It was fucking astounding.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.520
 Yeah, it sounded good.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.520
 It sounded good.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.760
 And it was also like, I started playing with it and I groced it in a couple of seconds.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.000
 I genuinely thought they were first sale there.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.640
 I left with the idea of looking at it up later.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.040
 Yeah, I think a lot of people have had the same impression over the last few months.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.520
 Like the way they've been promoting it and the date that was out there and the fact

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.560
 that people had some of the review, a lot of people bought them thinking they would be

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.560
 out in a month.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.560
 Yeah.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.560
 And so far it's been months now.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.240
 And possibly a few more.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.760
 Some little bum to buy that.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.520
 I think it might be something worth waiting for.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.520
 Yeah.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.520
 Just from the experience I had and then seeing other videos of it.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:59.320
 If they put it together well and basically stick to the design that they had in September.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.840
 Fuck yeah, there's a ton of good stuff in it.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.840
 Is there on?

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.840
 799 for the desktop.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.840
 Oh shit.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.840
 Yeah, that's not bad.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.560
 Less than half the price of like a TI virus or a Waldorf chira.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.560
 Wow.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.400
 I already thought it sounds very comparable.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.920
 I would guess like 1400 bucks or something.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.920
 Yeah.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.520
 The keyboard version I think is 1200 which is still cheaper than your average virus,

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520
 you know what I mean?

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.520
 Yeah.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.520
 Things like that.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.360
 But the Jupiter XM is like 1500 bucks.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.360
 Wow.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.360
 Yeah.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.120
 It has keypads.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.960
 Like all the pads that are in front of it.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.120
 I think it has 28 pads or something.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.120
 2824 or something like that.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.600
 And you can put it in keyboard mode and sequence that way.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.080
 You know, that's pretty cool.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.080
 Yeah.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.360
 That was one of the main selling points for me.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.400
 Plus I saw it has CV inputs and all that jazz.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.600
 I'm like, okay, I can definitely integrate this with the modular.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.600
 You know what I mean?

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.160
 It's just going to be like an external giant wave table oscillator for me.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:09.280
 You know, and it's got like each part is three oscillators, which is pretty cool.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.280
 And each oscillator has 219 waveforms.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.920
 And then there's five ADSR envelopes.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920
 Damn.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.360
 Yeah, there's shit.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.840
 There's all kinds of effects.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.880
 Four different reverbs, five different delays.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.840
 Chorus, flanger, rotary, phaser, lo-fi, tremolo, EQ and compressor.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.440
 I mean, it sounds like they kind of went for the virus.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.920
 Virus those five-

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920
 Exactly.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.920
 All those effects.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.920
 Yeah.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.920
 They're like, access isn't going to do it.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920
 They might as well.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.920
 And probably it's going to work, you know?

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920
 Yeah.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.920
 I mean, every demo that I've listened to so far sounds great.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.280
 You know, like criticism I've been seeing really is that it's an unknown company for

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.600
 the most part.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.320
 And a lot of people are saying it's just a VST and a box, but it's like, it's sows the

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320
 virus.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.320
 You know what I mean?

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.320
 So is most Waldorf stuff.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.600
 Yeah, as long as it sounds good, it doesn't really mean anything.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.600
 You know, it's like, and I don't want to be in the box.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.760
 So having something outside of the computer that can function like something in the computer

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.560
 isn't a downside to me.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560
 You know what I mean?

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.400
 Somebody made mention the other day and this is related that the Waldorf quantum, like,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.680
 do you think that's more than just an iPad in there?

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.680
 Right.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.680
 Because it is like, it's a touch screen.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.680
 It's not an iPad.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.680
 Sure.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680
 Like, maybe that's all it is.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.680
 It's a fucking VST in a box.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680
 What a touch screen.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.320
 But I mean, interface is important.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.320
 I don't know.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.040
 I prefer to have everything laid out, you know, and it doesn't look that menu-divey.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.040
 The decibels.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.040
 No, like, yeah.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.040
 No, it was not at all.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.920
 I mean, there was a couple of things that like you would dive, but it was maybe one

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.920
 or two deep.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.920
 Yeah, I thought the Cairo's slower to get started when I was demoing it than the Hydro

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.000
 Santa, where it was like, "Oh shit, there it is."

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Yeah.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.560
 And on the opposite end, the more Cairo samples and videos, I hear the last time into it.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.560
 Really?

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.560
 I've never seen it since.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:04.080
 It has less polyphony than like the Cairo and the virus, but it has more than I need.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.080
 You know what I mean?

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.080
 It's like eight part.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.080
 Oh, it's eight part?

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.080
 Yeah.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.080
 Nice.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.600
 That's what I'd care about more than the polyphony, you know, as long as I can get a

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.120
 couple voices out of each.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.520
 Hell, even just one sometimes.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.040
 So what else was on our list?

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.800
 Industrial music electronics.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.800
 Yes.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.800
 Bionic Lester Mark III.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.720
 Part two.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.680
 Nothing, nothing but praise.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.080
 I fucking love it.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.080
 I got rid of...

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.720
 I think we both did.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.280
 I mean, I got rid of a Polaris.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.840
 I got a Roo-3 Polaris.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.840
 All right, you win.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.600
 That's only contest, but you win.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.480
 And I don't regret it for a second.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.600
 I seriously don't miss it.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.520
 The Polaris at all.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.520
 Yeah.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.200
 Bionic Lester Mark III.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.280
 It has eight presets.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.960
 It's dual filter, multi-mode, digital filter.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.960
 I was just burping.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.960
 I'm just covering it.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.960
 Seriously, they're trying to be polite.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.920
 They're like, oh, God, he's just trying to be polite.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:15.360
 And you can have it either in serial, A going into B. You can have A controlling, both

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:22.000
 A and B with B. The cutoff is an offset of that.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 There's just a stereo.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.640
 And so each of the inputs have their own gain.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:34.080
 If you go past 12 o'clock, you start going into overdrive, which sounds fucking astounding.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.040
 I got a huge fan of that.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.640
 The resonance is super-tweaky, especially when you get up into...

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:45.120
 I think it was you, Nick, who said last time that he added last minute the comb and all

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.120
 pass.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.120
 Yeah.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.120
 Yeah.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.920
 Oh, fucking sounds amazing.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.920
 Sounds about band pass?

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.920
 Yeah.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.920
 Yeah.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.360
 And you can sweep between them and that's CVable.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.960
 Oh, between the types?

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.960
 Yeah.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.960
 You can sweep.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.960
 Yeah.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.760
 And they're not discrete, so you're kind of like morphing between them?

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.760
 Yeah, it's morphing.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.760
 Yeah.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.760
 Yeah.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.760
 Yeah.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.360
 That's, I guess, I overlooked the morphing aspect of this is that you don't just sort

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.120
 of go from one mode to the next discreetly.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:18.080
 It's a smooth, weird blend and sending that CV and just letting that sort of like go

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.480
 through the different modes.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.480
 Fucking great.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.960
 And it's got a screen for enough stuff for you to save presets, load presets.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:31.840
 And it gives you a pretty quick overview of where you're at, a little bar for, you know,

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.200
 resonance and where the frequency is at.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.200
 Oh, that's cool.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.760
 Now, does a preset, like with a preset are you pre-setting between morphs or does a preset

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:46.200
 contain like a preset locks in exactly what the parameters are at that time.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.520
 And you can make multiple presets and then CV morph through the presets.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.520
 Yeah.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.520
 Yeah.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.720
 And while you're doing that, still have control over the knobs.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.720
 Yeah.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.800
 So as you're morphing and doing all of this stuff, you can still then keep tweaking.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.080
 And now at that point, at least my experience so far, I don't, you know, this is relatively

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.080
 new.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.200
 It's chaos when you're doing that.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.760
 But I, like, I'm pretty sure like if you spend some time and really like you can dial in

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.440
 something pretty musical with it.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.440
 Yeah.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.440
 Yeah.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.600
 You said pretty much the basics that I had jotted down for too.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.080
 I've been enjoying the shit out of it since I got it.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.960
 Oh, is it like smooth the morphing?

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960
 Yes.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.440
 Like he was saying, like it's not like you're in low pass now or now you're in band pass.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:36.120
 Like on the Polaris, it's, there's this weird nebulous realm between the modes where it kind

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.040
 of fades in from like a low pass to a band pass to on and on.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:47.360
 Yeah, the modes in this order, because I jotted them down, goes from low pass to band pass

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:55.480
 to high pass to notch to all pass and then comb as the final domain.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.920
 And honestly, like the comb filter, I know it was like a last minute edition that he

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:08.720
 mentioned, I feel like he really broke some new ground with that.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.720
 Yeah.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.720
 It's amazing.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.200
 Like the dimension that it can go through, you know what I mean from like super tight,

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.600
 you know, like car plus type stuff to like almost delay territory.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:27.520
 You know, I mean, it's pretty wide range on the comb mode and it, the comb filter has

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.600
 two types of feedback too, that's got the negative and the positive.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.360
 And when you have it all the way to negative, it kind of like stops.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.600
 So you can almost use it as like a weird VCA almost.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.440
 Yeah, it's really weird.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.880
 Well, but it's just weird sort of like squashed feeling.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.200
 Like it doesn't have like a VCA, we just turn the volume down.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:52.520
 It feels like you've just like, like you've suffocated a flame.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.520
 Yeah.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.680
 And then you just kind of like, you just like, that was the perfect description.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.200
 Because that is how it feels.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.040
 Cause and then you just sit there and like you just are patching modulation into it.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.320
 And there's a ton of modulation.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.320
 Yeah.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.280
 Like all of the spots that you would want and including like Greg said, the preset.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.280
 Yeah.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.520
 This is a plus.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.120
 I love the layout of it.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.400
 When I saw it, I'm like, Oh shit, you can look at it and just like, all right, I get

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.400
 kind of how it works.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.400
 He really simplified it.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.400
 Yeah.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.400
 And there's some of his earlier stuff because I know the mark two is definitely a lot different.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.320
 Um, via the bug brand crossover filter and that dropped on the same day.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.000
 And that was definitely conflicted.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.720
 I'm like, I gotta move on this.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.960
 Like if I want this filter, I gotta do it now because they're sold out.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.960
 Yeah.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.960
 And I want it for that.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.400
 But there were a few moments where I'm like, I heard this, I saw the demo.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.520
 Like, and I knew you guys were going to get them.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.640
 So I was like, all right, I'll just wait to see what they're going to say.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.680
 I'm sorry if we're, if we're, if we're making that conflict even worse.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.920
 Hey, even the, um, like the preset manager, it's a tiny screen.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:56.200
 You got to like hit, push the button down and then hit the other button to like do the,

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.560
 the secondary menu.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.840
 It was, it's pretty intuitive.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.840
 Yeah.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.360
 You can definitely disregard the screen all together.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.360
 Yeah.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360
 But it is nifty.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.640
 I've noticed like a few touches too.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:10.840
 Like, um, it'll light up whenever you like have the feedback all the way off on the comb

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.800
 filter and then it'll kind of turn on whenever you reach that certain threshold and things

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.440
 like, uh, I don't know.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.440
 It's nice.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.440
 You know what I mean?

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.720
 Like, it's a nice touch.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.320
 You know, it doesn't need to be there.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.160
 It's, it's nice that it is there.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.360
 I guess at the beginning of the, before we started recording, I made the comment that

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:33.640
 if you're looking for something clean, I can, I couldn't find a clean filter in that.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.640
 I'm not looking for that.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.640
 So it's not a big deal.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.640
 Greg, you disagreed.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.800
 Um, I mean, I feel like it gets pretty clean.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:45.400
 Like it has from zero to 12 is the clean territory on the gaming.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.400
 Yeah.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.400
 Yeah.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.400
 On the input.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.000
 Digital VCAs from zero to 12.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.400
 Uh, it's, it's kind of clean.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.720
 The minute you go past 12, a little indicator that pop on the screen and that designates

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:03.080
 that you've entered clipping and it starts out in soft clipping and then like around,

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:08.080
 I think like, I don't know, three, four o'clock, you start hitting hard clipping, you know,

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.520
 all the way till it's maxed out.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.400
 Um, it's an instrument.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.320
 It's an interesting type of saturation.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.320
 You know what I mean?

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.600
 It's definitely digital, it doesn't sound like a, like an analog amp, you know what

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.600
 I mean?

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.400
 It's definitely like a digital crunch, but it's not muddy either.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.120
 Like it has a lot of, it seems like a lot of headroom in there and it's still clean

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.400
 even at it's like max, you know what I mean?

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.400
 Position.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.400
 Yeah.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.800
 Um, it's still, you can still tell what the source material is and depending on where

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:41.960
 you are, uh, in that saturation range and what mode you're in and what your resonance

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.000
 is at, it behaves differently.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 You know what I mean?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.920
 It kind of sounds like it's just breaking apart, but it's stable and there's no clicking either.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.480
 Like it even says it in the manual, like it's, it's a, the type of digital VCA where

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.840
 there's like, um, oh, the zero.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.840
 Zero points.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.840
 Yeah.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.840
 Yeah.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.840
 That's awesome.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.240
 So yeah, it sounds good even at when it's at it's like nastiest.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.760
 Um, I know that's not clean.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:11.560
 I guess for me, I was talking clean in the sense of like, I went from a Polaris to this

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.680
 you're in your right, the multi out on the Polaris always had some character to it.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.080
 Like there was always something, but there, there was always that clean option.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:24.080
 If you, if you just wanted to use a filter in an almost like scientific academic way,

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.240
 a Polaris would work.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.480
 Like you do the sort of clean cuts.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.400
 And this, I was like, even when I had the gain below 12 still felt there was always

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.440
 just like that little bit of teeth to it.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.440
 Mm hmm.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.840
 Um, which I'm, yeah, I don't think that's a downside, but a listener who's on the fence

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:45.320
 about it and wants also that option, this may not be the filter for them.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:52.400
 I feel like almost all the harvest men, or I'm sorry, IME modules have that, that kind

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.400
 of like noise to it.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.400
 You know what I mean?

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:59.120
 Even at it's clean to state, there's always that like, like the piston, for example, always

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.560
 has that like, that breath to it.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.560
 You know what I mean?

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.560
 Even when you're doing something clean, the indoor had the same thing.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.560
 Yeah.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:13.360
 Even if you had just the VCA and you weren't using the digital, um, the Mark 1.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.360
 The Mark 1, yeah.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.360
 I'm sorry, yeah.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.360
 I was talking about the Mark 1.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.040
 If you were just using the VCA without any of the digital envelopes, it was noticeably

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:25.560
 different than like a VCA that was trying to go for like this perfect pristine sound.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.560
 Mm hmm.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.360
 It always had just a little something to it, which again, I loved.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.360
 I thought it was great.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:36.160
 There's a way with the buttons to actually make it, uh, cable-less to go in, uh, series.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160
 Oh, shit.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.160
 Wait, do you go in series?

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.160
 Wait, what do you mean?

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.160
 Like A through B.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.840
 Yeah, that's what, yeah, that's the, the, the, the, the, the A control, then the series

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.760
 control and then the stereo control.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.160
 You had the little thing and that's what the link mode.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.160
 Yeah.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.160
 What button is?

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.160
 Yeah.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.160
 Oh, it does stereo.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.160
 Yeah.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.160
 I guess it does that.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.160
 Oh, okay.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.160
 Yeah.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.160
 That's sweet.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.160
 But I, I don't know what you're talking about.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.160
 Yeah.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.160
 I thought it would be, you know what I mean?

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.160
 Oh.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.160
 I'm like doing it manually.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.160
 I don't really.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.160
 I read the manual.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.160
 Yeah, I didn't.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.160
 I did not.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.160
 Yeah.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.160
 I thought you meant there was a hidden mode that I didn't know about.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.160
 No, I just mean like-

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.160
 That would be cool.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.160
 Yeah.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.160
 I'm sure there is.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.280
 Um, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if there's something hidden in there.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.440
 I, I kind of wish, like I have no complaints about it.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.440
 I think it's great.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.960
 Um, but I do miss a couple things about my Polaris that I could do with like, like,

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.760
 just the changing of the poles, you know what I mean?

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.760
 Yeah.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.360
 And the steepness of it.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.080
 This being a digital filter, I kind of wish he would have built that in there because

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.240
 it seems like that would, that could be possible.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.240
 You know what I mean?

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:46.000
 I know you can stack the two and go into four pole mode, but it would be nice to just be

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.160
 like able to hit a button for each filter and have it go through like two, four, eight,

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.160
 you know, poles, whatever.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.160
 Right, right.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.160
 Increase the steepness of it.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.760
 So it's two pole, twelve.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.760
 Yeah.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.760
 Yeah.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.760
 Unless you stack them.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.760
 Right.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:06.280
 But yeah, that, that's kind of like only minor critique of it so far.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.040
 But yeah, I'm definitely digging it.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.120
 Um, and it's just a nice change of pace.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.120
 You know what I mean?

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.440
 You get kind of used to like the same type of analog filterness and then all of a sudden

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.880
 you have something that's like digital and crunchy and strange.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:24.360
 You know, you know, yeah, and the comb filter like, like I was already sold on it at knob

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.440
 con before he even introduced that, you know what I mean?

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:31.920
 And like having one known playing with that mode, it's like, holy shit, like he could

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.400
 have just showed me that mode and I probably would have bought it.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.400
 You know what I mean?

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:40.440
 Like, I can see myself getting a lot of use out of that as like a strange manger.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.440
 What do you get?

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.440
 CV over?

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.440
 You get CV over the cut off.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.440
 Cut off.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:48.600
 Resin, well, so the CV one is always cut off.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.600
 Yeah.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.440
 And then CV two and three are assignable.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.440
 Oh, nice.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.440
 You can route them wherever you want.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.440
 Yeah.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.960
 Which is really, which is super nice.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:01.520
 Um, honestly, like that little filter bank module that I got, I kind of want a few more

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.160
 of those for utility purposes.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:09.120
 Like they're cheap and you can get more surgical with it, you know, for our listeners at home.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.360
 What the fuck are you talking about?

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.160
 I don't know what the fuck it is.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.120
 It's got the phase symbol on it.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.720
 Yeah, I don't, I can look it up.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.720
 I got it on reverb.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.480
 Oh, wait, that's not the animal factory one.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.480
 No, because I saw you.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.480
 Okay.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.480
 It's in between the animal factory.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.480
 Okay.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.480
 But it's not.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.720
 I really was intended that to be a smoother segue.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.320
 And I was not putting on the spot.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.520
 Uh, so wait, when you ordered it, did you have a name?

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.520
 Yeah.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.800
 I just don't remember what it was.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.800
 Oh, okay.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.800
 It was one of those things where like I just hopped on modular grid and I was like, I

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.920
 want the small filter bank, you know, and I started looking through them and most of

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.960
 them were not small at all.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.120
 Most of them were fucking gigantic.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.760
 And I was like, that kind of defeats the purpose.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.520
 I could just keep a Polaris or something.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.520
 Yeah.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:55.320
 So I wanted to find something that was comparable in size, but like also not real expensive or,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.120
 you know, nothing, all that crazy.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:01.920
 I just wanted to straight up, you know, multiple band pass filters that I could get a little

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.000
 surgical on certain things with.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.240
 And I stumbled upon that thing and I was like, I don't know what this is, googled it, saw

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.840
 a couple like results about getting kits for it and found one that was available on reverb.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.840
 So it's like, all right, I just jumped on it.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.840
 You know, it wasn't that expensive.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.680
 So I was like, you know, I'll take a, I'll take a leap here.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.000
 And so far I'm digging it.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:29.840
 It's not like the surge resonant EQ or anything, nearly that nice sounding, but it does what

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.520
 it, you know, the trick.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.440
 What do you imagine yourself using it for?

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.240
 Were you to keep it feedback patching?

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.400
 Okay.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.240
 Most likely, which is also what I did with the resonant.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240
 Q.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.240
 Holy shit.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.400
 You don't have the resonant EQ anymore.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.400
 Yeah.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.400
 I couldn't justify the size anymore, dude.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.400
 Like big boy.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.400
 Yeah.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.800
 For what I was doing with it, I was like, this is way too much rack space.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.080
 So I parted with it once again.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.400
 I'll probably regret it again.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.400
 You can get them.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.400
 Yeah.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.400
 Yeah.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.400
 I have one that I still haven't built.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.400
 Really?

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.600
 Yeah, the random source kit.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.600
 Yeah.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.400
 That's smaller, but even that one's still fucking big too, you know?

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.400
 It's pretty big.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.000
 It's compared to this 20 HP.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.400
 I think that one is like eight.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.400
 Eight HP.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.400
 That was like eight.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.400
 Yeah.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.800
 But I know this is kind of like completely useless to listen.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.800
 I'm like telling them what it is.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.800
 Yeah.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:25.960
 But we should say that there's a logo on the front that looks like a, like a not sign.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.960
 A face symbol.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:28.960
 Yeah.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.960
 Give me one second.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.680
 I can probably find it on.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680
 [Music]

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:46.080
 To get us back on track.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.960
 All we were discussing this, I looked up the module name.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.960
 Thank God.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.960
 We'll segue back in.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:51.960
 What is it?

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.960
 They'll never know.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.120
 I don't know how to pronounce it.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.600
 Ant-tombra bank.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.600
 Oh.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.600
 I thought so.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.600
 That's the duty mix.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.000
 The mini elements and the mini clouds.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 Oh, is it?

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 Yeah.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 Yeah.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 Okay.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 All right.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.240
 The mini marbles with the tiny mini pots, which just okay.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.480
 Yeah, which I wish I could get into.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.480
 But yeah.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.960
 Every time I look at them, I'm like, that's just way too cramped.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.520
 Like one reason why I like marbles is the, yeah.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.520
 Yeah.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.520
 And the elements too.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.520
 Like holy shit.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.520
 That would be such a mess.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.520
 Oh yeah.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.000
 It's like a great mini pots up top.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 It's not interesting.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Not interesting.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 A rough ride.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 Nah.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.800
 I'll just do without, if that's my only option.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.480
 How long have you had this?

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.480
 Uh, two days.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.200
 Oh, this is brand fucking now.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.200
 Yeah, brand.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.200
 Oh, that.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200
 It was just impulse buy.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.200
 Nothing fancy.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.520
 I didn't even plan on talking about it really because I like, haven't really dove into it.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.520
 You know what I mean?

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.520
 Yeah.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:45.520
 It's nothing fancy.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.440
 And the build is kind of a little bit janky on some of the pots.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.080
 But I don't know if this was a pro build directly from them or if this is somebody's

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.320
 personal kit.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.320
 Mm hmm.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.440
 So yeah, quality could be a little bit better.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.160
 But I, uh, I'm just worried about it, are you?

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.160
 Not really.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.600
 You know, it's doing, it's working.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.600
 You know, I've tested everything.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.720
 I've tested all the frequencies and already started doing some feedback patches through

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.680
 it and things like that.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.600
 So it's doing the job.

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.600
 Oh.

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.520
 That's something I would recommend though.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.520
 Yeah.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.520
 Fair enough.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:21.840
 I feel like there needs to be a better option for something like this still with CV functionality.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.760
 I was going to ask if it doesn't have CV does it?

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.760
 No, sir.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.760
 Okay.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.760
 Yeah.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.920
 I think there's like an amplified input, a flat input, a mix out, a low band out and a

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:30.920
 high band out.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.640
 But for feedback, I could see, you know, I could see the joint there.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.680
 Now I am, I do see this between two animal factory modules.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.680
 Yes, sir.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.680
 Yeah.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:48.280
 What's up with those was like something I ran into completely on accident.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.560
 So I was like digging through different filter banks and distortion stuff.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:44:00.120
 Cause I was like, I kind of want to build a new network of like filters and distortion.

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.160
 You know, like I kind of had a sound in my head and I was trying to think of a way to

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.040
 multi layer, destroy audio.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:11.080
 Like I used to do with software, but try to replicate that now in the modular like,

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.480
 Oh, my side style.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.480
 Yeah.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.480
 Yeah.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.600
 Like I used to create like weird chains of like, like using multiple instances of like

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:25.760
 homicide in conjunction with like compressors and, you know, EQs and shit, multiple multi

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.800
 band EQs, you know, I mean, to just saturate specific bands, kind of like we were just

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.720
 talking about with your bug brand filter.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.760
 That was like one of my tricks.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.600
 You know what I mean was the just like stack EQs and distort certain frequency ranges,

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.880
 cut out everything else and then layer that up with other shit.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.480
 At the time, it sounded good to me over the years listening back on some of that, I'm

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.720
 like, yeah, the software did not distort nicely.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.720
 You know what I mean?

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:54.240
 It was kind of shitty.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.840
 But the concept is still something that I would like to achieve.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.880
 So I'd like to try to figure out how to do it with hardware.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.840
 So I was just looking into new distortion modules and things that kind of slipped under my radar.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:11.720
 And I saw a picture of one of the animal factory modules and it just caught my eye.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.720
 Like the design of it.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.720
 I was like, that's interesting.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.720
 I've never seen that before.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.000
 I have no idea what that is.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.320
 So I started like reverse engineering at the figure out, you know, who made it eventually

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.720
 I was able to match the artwork with a pedal.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:30.200
 And I was like, okay, so then I found the website for animal factory amplifiers.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:34.640
 I was like, okay, these guys have been making, well, it's a guy, I should say, he's been making

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:40.440
 pedals for a few years now, recently got into making modules back like last year, 2018,

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.120
 I think was his first modular run.

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:49.400
 And he's slowly converting all of his pedals to modules, but he didn't want it to just

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.560
 be a port.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:55.720
 He wanted to bring it to modular, but also make sure that like all the sound was intact

00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:00.520
 and also offer CV over everything that didn't exist in the pedal format.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.640
 And I was like, okay, I can get behind that.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:08.840
 And so I just wanted to get some more like info on who he is, you know, who the company

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:09.840
 was.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:16.360
 And I found a Schneider's Layton workshop demo video on YouTube where he's just like demoing

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:20.640
 a few of his pedals and talking about him in length for like an hour and talking about

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.940
 how his influences are all from like industrial background.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.560
 He listened to coil, throw out in gristle, new bot and all this stuff.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:32.120
 And he was saying like back when they first got internet, he's based in India.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.360
 I don't remember if I said that or not, but yeah, he did not.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:38.040
 Yeah, he's based in India and he was saying like when he was young and like all of his

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.640
 friends had just gotten the internet and were like learning how to download porn and all

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:46.000
 this, he was busy finding ways to download distortion circuits.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.240
 And like schematics, like that was his jam.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.200
 So that's what he's been doing for like the last few years.

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.880
 And now like he's going the modular route and I was like, I could definitely support

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.880
 this dude.

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:04.000
 Like, yeah, you know, he seems to be on the level of a very similar mindset, you know,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.760
 like where I like to take my shit, you know, musically.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:15.040
 And so so far I got two modules of his, the coma delay and the pit viper distortion.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:21.040
 So both of these I just got very recently, haven't had a chance to dive into them too

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.040
 much.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:28.560
 But like the pit viper, it kind of reminds me of like an opto dist on steroids.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.560
 Okay.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.520
 Like to the different lot of different tones.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:37.840
 I think there's like a, I don't know for certain if it's a LED based, I think it is.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.280
 It sounds like it is.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.880
 And there's definitely some things lighting up inside the panel when I look.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.080
 So I'm pretty sure it's like opto based.

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:51.000
 But yeah, there's just so many different ways like that he has in there to get different

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.400
 tones and different like just saturation levels.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.600
 You can almost get lost in it.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.600
 You know what I mean?

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.600
 Like every knob you turn or knob you hit can interact with something else in a different

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.600
 way.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.600
 You know what I mean?

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.960
 So a lot of, a lot of versatility to it, which is what I'm all about when it comes to

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.960
 distortion.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:08.960
 I don't like one trick ponies.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.360
 That's why I don't have an opto dist anymore.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.360
 You know what I mean?

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.960
 It's like, okay, this sounds good, but it's to one flavor.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:15.960
 It is.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.880
 You know what I mean?

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.720
 So the pit viper is one of his oldest designs.

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:28.400
 The stuff that he's built since then has like a lot more range and weird ways that it

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.840
 can just shred audio.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.680
 The one that I just pre-ordered, it's called the God Eater.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.720
 And it's more made for like, basey tones, like for bass guitar, bass synths.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.720
 Yeah.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.120
 And it's got some weird low end to it.

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:44.600
 It's supposed to be able to like mangle the shit out of stuff, but retain low frequency.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.600
 Yeah.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.600
 Exactly.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.960
 And I was like, hell yeah.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.960
 So that is on pre-order now.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.880
 That should ship out mid December, he said.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.800
 So I'm very excited to get that one.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.440
 Is that based on a pedal that already exists?

00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.440
 Yeah.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.440
 Okay.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.240
 But now it'll have all the CV.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.640
 But you've been able to like hear demos of the pedal to get an idea of what it does.

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:11.480
 Yeah, that was one of the things that he demoed in the workshop demo that I watched.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.600
 Going back and forth with him too, he was telling me some of this stuff.

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.800
 I kind of got into some email communications with him.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:21.360
 When I placed the order for the coma delay, he kind of replied back, because how did someone

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:25.040
 find out about a little, you know, pedal shop all the way over here in India?

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:30.480
 And I was like, it's been a strange journey, dude, to how I've ended up finding out, you

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.680
 know, who you are.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.400
 I said, I'd like to order pretty much everything that you have available.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.000
 At this point, so that's on pre-order.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.800
 The other one, he released it last year, like with the pit viper, but he's decided he wants

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.240
 to add more functionality to it and improve it.

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.640
 So he's taken like the original version is now out of stock.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.080
 Well, he kind of makes these tweaks.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.560
 He hasn't given me an ETA on one.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.560
 That'll be complete.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:00.320
 But once it is, I'm likely going to order that as well right off the bat.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.120
 Did he say what those new tweaks are going to be?

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:07.680
 I can't remember off the top of my head, but he said he just wanted to improve it.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.360
 So I'm into that.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.160
 You know, the more, I guess, options he puts into it and different flavors, I'm, you know,

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.480
 the happier I'll be for sure.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:21.200
 But yeah, I haven't found any other distortions like that in Europe so far that have seemed

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.400
 so like geared towards noise and industrial.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:30.480
 You know, a lot of them just seemed like your standard types of distortion or one flavor

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.480
 of it.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.440
 It's really something you can explore.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:38.560
 I like the fact that he seems to be making circuits that are meant to be deep-dived.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.560
 You know?

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.560
 Yeah.

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:41.560
 Yeah.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:48.080
 Do you see there is a new tool, scorn kit that's coming out next year and it's like

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.880
 a dual distortion module.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:54.000
 They have a preview on thonk and it was just put on there in like the past two days or

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.680
 something like that.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.880
 But looked intriguing.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.120
 It's not a good that's posted.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.120
 I did not.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.320
 Yeah, you might want to check it out, but I will.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.320
 Yeah.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:12.040
 Like, like, because I'm still trying to build out like my network, you know what I mean?

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:17.000
 And the animal factor stuff is definitely going to be a key player in that.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.520
 But it's probably not going to stop there either.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.040
 Do you have to, like, get these directly from him?

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.640
 Is there any distro for this stuff?

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.640
 Perfect.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.160
 Circuit carries some of the pedals and a couple of the two modules that are out right

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.680
 now, but they're all out of stock.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.480
 It all says like arriving soon.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.800
 Um, so I think they say that for a lot of stuff.

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.800
 Yeah.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.520
 But yeah, that's the only place stateside that I've found so far that carries their

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.800
 stuff.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.400
 So I just ordered directly from him and it arrived pretty quickly.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.560
 It was like within three days via FedEx.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.160
 I was, yeah, I was real surprised.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.400
 I was like, Holy shit.

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.400
 That got here already.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.720
 I was expecting it to take like weeks, you know, like, like when I ordered something from

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:56.240
 like Erica sense or whatever it takes, usually at least a week, you know, to travel across

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.240
 seas.

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.240
 Yeah.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:04.040
 Bug brands always a week at best because it's UK and customs.

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:07.240
 But you saw the packaging too, like the boxes.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.240
 Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.240
 Yeah.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.880
 They're like solid black, nice logo on the front.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.240
 They're magnetically sealed.

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.800
 Yeah, little like, you know, snapshot when you close it.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.560
 I was like, that is a nice touch, you know.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:23.560
 So like everything about them so far just kind of like screams, you know, my name, it's

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.560
 got my attention.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.280
 Like everything from like his aesthetics to his philosophies to the sound of the motto

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.280
 so far.

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.120
 I'm like, it's a shame he's all the way in India.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.880
 You know, he's the type of dude I feel like I could just like chill in a coffee shop with

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.600
 all day and just shoot the shit and talk about fucking distortion with, you know.

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:39.600
 Right.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.920
 Did the pit viper come with an actual pit viper?

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.400
 Yeah, it slipped out.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.200
 It's roaming around here somewhere.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.200
 Sure.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.200
 Well, deadly ass.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.200
 It's very dangerous.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.200
 It's very dangerous.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.960
 I've been making friends with my cat.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:59.960
 I feel like we would be not doing our jobs as, you know, informers of the public.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:00.960
 Yeah.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:11.240
 As important synthesizer journalists in the, if we did not mention, baringer.

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.760
 Yeah.

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.800
 Like, I think we had on the list here to talk about a couple of the new things.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.960
 It might almost be easier at this point to release what they're not cloning.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:23.960
 Yeah.

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:29.640
 Because the list is getting insane and it's like impossible to keep track of the wasp

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.040
 videos dropped today or yesterday.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.600
 Yeah.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:39.960
 The drops of videos of the wasp, I was still kind of reeling from the TD three and the bro

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.960
 one.

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.960
 Yeah.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:42.960
 Announcements.

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.360
 Like when I saw the wasp, I was like, like, oh, is this, is this a joke?

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.400
 Because it almost seemed like it was self referential.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.800
 Like we're just fucking cloning everything.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.800
 Yeah.

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:51.800
 And it was like, nothing safe.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.800
 You can't save.

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.640
 You're a hydro wife.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.960
 $150 TD three though.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.960
 Yeah.

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.720
 It's kind of ridiculous for a full analog thing.

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.800
 And they even like clone the DS one and put it in there too.

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.000
 Just like poke the barrel a little bit more.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 Yeah.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 Yeah.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.800
 It didn't sound not like a 303.

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.200
 You know what I mean?

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.440
 It was kind of like, okay, that's, that's convincing.

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.440
 It's not identical.

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.440
 Yeah.

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.120
 But for 150 bucks, who fucking cares?

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:25.040
 It's not going to be like a Dinsync RE 303, which is like pretty meticulously done.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:29.760
 But you know, it's going to be that sound basically.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.640
 It's not a one to one clone.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.600
 It's not a blown out version like an Avalon.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.400
 It's your cheapo $150.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.280
 I want to make close enough acid.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.520
 You know what I mean?

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:48.240
 That's, that's what pisses me off about it in a way is like, why not clone the fucking

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.240
 devil fish?

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.240
 Yeah.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:54.560
 You know, if you're going to clone it, you've got ultimate flexibility at the point CV and

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.600
 all the mods and like the filter attack and like all that shit.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.600
 Just do it.

00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.600
 And like 150 bucks.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.600
 Okay.

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.600
 That's amazing and astounding.

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:07.600
 Dude, if you added all of the shit and it was 250, that would still be insane.

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.600
 Yeah.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.040
 Like that would be like a no brainer purchase with all of that shit in it.

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.040
 Yeah.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.480
 The two that I like the least are the bro one and the mo clone just because like maybe

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.280
 Dave Smith was going to put out his own pro one clone.

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.280
 Yeah.

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.360
 The rolling shit like fuck them.

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.400
 They're doing like they're often MC 707 land and making like super tiny versions.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:30.640
 You can make like a normal 808 and the people I know that have that are like, yeah, it's

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.640
 fucking great.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.840
 Like they're cool features on it.

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:33.840
 Like I'm down.

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.840
 That's awesome.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:35.840
 It's affordable.

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.920
 Like they did what Roland should have done in a lot of ways.

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.880
 And the Wasp is another example of that.

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.760
 Like people have been cloning the filter on it for a while now.

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:48.640
 Like that's not been hard to find or even you know, people have been doing that for

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:54.160
 a but they actually have the full functioning as it was wasp clone.

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.080
 You're not taking food out of anyone's mouth at this point.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.080
 Yeah.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.080
 Dopford did it with the filters.

00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.640
 You know, and other people have cloned other wasp shit.

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.640
 There's the Jasper DIY.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:01.640
 Yeah.

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.640
 So that's the one that's like a.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.120
 I've been seeing a lot of those kids popping up.

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.120
 Oh yeah.

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.480
 Everyone's like doing a dump.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.480
 But no, I think like if you're going to do this dig deep.

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.480
 What was the monopole?

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:20.160
 The other one like to me that's very exciting because that has been I use the software, the

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:25.640
 core legacy software one and I've you I usually use the shit out of it.

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:26.640
 Filter rules.

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.480
 But the actual hardware has just been that is not so expensive.

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.720
 It's so expensive and it's it's probably a pain to ask to maintain.

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.280
 But the sound of it's amazing.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.080
 They can pull that one off.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.080
 Fuck.

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.560
 I ain't gonna lie man.

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.920
 I was actually tempted the most by the burrow one.

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:46.000
 And it was like the one that was kind of making me feel the most guilty too.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.920
 Because the same thing I was like man like, you know, what did Dave Smith put out, you

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:53.480
 know, his own, you know, but then I remember like he kind of did.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:58.360
 You know, he hit the pro two exists and things like that and like he's not going to do it.

00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.360
 Right.

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:04.080
 He's not going to do a true like retro, you know, flashback version.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.080
 Yeah, exactly.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.200
 He's doing bigger, better things.

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:12.200
 So like if Beringer is picking up that ball and running with it and so be it.

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:17.880
 And it sounded good, you know, like I really wanted it to not like I was listening to

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:18.880
 the demos.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.360
 I was like, oh yeah, please sound like shit because they're like one on one clone does

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.720
 not sound like a one on one to me.

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.720
 You know what I mean?

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:27.560
 I got had no interest in buying it once I heard that the burrow one I listened to and

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.560
 I was like, oh fuck.

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:31.720
 It was like that kind of nails it, you know what I mean?

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.040
 And it's cheap.

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.600
 And it's you can slap it in your Euro rack.

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.400
 I was like, fuck, this is tempting.

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.560
 Get that shit for like 250 bucks.

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:40.560
 Yeah.

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.800
 So who's it going to be?

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.640
 One of us has to do this.

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:49.040
 One of us is going to get one of these Beringer since who's going to do it.

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.360
 I mean, I don't know.

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.360
 It's going to be you, Craig.

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.360
 It's just late.

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.360
 Let's just accept.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.360
 I don't have the rack space right now.

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.640
 It's something like kind of consolidating there.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.080
 I mean, I could probably put it over there.

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.520
 Um, I don't know, man.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:06.040
 Like I kind of want it, but at the same time, I'm like, do you like the MS 20 shit that they

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.040
 did?

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.680
 Or do you think that doesn't sound right?

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.840
 I have two different opinions on that.

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.360
 I think it sounds close enough, but it's kind of like you were saying, like, why didn't

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:15.360
 they call them the double fish?

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.640
 I feel the same way about the MS 20.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:20.560
 I'm like, why didn't they do the version that is like more blown out with some of the

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.600
 mods, you know what I mean?

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:25.000
 All that like the better version, you know what I mean?

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.560
 Like it's not like they even have to be innovative.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.920
 Like clearly, clearly Beringer is not trying to innovate here.

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.200
 They're not pushing any envelope.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.200
 They're not adding anything new to these things really.

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:42.000
 They're just taking pre-existing things and packaging them for a modern market.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.960
 But like if you're just going to do that, won't you clone the versions that like have

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:49.400
 already been considered like the successors to the originals?

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.400
 You know what I mean?

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.640
 Like I don't know.

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.440
 That's one thing I like about the RD 808 is for the clap circuit.

00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:00.260
 They have the ability to toy and turn the white noise off, which my, my 808 only does

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:01.260
 when you turn it on.

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.200
 And for a few minutes, it fucks up in the circuit.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.560
 It doesn't connect, but it's the greatest clap sound ever.

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:10.280
 And then when you turn the reverb on or the white noise quote unquote reverb, it's like

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.280
 man, okay.

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.520
 Could you knob for it?

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:14.800
 Could you just actually modify yours to starve that?

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.040
 I just want to be kind of sacrilegious.

00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.040
 It would be great.

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:22.280
 Like I would love it if it turned out all the PCBs in the baron just stuff had like patch

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.280
 points.

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.280
 Yeah.

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.560
 Well, we built this so you can hack it then I'd be like, you're fucking, yeah, that would

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:27.560
 be awesome.

00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.320
 Some people were saying that there is space in some of these like someone mentioned that

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:34.760
 the baron there was like some space for some mods and but do they actually have the same

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:40.160
 with the 303 the breakout buses like on some of those, like those PCBs that are like designed

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.160
 to be hacked.

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:45.200
 They'll have like this pain has a breakout and then you can actually just, you know,

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.720
 redo them as you want.

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:47.720
 Right.

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:52.600
 If they went that far ahead where you had a through hole to actually, you know, something

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.600
 to say over.

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.600
 Yeah.

00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.600
 Something that symbols like the MS 20.

00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.600
 Yeah.

00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.600
 Yeah.

00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.600
 Exactly.

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.240
 My hope is that these clones will drive down the prices on some of the originals.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.240
 Right.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:10.240
 And I could get myself an MS 20 M like the real one and, you know, with the mods and everything.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.120
 I'm going to throw something out there though.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.560
 Something that old shit is getting real hard to maintain.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.560
 Yeah.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.400
 I kind of want new new shit.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400
 Yeah.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.400
 Yeah.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.800
 But then then you're putting a lot of trust into baron shoes quality control.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.800
 No, that's a thing.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800
 No real.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.800
 Which is worse.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.800
 Right.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.800
 Barringer quality control or a 40 year old.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.800
 Right.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.880
 Either way, you're probably going to get a year's worth of fun either way.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.600
 I'm going to have to open this up at some point and fix it.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:41.720
 I'm right on the edge of 40 and I'm getting shitty.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.720
 That's true, man.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.960
 Some of the shit's like older than us.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.960
 If not as old.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.960
 Yeah.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:46.960
 It's crazy to think about.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:51.520
 Maybe you guys.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.800
 So we covered all the new shit.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:01:00.120
 Crossover, the bionic cluster, animal factory, voltage lab, general shit.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.880
 We had barringer, soma.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:06.200
 Oh, the superlative.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.400
 If that's how you say it.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.400
 Superlative.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.400
 Superlative.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.400
 Thank you.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.400
 All right.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.400
 So how's that pronounced?

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.400
 Superlative.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.400
 Superlative.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.680
 Why are you doing your head like that?

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.240
 I'm trying to drill it into my brain.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.880
 Superlative.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.400
 What does that mean to?

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.320
 It's like a glowing adjective.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.880
 Yeah, like best.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.880
 Yeah, yeah.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.880
 Instead of better.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.680
 What a bunch of pretentious fucks.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.680
 Yeah.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:35.760
 That's why I was using my lofty academic voice for that.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.760
 Sperlative.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.960
 That's kind of appropriate then because it's kind of where I was going to go with this

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.400
 topic is like you guys know my loves for the one on one.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.400
 Yeah.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:54.360
 Superlative instruments have released a SB01.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.760
 All black modernized SH101 clone.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.760
 Then as fuck.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.600
 Then as fuck.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600
 Sleeque.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.040
 Amazing looking.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.120
 It looks like my dream 101.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:15.720
 But I didn't back the Kickstarter because I have zero fucking faith in these guys.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.720
 Yeah.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:23.920
 There's nothing on their entire campaign that has given me like any confidence in them.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.480
 This is their first project.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.760
 They've done nothing else.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.760
 Yeah.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.920
 Leading up to this.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.920
 So I wanted to do some research into them.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920
 You know what I mean?

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920
 I was like okay.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.760
 There was videos of them at different conventions.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.760
 Sure.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.760
 Or them.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.760
 It might just be that guy.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.760
 Right.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.760
 He's talked.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.760
 He's like you like he exists.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.760
 This is not entirely vaporware.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.960
 Well, that's the thing.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960
 Like or is it?

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.200
 It kind of feels like.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.880
 Like they've met their goal.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.480
 Like they met it within the first week.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.560
 They've you know exceeded it now by far.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:03:01.120
 I think today's the last day as of this recording for their Kickstarter campaign.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.400
 But like he's he was talking at certain conventions and things like that.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:10.560
 And he never really gave any insight into like them as a company or why they're even

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.560
 doing this.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:12.560
 You know what I mean?

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.120
 This is bringing to the table.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.880
 It just kind of felt like a baronger junior to me.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.360
 Like they're just cloning an instrument.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.360
 You know what I mean?

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.400
 Putting it in a sleeker case.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:31.200
 So I did some digging and I found this article that the dude behind it did with like some

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:38.880
 financial people and was like saying basically like he just wants to be a startup guy.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:44.480
 And he figured that vintage synthesizers would be a niche that he could corner.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.480
 Like this dude is just like totally faking it.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.480
 Yeah.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480
 I saw a gap in the market.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480
 Exactly.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.040
 And like reading the article I was like okay that is kind of what I had suspected from

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.040
 the start.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:02.920
 And he's saying he was like struggling to find investors in this vintage synthesizer concept

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.240
 that he was putting out there.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.000
 So he eventually took it to Kickstarter and made some fancy looking videos.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.200
 Like I even showed it to Cyrus.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.800
 You know, and Cyrus is all about like marketing and aesthetic.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.800
 Yeah.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800
 And he got back to me within minutes.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.600
 He was like these guys are really good at making a marketing video.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.600
 I was like right.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.400
 He was like but that's like all it looks like.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.400
 I said right.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.760
 He's like yeah I don't know if I trust that.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.000
 I said that was my vibe.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.520
 I said that's why I sent this to you.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.880
 And I didn't even say anything.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.480
 I didn't put it in that context.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.480
 I just wanted to see his response.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.280
 And he came back at me and was like okay I'm glad to know that I'm not like off base here

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.840
 and thinking that.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.400
 It's like 900 bucks right.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.400
 Yeah.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.400
 Something like that.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.400
 Yeah.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.400
 Which is not cheap.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.400
 Not cheap but a good put.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.960
 You're going to pay a lot more for a real 101.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.960
 Sure.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.240
 Well a good a bit.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.640
 For a working one.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.640
 Yeah.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.640
 Yeah.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:00.040
 And it doesn't really offer anything new over the classic except that it has an on board

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.040
 battery.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.920
 You don't need to plug it in.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.880
 And that's another issue.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.880
 You know what I mean?

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.880
 Like irreplaceable batteries.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:09.880
 Yeah.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.880
 You know what I mean?

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.720
 I thought there was something USB on it too.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.720
 That's the power.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.800
 Oh it's just power.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.400
 It's not like maybe.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.360
 Some people do that now.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.160
 That deluge.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.160
 It might be able to do some stuff through USB.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.280
 I just know that that's its source of power.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.320
 You know it's been a minute since I looked at the campaign.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:33.680
 It was just something that I wanted to bring up because like within a week he had over 400k.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.680
 Holy shit.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.680
 I think it was 400.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.320
 It was even 40 or 400.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.320
 Right.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.320
 Right.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.320
 That's a big number.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.320
 For a company.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.520
 We may have talked about this in the past with like Kickstarter but like to give someone

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.920
 who has you know no history.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.480
 No one's really that familiar with even who the dude is.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.480
 Right.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:56.280
 Like he hasn't like you need to deliver on something to show that you know how to manufacture

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.520
 something on any kind of scale.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:03.400
 He could have literally bought 101 gutted it, made a case.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.880
 Put the hardware in there and said cool I got this prototype and actually it's just

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.640
 knowing that when he gets the 400k's like I'll figure it out.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.560
 I didn't even trust the demo videos.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.040
 Like there wasn't any video that I saw at the time when I looked at it where it wasn't

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.080
 going through an effects pedal.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.760
 Most of the time it was going through a strum and pedal.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.720
 The El Capistan.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.220
 Oh okay.

01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.160
 Which has a very vintage sound anyways.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.680
 So you could be running any shit oscillator through it.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.840
 I mean like listen to that vintage sound.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.000
 You know what I mean.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.080
 That could just be nothing but an iPhone.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.080
 Yeah.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.680
 Under that hood and it's just a recording.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.040
 It just seemed like it almost seemed like fake.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:43.160
 You know all the way through like maybe that concept model is actually functioning maybe

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.480
 it's not who the fuck knows.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:49.080
 There's not enough info or videos or any track record of these guys.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.560
 You know.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.040
 So I found the risks.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.040
 Oh yeah.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.040
 What does he say about the risks?

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:59.280
 Like we've been developing the SBO1 over the last two years through six major prototypes

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.920
 with a commitment to quality and reliability.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.880
 Blah blah blah.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:09.800
 We are confident our synthesizer can be manufactured to the high standards and begin shipping

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.880
 to our backers early next summer.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.680
 Pillow Talk.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:17.520
 It says built the scale.

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.920
 Ready to go.

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.920
 That's it.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.920
 Yeah.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:25.080
 There's something there's nothing in here that gives me the warm and fuzzies like I don't

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.080
 know.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.200
 There's a lot of people are still really burned about the fluxes.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.200
 Yeah.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.160
 I was just going to bring it up because I was one of those people you had one at one point.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.160
 Yeah.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:38.520
 That's what I'll say for whatever with the voltage I like they shipped and it works.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.520
 Yeah.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:43.040
 You know there's like a big difference there and the MIDI in on the fluxes one still doesn't

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.640
 do MIDI in recording.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.400
 It just doesn't like there are huge gaps on it.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:53.560
 I didn't back the Pittsburgh modular thing but if they did put something out there that

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.360
 was appealing to me and I was like interested in it.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.400
 At no point would I ever think oh I wonder if they're going to get it done.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.400
 Right.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.400
 You know if they're going to get it done.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400
 Yeah.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.400
 Yeah.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.400
 It's a superlative thing.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:08.800
 It's like it doesn't like compare their Kickstarter to like Paul's.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.800
 You know what I mean?

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.000
 Paul has a track record.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.240
 He explains everything like that is something even if I didn't even if I wasn't familiar

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:20.200
 with like synthesis technology as like a company looking at his Kickstarter like it

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:25.960
 would give me confidence to back that if it was something that I wanted like even if

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:33.160
 this goes off smoothly like the whole Kickstarter thing and everyone gets their product.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.160
 What about quality control?

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.160
 You know what I mean?

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.640
 Like who knows if this thing will actually be worth eight hundred some dollars or if it's

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.080
 going to be.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.360
 The Beringer level.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:50.800
 Is it like is it a hundred and fifty dollars in the last more than a couple years.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.800
 Maybe it will.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.040
 I don't know manufacturing processes are different now.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.040
 It's cheaper.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.720
 They've got the economies of scale for sure.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.720
 My Midas mixer that they help produce is fucking awesome.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.720
 Mm hmm.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.200
 So something is to be said for that cheap.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.920
 I think they've crossed the line into being suspiciously cheap.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:15.680
 And they're still making profit of one hundred fifty bucks three oh three like with a software

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.360
 editor front end like.

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.240
 Yeah, I mean it's I mean now you're talking about like I don't know if this is a fair

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:27.760
 comparison but like that's the type of like cost and expected quality you associate with

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.760
 like Ikea.

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:29.760
 Exactly.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.080
 I actually don't even trust their tables that much.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.480
 I got like an Ikea table.

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.120
 Actually, I think it's this one.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.120
 Yeah.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:41.080
 You can hear how hollow and shitty these are through the microphone just by tapping on it.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.080
 Yeah.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.640
 I told you like I cut one of these.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.640
 Mm hmm.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.640
 Because it was cardboard inside.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.640
 It's hollow.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.640
 It is hollow.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:52.520
 It's corrugated like corrugated like weird angular cardboard and it's it's sturdy like

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:59.720
 it gives it gives a very strong simulation of wood or wood like substance.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:06.200
 But when I cut it I think I dramatically reduced its um what's it called strength.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.200
 Yeah.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.200
 And I'm load bearing.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.200
 It's load bearing.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.200
 It is definitely going to collapse.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.880
 It's like this Instagram videos where they cut like a chair apart and put like a piece

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.280
 of corn to patch it and they paint over it and sand it.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.520
 It's like six or toilet with ramen.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.320
 Ramen, except.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.240
 Probably enough.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.520
 I heard that's what's inside the SBO 101.

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.520
 Yeah.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:34.520
 The circuits are just fused together with ramen.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.100
 (intense music)

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:40.020
 (crowd cheering)

01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.700
 (intense music)

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.620
 (crowd cheering)

01:10:45.620 --> 01:11:08.460
 (crowd cheering)
