WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.560
 [Music]

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.120
 You have some even type processor.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.800
 Yeah, the Eclipse that I got from a friend of mine, Mariana, years ago for like half price.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.400
 And fucking, that thing's amazing.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.440
 A lot of the stuff we were playing today was running through that at points.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.200
 Oh, nice, nice.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 It's on a crate.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.760
 Yeah, that's a hell of a processor.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.440
 I always wanted either an Eclipse or like the old school H3000s and shit.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.640
 Oh yeah, for like local processing.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.280
 But what do you use it for primarily like run beats through it?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.240
 Yeah, beats since everything.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.080
 It's on an aux send from the desk.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.000
 So a lot of stuff goes through it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.560
 But yeah, things can you go through once?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.360
 You can do a mono, but it's stereo and stereo out.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.880
 Okay.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.320
 It's the H8000 has like two pairs of stereo outs.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.960
 And then this new 9000 has like eight ends and eight outs.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.440
 Nice.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.600
 Yeah, it seems ridiculous.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.560
 What were you running through earlier today?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.080
 A modular, my modular signal, your modular signal.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.600
 Oh, nice.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.080
 That's pretty much it.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.960
 Oh, cool.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.600
 Yeah, it helps to glue, well it can glue sounds together kind of if you have them run through

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.880
 the same processor obviously.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.480
 But do a little of that.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.040
 I feel like that's what I'm lacking in now.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.720
 I don't have any, aside from like a million different distortions.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.680
 I don't have like a processor proper, you know?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.520
 Yeah, because clouds isn't that.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.440
 No, it's like it can be.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.600
 I've used it for that.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.000
 Yeah, but it's not that.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Yeah.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.320
 And I used to have the old boss shit.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.920
 Like I had the SE70 and all that stuff.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 But that's gone now.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.600
 I had a couple things that I sold to because I just wasn't too thrilled with them.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.240
 I had that fireworks.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.240
 Oh, right.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.760
 That thing sucked.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 It was a TC electronic.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.920
 I think it was TC electronic.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920
 Yeah, I think so.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.480
 It was just like a processor, you know what I mean?

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.360
 But it just didn't get me where I needed, you know what I mean?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.200
 Like it had very unlimited processing power.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.920
 Like you could get granular with its little like, you know, digital module things.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.440
 Like you'd get into the OS and set things up.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.960
 And just when I started to get things like where I'd like to be, it would run out of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.360
 juice and I couldn't add more things to it.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.560
 I'm just like, fuck this.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560
 You know, it was real annoying.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.200
 Yeah, the eclipse is cool too because it loads all the pedals, like all their eventide

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200
 pedals.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.200
 You can just load any of the presets like right from there.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200
 Nice.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.320
 A lot of more taken from that and put into like the space pedal, like the echo space of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.640
 God or whatever preset or something like a lot of like the black hole preset.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.960
 No, the black hole wall.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960
 Yeah.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.960
 Okay.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.960
 And they kind of ported it over to that pedal.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.840
 H9 to the things fucking awesome.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.840
 The white one.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840
 The little white guy.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840
 I didn't know yet.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.840
 Oh yeah.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.840
 That's actually what I was just looking at recently.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.840
 I highly recommend it.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.840
 Yeah.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.360
 It sounds just as good as their act is.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.840
 What's all in that aside from reverb?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.840
 Does it have other shit?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.840
 Everything.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.240
 You load all those pedal presets.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.240
 There's the core one.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.000
 There's the mid grade one and then like the maxed out one.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Okay.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 The mid grade one, that's what I got.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.920
 It comes with like four presets and they're like 20 bucks a pop when you get them through

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.160
 the store or whatever.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.960
 But they just, they have a deal right now that I'm probably going to do where I can

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.360
 max out my shit for like half the price.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.040
 So it would be like 150 bucks instead of 300 bucks for me just to have it like everything.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.200
 And then from that point when you max it out, you get everything for free in the future.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.040
 What's the difference between one and one of those little guys or like the big.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.040
 Um, it's, there are more parameter.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.520
 Well, there are probably more parameters.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.720
 It's a little nicer to edit the rack because you can just be like, oh this and then turn

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720
 the knob.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.160
 Whereas that like the pedals, you got a page through it.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.000
 Okay.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.640
 So it has the app, which is pretty sweet.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.160
 Um, and I think it's Android or iOS and then you can just edit like you can see everything

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.160
 from here.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.720
 It hooks up with a Bluetooth, change all the shit right here.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.520
 It's just really nice.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.280
 It's like, it's real easy to use like, and this is like the morphing between preset, but

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.600
 you kind of like the Nord modular does with the morphing and the presets.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.000
 It's actually easier on the device itself.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.800
 It's like the hot knob.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.120
 It has like one knob or something.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.520
 Yeah, it has a one knob.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.240
 And on the iPad, it's like a lot of looks just like their space of the time factor pedals.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.640
 It's like the same format kind of.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.840
 Yeah, because I've been seen there was a lot in like modular videos lately.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.240
 A lot of people run and shit through them.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.680
 And I didn't even know what it was.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.560
 I mean, it had one knob and I was like, oh, I'll give a fuck about whatever that is.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.240
 But then I started to hear like, you know, I watched like a couple, not like demos of

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.360
 the unit, but just demos of other shit running through it.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.760
 And I'm like, well, that sounds good.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.280
 No, it's like, what is this thing?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.840
 And the expression inputs zero to five volt.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.840
 Okay.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.400
 So I'm going to modulate it with a modular.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.400
 Nice.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.040
 And how many like modulation inputs does that like just one?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.040
 Okay.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.040
 Yeah.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.040
 That's better than none.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040
 Yeah.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.040
 I mean, I don't know.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.040
 But you have to make sure it's like rectified.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.240
 You don't want to go bipolar with it.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.560
 So there's a audio dam.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.560
 It's slow.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.640
 That's some video of like, here's this really simple circuit you can make or something.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.640
 It's actually just a cable with a, I forget, it's some like kind of hack to make it only

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.960
 positive voltage, whatever signal you shoot into it.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.880
 Or you can just deal with it in the modular interest.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.880
 Yeah.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.000
 Another thing for me to spend fucking money on.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.360
 The cool thing is that like when you max it out or whatever, if you buy the maxed out

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.200
 one, if you buy the cheap one, if you get another one, it has like all your presets.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.400
 So it's like you can buy the cheap ones in and they have everything still.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.880
 So it's kind of like, it's not just a shady scheme.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.880
 Like if you want multiples of them, which I could see having it other for sure.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.320
 I use it directly on the blow felt right now because the blow felt effects suck.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320
 Yeah.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.240
 So it makes the machine glitch out when you use them.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.200
 So is it a, is it road worthy?

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200
 Is it something you can take out?

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200
 Oh yeah.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200
 You could throw it down the steps and it would be fine.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200
 That's fine.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.200
 That's how I test all the gear.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.440
 Throw it down the fucking steps.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.840
 Oh yeah, it broke.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.320
 Nah, I got a cold sweet water.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.000
 Sweet water has just blocked your number.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.560
 Dude, stop throwing shit down the steps.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.840
 I got the analog for the electron and then returned to the next day and the dude was

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.480
 all pissed off because like the packaging was fucked up and I didn't really fuck up the

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.480
 packaging.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.480
 It was however it came to me.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.600
 I didn't like do anything shitty to it.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.600
 He was just jagged off that like they, you know, if you do it in 30 days, you get the

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.080
 full price back.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.960
 You just paid shipping and I was like, I don't like the sound of this fucking thing.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.040
 First he was trying to give me a hard time, but you know, he caved.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.840
 Wait, after I threatened the life of his children.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.760
 What was, like what was his argument?

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.760
 You don't like it.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760
 Oh yeah.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.520
 He was just pissed off that he lost a sale.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.520
 Gotcha.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.520
 Gotcha.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.480
 So he was like, I'm like, I'm like, you know what sounds better than...

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480
 Is there something else you want?

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.480
 Like no, dude.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.480
 You don't know me.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.920
 Like no, yeah, I'll take that fucking, you know, JDXI or whatever, the rolling thing.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:01.080
 And I don't want your rolling guy, I swear.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.580
 No disrespect to that, Sam.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.600
 But now imagining the electron has like a Glen Gary Glen Ross type of thing.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.960
 Alec Baldwin is just yelling at that guy.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.360
 Coffee's for the closers.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.240
 They beat that dude sound play that day.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.680
 So what other topics do we want to talk about?

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.880
 Because that's beating sales representatives.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.360
 It's the sales of the represent.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.720
 Do we just want to, before we dive into like individual shit, do like anything that we

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.120
 considered our favorites from 2016, like personal shit?

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.560
 I think right off the bat, I would say my favorite of 2016 was the Stilson hammer.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.560
 Yeah.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.640
 Oh, I thought you were going to say the fuzz factory.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.640
 Nope.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.640
 Okay.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.440
 So it was alright to make your case for the Stilson hammer.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440
 I don't know.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.200
 It was exactly kind of what I was looking for.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.360
 You know what I mean?

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.360
 Before I even knew what Stilson was capable of, it's kind of what I was looking for out

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.200
 of a Euro rack sequencer.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.960
 I like how easy it is to dial shit in on it.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.960
 All the sliders.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.360
 I like the fact that you have multiple tracks that you can clock divide down to 32.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.440
 I like the fact that you can just randomize not only the whole sequence, but elements of

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.440
 it.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440
 It was the sequencer I wanted.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.440
 Yeah.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.920
 Now, it's a play devil's advocate.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.000
 You don't have it now.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Not currently.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 What was it?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.880
 You need to get rid of it.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.880
 Rack space?

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.520
 I didn't have enough for it, but now that I have the Mantis case and I was able to move

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:24.880
 some bigger shit to that, I have the rack real estate again for a big sequence or module.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.120
 So it wasn't some deficiency?

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.440
 Like, you know, not at all.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.440
 I liked it.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.920
 I just, at the time, I was doing more percussive shit and I had the very gate and I was like,

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.200
 I don't need this right this second.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.600
 So I just got rid of it until I was going to expand my rack.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.200
 I wasn't sure how I was going to expand it, but I was just planning on doing it.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.840
 Then, like, a month after I sold it, the Mantis case came out and I was like, okay, problem

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.840
 solved.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.440
 Now that I have the space, yeah, I'm going to get it back as soon as possible because

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.440
 I need my sequencing.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.440
 Yes.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.440
 I have it.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.440
 Yeah.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.440
 And I don't know.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.480
 I fucked with a lot of different sequencers over the years and I don't think none of them

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.200
 were so instantly gratifying as Distelson was, you know what I mean?

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.200
 It's just like, at least for the shit that I do, you know what I mean?

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.720
 I'm not doing Tangerine Dream.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.720
 You know what I mean?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:26.160
 I'm using my sequencer to spit out weird random rhythmically sequences or as just strange

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.920
 modulations, sources for other modules, you know what I mean?

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.920
 Yeah.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.920
 And I feel like it's perfect for it.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.840
 What would that put you up as far as a number of sequencers you have?

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.080
 You've got the Verigate, you've got the Metropolis.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.080
 Metropolis.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.680
 Yeah, so that'll be, that'll be sequencer three.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.200
 I like the Verigate but it just doesn't cut it for CV sequencing in my opinion.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.080
 It's powerhouse of a gate sequencer and that's what I use it for.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.080
 Yeah.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:57.440
 I think the two CV tracks on it are a nice bonus but not something that I use very much

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.480
 or fulfills all my sequencing needs, I would say.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.480
 Right, yeah.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:09.360
 Metropolis, like I was talking earlier, it does one style of sequencing very well and

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.880
 not much else, you know what I mean?

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.880
 Yeah.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.200
 So I think the Stilson will fill in all the gaps that I have currently in my system.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.560
 Yeah, the Fuss factory, nice runner up but I wouldn't consider it one of my tops of the

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.560
 year.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.960
 I mean it already existed as a pedal and I have a lot of other distortions.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.760
 This is a great distortion module but it wasn't all that mind blowing or innovative.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.240
 You know what I mean?

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.320
 I'm trying to play on the name but it's a little guy with a little...

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.320
 A promo blob.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.320
 Yes, yeah.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.320
 A promo blob?

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.320
 Yeah.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.320
 It's a delay.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.280
 It doesn't blow me away.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.280
 It's cool.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.000
 I can't remember if that actually came out this year.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.600
 That might have been late 2015.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.040
 I don't think anyone's going to hold our feet to the fire there with that.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.040
 It will.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.040
 Okay.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.040
 We're going to get flamed.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.040
 Yeah.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.840
 If we are then, if we're going to be a little naughty with that.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.840
 Yeah.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:10.200
 If we're going to bend space time continuum here, I'll say that my second runner up then

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.880
 would be the circuit bent VCO.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880
 Oh yeah.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.000
 E390 by Synthesis Technology.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.760
 Yeah, I think that thing's fucking great.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.680
 It released in December, late December 2015.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.640
 I didn't get mine until 2016 so we'll say it counts.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.640
 That was enough.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.640
 Yeah.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.920
 Yeah, I can just get fucking ridiculously absurd sounds out of that thing.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.640
 I mean, it's a vocal synthesis.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640
 You can't just group it.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.640
 Yeah.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.800
 I mean, it's a speech synthesis thing but you know, I don't know.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.480
 You can get a lot more out of it than just that.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.120
 You know what I mean?

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.320
 You start hitting that thing with all kinds of CV.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.880
 Looking forward to getting the expansion.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.880
 Yeah.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.360
 I've tried to get it twice so far and each time it sold out.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.360
 Oh wow.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360
 Like control mod.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.360
 Yeah.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.360
 And I don't really, like we were just discussing earlier.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.440
 I don't like doing the whole pre-order thing so I've just been waiting for it to get back

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.200
 and stock proper and I'll get it then.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.440
 Have you thought about offering to do demos of that but in the way that you would do it?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.120
 Because when he does it, there are great demos but they're very like, oh it's speaking

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120
 spell.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.760
 It has that vibe to it.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.200
 You can just sit there and when he's done, just go, all right well and here's the other

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.320
 shit you can do with it.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.320
 Yeah.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.320
 And then go nuts and make it sound like hell.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.320
 I mean it does rise.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.320
 It does rise.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.320
 Right.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.320
 Why are you doing this?

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.200
 It's not how you do it.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.960
 Supposed to say emergency.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.960
 Yeah.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.000
 Yeah the expanding I think is going to be dope though from what I can tell.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.880
 I mean I was kind of already using the times for it in clouds and shit to make it do that

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:43.320
 style of like looping, stuttering shit anyways but it would be nice to have the screen telling

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.720
 you, you know, all that information.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.720
 Yeah.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.720
 What you're working with and all that jazz.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.640
 It's a nice expansion.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.000
 It looks like you put a lot of thought behind it.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.160
 But yeah, that's my 2016 favorites.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.160
 All right.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.160
 Am I up?

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.160
 Well, all right.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.280
 Well, we can quickly go through mine because I got almost nothing in 2016.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:08.120
 So unless you want to, unless you want me to go at length about how great that two HP

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.440
 envelope generator is.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440
 Hey.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.920
 It's actually really nice but I can only say so many words about an envelope generator.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.640
 That was your knob con purchase, right?

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.640
 It was, yeah.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.720
 It's, I mean all kidding aside, I really do use the shit off it and it's amazing for

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.600
 the two HP but it is not very sexy at all.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.760
 So that's how the LFO kind of is.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:34.520
 Like it does, it's got a reset input, CV input and output for the LFO and actually gate out

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520
 too.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.520
 No.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520
 For that's what I want an LFO to be.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.920
 It's got basic waveforms.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.400
 And it's a, it's taken up a polite amount of space.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.400
 Yeah.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.980
 I don't need a shitload of space for something that's, you know, doing a bread and butter

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.980
 utility thing.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.980
 Right.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.980
 Yeah.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:49.980
 Same thing with that LFO.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.240
 Like you don't, you're not going to fuck with it too much.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.240
 You know.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.240
 Maybe a little.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.640
 But yeah, that's a, it's a very anticlimactic 2016 purchase.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.680
 There might have been something late 2015 I got.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.160
 I can't remember that far back.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160
 Yeah.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.400
 It is harder to remember that.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.400
 Yeah.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:11.080
 For me, like I think at the beginning of, of last year of 2016 I was about to throw like

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.440
 my whole modular out the fucking window because I just wasn't using it much.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.920
 Now I use it all the time and I'm pretty psyched about that.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.200
 Walk two, I think it's a tie for me would be a varigate in Polaris Polaris.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.440
 Fuck, that's great filter like I don't know.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.200
 That's one of the most versatile filters I've ever used to make it get all over the place.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.600
 You're going to sell Greg on that because I think he hates it.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.600
 Yeah.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.760
 All three that I'm looking at right now.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.640
 And varigate actually, it took me a minute.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.280
 I wasn't, I wasn't super sold in the varigate at first.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.120
 And now like I don't really think about it which is kind of my gauge for a sequencer.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.880
 I just wanted to kind of get out of the way and I'm getting much more familiar with it

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.880
 now.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.000
 But you know I have some, I'd like it a little more maybe if it was six gate channels and

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.400
 four CV like that would probably do the trick for me not that I don't use all of them.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.360
 And you know, editing notes on it isn't the most fun because it's hard to see where the

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.120
 note was set at and it's just a little fiddly and you're trying to look on that bar graph

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.360
 that might be obscured by a bunch of cables or something.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.920
 You know, but on the whole it does, it does the trick.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.440
 It didn't, it all for me when I was out calibration.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.080
 When he told me the secret calibration trick, then everything fell together.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.440
 It reminds me of the machine drum a little just in, I use the CV outs for just parameter

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.480
 sequencing a lot, you know.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.440
 So the voltage block is interesting in that way, but I don't think, I don't think I'll

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.600
 go for the voltage block.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.520
 I don't really have the space for it.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.760
 How much HP is the voltage block?

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.360
 I think it's like 20 maybe or something.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.360
 It's not small.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.360
 It's E.A.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.360
 I look back.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.000
 Yeah, might be the same as that actually, which that's probably like 24 something.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.640
 And I definitely think it's like comparable and so maybe a little bit smaller.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:01.160
 I don't know if I need that much CV sequencing, I can get a lot of that just using the MIDI

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:07.960
 box and MIDI to CV converter and just like CC's to get like, you know, sequences of

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.120
 like parameter modulation and shit, but yeah, fair gate and Polaris would probably be

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.120
 it for me.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.480
 I don't even know if Polaris come out this year or was it last year?

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.480
 I think it was last year.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.880
 Yeah, it's pretty new.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.680
 Yeah, I mean, Intel did that whole block and new shit, but they all came out at different

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.680
 times.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.320
 They were all announced like at the same time.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.560
 So I came out and Polaris was the first thing that dropped.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.360
 Like the micro MIDI that was part of it.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.560
 Yeah, the little U MIDI compression module.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.320
 Oh yeah, jelly squatcher, jelly squatcher.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.320
 That's it.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.000
 And the one box stereo thing.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.080
 Yeah, they dropped like all that pretty much around the same time, but then like the releases

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.160
 were kind of staggered.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.920
 So yeah, because Rainmaker was not out until that was late.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.360
 And that was announced at the same time too.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.360
 I think all that was the weird thing with the Polaris was that it didn't really get

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.440
 much fanfare.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:17:00.840
 Like, yeah, when all that stuff got released, like the Polaris wasn't even like it wasn't

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.840
 included.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.840
 You know what I mean?

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.000
 And like the announcements, I just like refreshed their page one time and saw that it was there.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.640
 I was like, what the fuck is this?

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.960
 I was like, this looks like a nice filter.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.960
 And it's cool.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.480
 You know, I guess compared to like the announcement of the Rainmaker and all that jazz kind of

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.280
 fell to the wayside a bit.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.600
 But yeah, I agree.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.360
 It's a hell of a filter.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.800
 That's another comment on my top two.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.560
 You can't have those two modules in the same case together.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.560
 What's that?

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.400
 Because it's kind of you're going to hear every bit of that varigate LED noise through

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400
 that Polaris.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400
 Oh yeah.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.400
 Like it doesn't.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.920
 It affects yours right now.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.640
 But for me, like it was, it fucking drove me crazy.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.520
 Mine not so much right now, but I have noticed with other shit and especially since I put

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.000
 the trash master in there, I will hear the noise through the trash master.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.640
 I guess it's just a common problem with filters in general when it makes certain digital

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.080
 things like, I've noticed a lot of bleeding and things like that.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.920
 Like all the bubble sound stuff you can hear that varigate in there.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.160
 The thing will shit out a lot of radio frequency.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.240
 One of them was worse than others of my three.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.240
 Yeah.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.000
 I can't remember which one one of them was bleeding a little more.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 It's kind of weird.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.480
 I know people complain.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.720
 You pointed me to those threads.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.920
 People complain about noise in the Polaris modules too.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.920
 Just the digital.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.920
 Yeah.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.920
 Yeah.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920
 So we got the distortion.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.920
 Yeah.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.920
 But yeah, also the similar.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.640
 Of course, I don't think I need to like talk about that module much anymore and it's

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.640
 awesomeness.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.640
 Yeah.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.640
 Yeah.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.440
 I talked about how we all dig it in a previous episode.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.440
 But oh shit.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440
 That reminds me.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.440
 I got the little carrot.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.440
 Oh yeah.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.440
 Yeah.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440
 I did something else I bought in 2016.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440
 Yeah.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440
 I don't know if it actually.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440
 Yeah.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.440
 That's new.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.440
 I think I'm almost sure.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.440
 I'm almost sure.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.440
 Close enough.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.440
 I'm counting that.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.440
 We're recounting it.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.440
 Yeah.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.440
 I'm counting that.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.440
 Counted.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.440
 Yeah.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440
 All right.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.440
 Bitbox too.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.440
 Bitbox.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440
 I was a heavy runner up there.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440
 Talk about that.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.440
 Yeah.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.400
 That was exactly what it says for the most part.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.560
 I can't get the MIDI part to work.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.680
 I don't know if it's the cable that I got off eBay that's supposed to work like, you

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:15.040
 know, it uses the TRS Mini Jack like MIDI stuff as one of the clock options.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.320
 I always do the analog clock from my MIDI to CV converter because it seems like it's

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.720
 more consistent that way.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.200
 And if you want to use it to loop, that works a little better that way.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.960
 So the MIDI clock that didn't work out so well for me, maybe something's wrong there.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.600
 But some UI things that could be ironed out for sure.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.880
 I know it's the first release of the firmware basically.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.400
 There are no updates yet, but there's a good list of stuff that seems reasonable.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.520
 Like, you can't use folders to dig into the samples.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.000
 Everything's got to be on the root folder right now.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Okay.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.360
 Which is so you got to scroll through hundreds, literally the samples if you want a lot of

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.480
 stuff on that bank.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.920
 It seems like hopefully you can get folders working on that.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.480
 Some other little things like when you go to switch the output, you can only switch like

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:08.000
 for a whole column of tracks to send it to the FX1 or FX2 output.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.960
 So you've got to go to the track setup and then assign that there.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.960
 It would be nice if you could just do it like any sample cell could go to any output.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.960
 I'm not sure why it's limited to the columns like that.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.840
 It seems like he's like, oh yeah, we could eventually change that.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.280
 He's very responsive on the muff forum about requests that people have.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.920
 Other little stuff would be cool if you could actually see what output that column was going

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.280
 to on the main screen if it was like a one or two, but it's not.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.200
 You have to go like three or four button presses back to be like, oh yeah, that's assigned

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.760
 to FX2 or something.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.760
 So if you want to re-patch it something to work with a preset that you made, you kind

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.800
 of got to do some digging to go back.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.520
 And there's enough screen real estate for you to actually put that number on there.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.720
 They're like empty button slots.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.080
 It's not the things like you can only change some menu items with the knob instead of just

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.240
 hitting like the section of the pad itself.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.240
 Like it's touch screen for people that don't know.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.200
 But it's a touch screen module and it's really sensitive too.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.320
 You can play beats on the touch screen like not that you don't want to do that all the

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.040
 time, but it works really well in that regard.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.880
 The looping I've had partial success with.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.280
 I mean, it doesn't work as well as Ableton works for me as far as looping, which is like

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.760
 sample accurate and pretty damn perfect.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.800
 You can tell when you record something and then play it back against that channel.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.280
 It like flanges a little bit constantly and not within the loop either.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.720
 It's like drifting over time.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720
 It's gorgeous.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.520
 It'll do the trick, but I don't know if it would be like a little portable Ableton like

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.800
 I thought it would be like for a live set.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.560
 It might be able to get it to work that way.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.920
 I think especially, and I even took like a perfectly cut loop from my test like from Ableton.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.560
 Like all right, 128 BPM loop or whatever, cut it perfectly, put it in there.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:53.280
 Now set up a sequence that's 128 being driven from my sync gen, which is like perfect like

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.160
 midi clock basically, try to line it up against that.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.160
 That's when I heard the phasing.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.600
 I'm like, all right, there's something a little off here.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.600
 And even when you reset it, it kind of resets a little slowly.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.720
 Like when you hit it with a reset, well, actually it doesn't have a reset input.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:14.000
 It yeah, it when it stops receiving clock, it knows after like a little bit.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 It's like, oh, this is done.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.880
 And the next time I get a clock, I'm going to reset everything, which does work like

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.880
 well enough.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880
 Okay.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.000
 But one thing about it, it's always running the clock on it in the upper left.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.880
 There's a little like bar and beat count or it's just measures that have it gone by.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.880
 Yeah.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.160
 I don't know why you didn't have a reset input on it.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.320
 That's a really cool thing that the orthogonal 301, their sampler does is any of the gate

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.080
 inputs can be used as a reset, which would be like a really nice feature to have.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.200
 Like why don't you have anything reset that?

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.200
 Sure.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.520
 So hopefully the hardware is like robust enough that he's not limited by a bunch of stuff.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.520
 Like, oh, no, you can't possibly do that.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.160
 Because he even someone, he didn't seem to balk at like using the inputs as outputs too.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.080
 But even if a, you know, the stereo output, it would be cool if you could use those as

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.080
 two monos as well.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.320
 You can't do that right now.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.680
 So you have four outputs instead of two, which I could get down with because I'm not

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.040
 putting much stereo stuff in there.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.600
 I've sampled some cloud stuff in there, but you know, that point if you're looping stereo,

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.520
 it can get, you got twice the chance of it being out of phase or clicks or something

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.480
 like that when you're looping it around.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.840
 But sounds awesome.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.660
 The quality of it's great.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.120
 You don't get much CV input.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.280
 You get start and length, which works, which is great.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.720
 You know, you get pitch to what you get, like plus or minus 12, semi tones.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.240
 So like an octave up and an octave down.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.080
 And then you get the ability to trigger an entire column of stuff at one time with the

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.720
 CV input.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.040
 So that's kind of a cool feature.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.760
 Other choices for the pitch algorithm or like, there's just one.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.760
 There's just one.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.760
 Do you know what it is?

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.920
 No, that's a good question.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.560
 But no, it'd be, it does no time stretching or anything like that.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.200
 Just simple pitch.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.760
 It sounds good enough.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.760
 It's working out really well for me, especially once I move my own sample set into it, but

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:06.240
 then it makes you want like, oh, I want, you know, I'm almost glad it only has three

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.680
 kind of outputs because it makes you want a full chain of stuff to process through all

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.680
 that.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.600
 So generally I have one going into clouds, maybe, you know, dual input on clouds or just one

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.640
 that's like maybe through a filter and then back out to a mixing desk so I can put effects

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.400
 on it, something like that.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.320
 And that's why 10 10.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.680
 Yeah, 10 10 music.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.040
 I think it's their, I think it's their only module.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.040
 Right on.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.480
 But I hope he keeps it going.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.160
 I don't think he'll go too crazy like the orthogonal devices sampler.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.240
 It seems like that dude is going to go nuts for years on that thing.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.600
 And you can even replace the CPU on that.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.120
 It's like a totally modular setup.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.040
 So when that new CPU version comes out, you just plug it into the back of the module and

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:50.160
 you get more horsepower and more sampling space and stuff, which is like pretty brilliant

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.160
 setup.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:57.040
 So I still have some strong lust for that 301, but it is, it's like $880 to get it from Japan.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.000
 Yeah, as a door kind of seems like apples and oranges, different stuff in the spectrum

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.160
 there.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:09.160
 But it makes me like the thing has, you know, CV controlled effects that you can put in chains,

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.880
 like kind of unlimited until you run out of horsepower, it seems.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.480
 So it's tempting, but I don't know.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.160
 Can you get them right now?

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.160
 Yeah.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:24.320
 That thing seemed more like the modular version of an octa track, whereas like the bitbox is

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.680
 like the modular version of like an NPC.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.680
 Exactly.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.680
 That's a good way to put it.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.760
 So the looping, I don't know, I need to play with that a little more.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.200
 But right now just is like, you know, you have 16 samples in your modular that you can

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200
 trigger.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.200
 That sound awesome.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.280
 And it's like 496, like it's not hard to be mad at that.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.280
 Yeah.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.080
 And the modulation with the start and length is cool.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.280
 You can get that kind of, you know, I would always use Ableton granulator for that kind

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.280
 of like stuttery draw.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.280
 Yeah.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.600
 I'm a big fan of that, but yeah, yeah, I would do shit like that, you know, in conjunction

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.720
 with like time stretching, because then you can get a little more gnarly and shit with

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.720
 it.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.160
 But it seems to be kind of like what I'm using the Taurus for now.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160
 You know what I mean?

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.920
 But I really need, needed a looper for live shit too.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.920
 So yeah.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.480
 It's a hell of a pair with the varigate.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.480
 They kind of, you know, work very well together.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.760
 You can trigger all those samples with it.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.320
 And it's just been using the hell out of those too.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.440
 I kind of wish it was a little deeper at points, but as far as like selling the Octatrack and

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.440
 getting that.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.440
 No regrets at all.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.400
 I was not using it for his music.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.400
 Yeah.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.400
 Yeah.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.800
 No, I use this like, I use this shit in music all the time now.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.360
 And before that, I was not like, I was kind of struggling to integrate my modular, especially

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.840
 since I got rid of Renee.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.600
 I always forget that you got rid of that.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.600
 Yeah.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.600
 A while ago.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.600
 So I thought that was your jam.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.280
 At one point, I was going to get it back and then tried the varigate instead.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.000
 And pretty happy with that so far.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.480
 I could see you having both for sure, but not anytime soon.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.120
 So you think you're going to keep the varigate?

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.120
 Yeah.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.120
 Absolutely.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120
 Yeah.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.680
 I mean, I love the shit out of the varigate for.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.680
 Yeah.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.880
 I just wanted it to be 16 steps instead of eight.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.280
 That was my only complaint with it.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.280
 No.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.280
 But this thing, yeah, it's beast.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.240
 I use a lot of the channels in your ways, even though I don't have as many drum modules

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.880
 currently, which I guess that could help me segue into the drum boot.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.880
 Yeah.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.400
 Like I was, it's been such a fucking hit or miss in my opinion with drum modules.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.320
 Like some of them are not deep enough.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.000
 Some of them are just trying to be everything in one.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 You know what I mean?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.240
 It's hard to find a good middle ground, which I guess why I like the solen loose so much

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.840
 you know what I mean?

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.520
 The ultra version, I feel like it's solid as fuck.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.520
 You know what I mean?

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.520
 Yeah.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.520
 Does what it does very well.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.520
 And it sounds unique.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.520
 You know what I mean?

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.840
 There's so many drum modules out there that are just trying to do the whole, I don't

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.560
 know, like the way you think.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.560
 Right.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.520
 There's enough of a market out there for people who are looking for exactly that sound.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.520
 Yeah.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.520
 I mean, they can plug it in.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.760
 It's not super expensive, but they're also not going to get lost in a million features

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.240
 and they're getting that sound that they want.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.360
 At this point, we don't need another one of those.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.360
 That's modular.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.360
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.360
 You know what I mean?

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.360
 That's well covered.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.520
 I guess some people do, but they're just not what I wanted out of my modular.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.520
 You know what I mean?

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.880
 I want to say I'm able to craft something different.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:18.480
 So yeah, at the moment, I don't have too many drum modules again, but I did get the drum

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.840
 brute for the price of a drum module.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840
 Yeah.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.840
 And I'm trying to integrate it, like I was explaining, into the modular.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:34.400
 You know, I mean, utilize all the individual voice outs and run them through the modular

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.400
 for processing.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.560
 Yeah, you were saying you got those two modules for bringing it up to a module level?

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:46.000
 Yeah, I can't remember what it's called, but it's from LADIC.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 They're on the way.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.240
 They haven't arrived yet, unfortunately.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:56.280
 But yeah, they're just little pre-ent modules to take something from line to modular level.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:02.440
 And so with the pair, I'll have eight pre-amps, basically, for pretty much each voice on there.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.280
 Well, usually the voices that you would want to use.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.280
 Right.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.840
 Because some of them are a little flaky, as you heard the hats.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.840
 Yeah, the hats.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.840
 That was disappointing.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.640
 And some of them are kind of nice, like the kick and the clap.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.640
 Yeah.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.640
 I don't know, I like those.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.640
 And it got the zap.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.640
 Zaps good.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.640
 Zaps amazing.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.040
 Zaps good.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.880
 People were hating on the zap, but I think it's fantastic.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.880
 It's a nice app.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.880
 It can be better.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.080
 There's room for improvement on the zap.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.760
 Does that have individual track lengths?

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.760
 Yes.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.760
 That's awesome.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.760
 Yes.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.800
 You have to do mild menu diving to enable that.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.000
 It's called polyrhythm mode, basically.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.240
 You can't just do it by default.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.920
 I guess they didn't want people getting confused.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.600
 So you have to do a shift and then hit the polyrhythm button, which I think is sequence

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.600
 step 16.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.000
 We'll enable it.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.320
 And then you can have individual track lengths.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.320
 So it's always quantized.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.040
 Like you can't report on quantized?

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.040
 There's a mode that unquantized record.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.760
 Oh, so you can even do it completely off the grid?

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.760
 Yeah.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.960
 I don't know how far off the grid it will go, but yeah, you can do it on quantized.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.960
 Oh, that's cool.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.200
 I think that just might be when you're tapping shit in or something.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.920
 Like I haven't fucked with it on quantized too much.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:15.840
 But yeah, there is a way to get into unquantized mode and there is a way to do what they call

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.640
 in between the steps.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640
 You know what I mean?

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.640
 That's awesome.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.640
 It's really attractive.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.320
 It's like per step swing, basically.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.320
 That's awesome.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.520
 You can do individual track swing too, which is cool.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.080
 But yeah, I forget.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.840
 It's a hold key combo, basically.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.200
 And then you use the swing knob while you're holding down like that step and you'll kind

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.200
 of get it off the grid.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.200
 It's awesome.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.200
 Yeah, it's kind of cool.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.200
 That's really appealing.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.120
 Yeah, I mean, for the fucking price, dude, I was like, this thing's worth it, you know,

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.680
 especially the price I paid for it.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.480
 It's a good price if it didn't make fucking audio.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.480
 It's still hell of a super long.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.480
 It's like a beat step.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.120
 Is that not comparable to the beat step price?

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.800
 Yeah, it's like 200 or something.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.400
 It's essentially the beat step under the hood there.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.400
 Yeah, I'm sure it is.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.160
 Probably exactly.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.160
 It's cool.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:07.000
 I'm digging it just not the sounds of certain voices, you know, but then again, that's what

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.400
 processing is for.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.400
 Yeah.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.400
 So it looks cool.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.000
 They did a pretty good job with the design of it.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Yeah.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.480
 I'm using it as a big outboard drum, basically, with a nice...

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.720
 It would have been nice to have like individual inputs, you know what I mean?

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:28.040
 It's a trigger that tracks too, but does it look like you could maybe expand it later

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.320
 with that option or is it like, is it doubtful?

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.560
 The back's pretty filled.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.560
 Okay.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.960
 With all the individual outs and then the different clocks, you can do some nifty shit

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:36.960
 with it too though.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.000
 Like the metronome has an individual output also.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.920
 Like everything has an individual out.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.080
 You can adjust the metronome to be a certain time signature.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.240
 Like the default is one four.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.320
 I've been leaving it at that because that is essentially now a divided clock for me.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.320
 Yeah.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.320
 Right.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.320
 So I'm just going to do a little bit of a shit in a modular.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.120
 Is it a square wave or is it like a pulse?

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.120
 I'm not sure.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.320
 I haven't actually listened to it.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.440
 I've just been using it as a clock.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.240
 You can have the analog clock coming out of it and then you've got your metronome, which

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.440
 is essentially you can have that as a divided clock to whatever.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.440
 Yeah.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.440
 You can do like one eight.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.440
 Yeah.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.720
 I don't know how many more drum models I'll be buying in the near future.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.440
 You know, if I can get this thing to fulfill my needs, doing that and the rhythm and everything

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.440
 else going on.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.120
 I think that was a solid release by them.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.120
 Because I think that's like DR110 circuits in there.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.120
 So I think I saw the Dinsink guy was like kind of throwing that some shade because he

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.400
 was like, enjoy my circuits kind of thing.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.400
 Really?

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.400
 Exactly what I built.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.200
 But he didn't make that either.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.200
 So I don't know.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.200
 In the drum brew?

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.200
 Yeah.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.200
 Really.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.200
 I think so.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200
 Okay.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.200
 See, I had no idea what it was based off of.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.200
 I wasn't sure.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.280
 Do you imagine a noise engineering drum machine?

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.320
 I mean, I'm kind of trying to build one.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.320
 Yeah.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.040
 Like I'm trying to get there.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.200
 I hope the hell he releases more drum stuff.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.920
 That fucking Pico drum.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.920
 Oh yeah.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.280
 And the Pico DSP.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.280
 Yeah.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.280
 Those are awesome.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.280
 Yeah.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.280
 Yeah, they do.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.040
 If I'm going to get more drum modules, probably going to be one or two of those in the foreseeable

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.040
 future.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.800
 There's like 64 samples on that drum.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.800
 Yeah.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.560
 And you can load it with whatever the hell you want.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.560
 It can play two at once.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.560
 Oh yeah.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.560
 And you get one.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.560
 So it's essentially two and one.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.440
 Like over two of them or something like that.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.440
 Something like that.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.440
 Yeah.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.440
 But you got two trigger ends, two outputs.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.640
 The big DSP that they released, I was like, yeah, you know, I already got a ZDSP and all

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.640
 that stuff.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:30.040
 But having that much different effect functionality and 3 HP and stereo output.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.040
 Oh my God.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040
 Yeah.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.040
 I'm on that.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.040
 Stereo too.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040
 Yeah.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040
 Fuck.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.040
 Yeah.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040
 There you go.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040
 I'm on the train too.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.040
 Yeah.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.240
 I wanted at least two of them to run like the drum root through.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.240
 You know what I mean?

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.680
 Two different voices through once.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.840
 I love shitty sounding reverbs almost as much as distortion.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.480
 You know what I mean?

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.720
 And fortunately I don't have much hardware that does that.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.600
 Like most of that is still software for me.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.600
 Yeah.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.600
 You know.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.080
 A lot of the hardware stuff is clean.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.080
 Like super clean.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.080
 How clean could I get this?

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.120
 Like the clips that's like the haven tied stuff super clean.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.720
 But the and sonic deep before that I have that's like a dirty motherfucker.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.040
 I think that's that's like got some nasty reverbs.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.280
 I usually have like a short room reverb or a plate on that thing with some other stuff

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.280
 because you can like chain them.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.960
 But you know you have the ASR acts that think is the same effects basically.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.200
 We've discussed what we liked that came out in 2016.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.680
 We can discuss our disappointment.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.680
 Oh yeah.

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.680
 Disappointments in 2016.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.320
 Well you were I remember you were fired up for the Rainmaker and then whenever you got

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.160
 to play with one you were.

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.320
 I think it would take a long time to learn it and for what it can do.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.320
 It's huge.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:41.680
 It's probably cool but it wasn't like oh man I need to like that's the kind of thing

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.680
 that I need.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.680
 Yeah.

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.200
 I'm going to be able to kind of it and it's a hell of a hell of a large module.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.200
 Yeah.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.040
 I'm sure there's good stuff in it but maybe not too.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.160
 What's some stuff that was like you got and then went on the selling block.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.160
 I also have a I mean the diet was record speed but yeah.

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.160
 I was record speed.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:03.280
 I have to open my look at my muff sent messages.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.120
 I wish I was like like a like modular grid had a versioning so I could go back and look

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:11.160
 at like no three versions ago that's what I that's what I thought I had or thought I

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.080
 wanted or hadn't clearly don't have that anymore.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.120
 Yeah when I stumble across screenshots of previous set up something like what is this

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.120
 completely different.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.720
 Why did I think that was okay.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.720
 Yeah.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.720
 I feel like I'm just getting like my use to this modular setup too and like all these

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.320
 modules and now it's like kind of transparent.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.080
 Is there anything else on the list that we wanted to cover?

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.640
 We did want to talk about the coma.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.640
 Oh yeah let's do that.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.640
 Field kit.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.640
 As a kick.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.640
 It was a kickstarter.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.640
 It's still going.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.640
 Yes.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.120
 Are you sure because you can't actually get you can't order any of the kits anymore.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.920
 Yeah I think they're sold out but the kickstarter I think is still active.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:53.280
 They hit their goal within 24 hours and since then they've like well surpassed it.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.400
 Right but they're not referring to anything that people have backed it.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.760
 I don't think it matters.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.360
 You can't just stop a project which is why people were pushing for like watch it go

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.640
 up another thousand dollars just sitting here.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.640
 Yes dude it's just ridiculous.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.640
 $284,000.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.960
 Yeah their goal was 21,000.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.960
 Yeah it's insane.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.400
 I mean I think they added a whole nother batch.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.040
 It looks like you won't get it until May but I don't know if anybody will.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.040
 We're supposed to.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.880
 They sent an update to everyone who backed it so far saying like they're still keeping

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:30.560
 on track with their original deadline or ship date which I think was March for anyone

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.320
 who ordered like the first like 100 batch or something.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.600
 Super early bird kits are no longer available.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.000
 So anything beyond that I don't think it's going to be shipped to like May.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 That's not too bad.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 It does come in March.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.320
 The first ship there is in March and then the new ones.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.920
 Yeah you can still get those.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.600
 So field recording mixed in with you know noise mixing feedback like all this little

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.600
 package.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.440
 Yeah it's got the radio tuners in there.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.440
 This is cool.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.440
 I'll hop on it you know and then like I hit refresh the next day so came back to work and

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.400
 like just refresh the page to see how it was doing.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.120
 It was like it just blew off.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.120
 That's awesome.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.120
 Holy shit.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.480
 There's a lot of people out there interested in making some noise.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.920
 I think that's fucking cool.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.480
 I don't even know what else you would use that for.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.800
 Like that is a noise making kit.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.800
 Or maybe like an ambient.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.680
 I can see people using it to make ambient doing some more channel mix.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.000
 Like stand alone like one person in an art gallery with just that.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.680
 Like yeah maybe running it through a reverb pedal or something.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.120
 Yeah I can see that.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.080
 I think a lot of the audience might beat that.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.760
 I can't it's pure speculation.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.760
 I don't know who they are.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.760
 That wasn't really what I thought of when I saw it you know what I mean.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.560
 Like I saw it and I was like this would make a nice stand alone expansion to my modular.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.760
 I especially like the little motors and stuff like that.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.760
 Yeah yeah.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:47.880
 To have all that in one little package with a mixer and all the other added shit LFOs and

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.360
 so I'm like that's fucking slick you know what I mean.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.520
 Yeah I know it's as well design.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.720
 Yeah it's well thought out and it's pretty cheap.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.760
 It's like affordable for people to get into whereas a lot of modular stuff is not.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.760
 Yeah true.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:04.080
 Like 300 bucks that's like the cost of one module and yet it does the things of like

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.080
 six different models.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.080
 Yeah yeah.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.880
 Does it work off battery too?

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.400
 That I don't know.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.560
 Because that would be amazing too to actually have a completely portable thing.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560
 Nine volt PSU.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.360
 Yeah yeah so I guess it would work off a nine volt battery.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360
 Fuck.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.200
 So you just walk around that thing headphones came out of nowhere too.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.360
 You know what I mean like once I saw it I was like oh I'm hyped for this.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.360
 You know what I mean.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.540
 Something that I had no idea even existed before now I'm like very looking forward to

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.540
 March so I could play with it.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.740
 They're good designers.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.720
 All their shit is like that a sequence is still rad.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:40.880
 No thing I kind of lost over that's new that I won't get is that WMD performance mixer.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.680
 Yeah I think that's fucking great.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.680
 Yeah.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.040
 It's huge and it is like very expensive but yeah.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.120
 Isn't there an expansion expansion already for it?

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.120
 Yeah with the mutes.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.120
 Yeah everything.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.120
 Yeah.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.600
 Because that was my we're looking at like I'll be cool there was mutes.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.760
 He's like we got you covered fam.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.760
 You want mutes?

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.760
 We got fucking mutes.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.740
 But like stereo, aux-cent and return I think.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:02.740
 Yeah it just seems like.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:06.340
 Yeah I had a feeling I have a feeling like if I had that it would just like be my main

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.340
 mixing console.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.140
 Yeah I mean not just the modular I'll probably run everything through that shit.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.700
 Yeah because it'll take flying level too.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.900
 Yeah it's fucking smart.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.900
 It is smart.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.820
 They're all VCA's too.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.580
 Because you could CB controller or each channel.

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.580
 And the volume.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.220
 Damn it don't make me look at that thing again.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.220
 It's huge.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.460
 It's huge and I don't even think it could fit in that gap you have there.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.460
 Yeah.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:30.120
 It would have to be like in a separate fucking rack or something.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.120
 I mean ornament and crime.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.120
 Oh yeah.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.120
 He's got one coming.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:38.160
 Yeah that's that's the more I look at what it does the more crazy it seems.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.160
 And they still work on it.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.160
 Yeah.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.160
 Because it's all open source.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.160
 There are a few people working on it.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.600
 Yeah that's that's gonna be hard not to get.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.640
 If you're if you want to build it all yourself too.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.040
 Somebody was like it's under a hundred bucks I think.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.040
 Wait seriously.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.600
 If you're gonna you know it's all this is a pretty tiny surface mount soldering.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.880
 But yeah that's that's not a big deal.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.060
 Is it all easily is it stuff you can easily get is the bill material reasonable.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:04.300
 Yeah I think that only thing that's semi tricky are the screens but there it seems like there

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.300
 are a bunch of suppliers.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.300
 Oh yeah.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.900
 Yeah notice someone asked us some questions.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:09.900
 Oh yeah.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:10.900
 In South Club.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:11.900
 Yeah on SoundCloud.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:15.380
 I'm in Muff someone asked to give more examples about feedback passion.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.300
 I would love the answer to that question.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.380
 But like it's kind of hard to do.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.380
 I don't know.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.580
 I just got to find it.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.580
 Yeah exactly.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.440
 I feel like feedback patching is kind of like circuit bending.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.200
 You know there is no definitive way to do it.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.200
 There's no.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.360
 But like circuit bending though there are these sort of like you're interested in this.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.360
 Here's like it started.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.400
 I think a lot of the feedback patching there's no good starting point.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.880
 You obviously have found it and people are trying to pick your brain.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.880
 I suppose I don't know it's just kind of hunting for things that sound good.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:44.880
 You know what I mean?

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.840
 Certain modules certain places where feedback belongs.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.640
 I ran into one today.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:55.260
 Which was piston Honda into the Polaris but also molting the piston Honda out into the

00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:00.500
 filter CV in on the Polaris and that got some like really wet kind of shit going.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.420
 Oh it was kind of fun.

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.420
 Nice.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.460
 The piston is definitely a feedback friendly module dude.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.460
 Yeah yeah.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.340
 Mark 1 and Mark 2 they're both they have some certain spots.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.740
 Mark 2 had the external input and then like the separate output.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.100
 Oh yeah.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:21.420
 So if you even if you don't have anything going into the input it sends out like a fucking

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.940
 it's like a rectified version of the main output.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.940
 Oh so.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.940
 I think I'm going to read about that.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:27.940
 Yeah.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.340
 So I used to route that to anything else on the piston dude.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:36.060
 Like the piston is just a feedback fucking powerhouse like you send that back into like

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:42.300
 the waveform CV input or the FM input or anything like that or even the fucking.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.300
 Inflation.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.300
 Yeah.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.300
 Exactly.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:46.300
 There we go.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:50.900
 Once you're getting feedback only around tour on tour Polaris a lot.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:51.900
 Okay.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:57.180
 I was feedbacking Polaris in different ways from other sources off the top of my head.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:03.700
 I remember I had the output of braids malted to an attenuator and then that was going back

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:11.260
 into the FM input and I think the timber input very mildly on top of going to the FM on the

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.340
 Polaris that it was being routed into.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.380
 Now when you were doing that did you have to could you just set the attenuator to the

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.340
 value that was working or were you constantly playing with that.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.940
 Once you have it attenuated like through the mixer you don't have to fuck with it.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.940
 Oh gosh.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.940
 So it doesn't start getting squelchy.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.180
 It doesn't start getting out of control.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.180
 It can.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.700
 Like I had a sound check it carefully every night and listen to see if everything was still

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:34.140
 where it was supposed to be and more of times than not it wasn't.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:38.180
 So like I had to just dial a bag and that's the crazy thing about feedback too.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.500
 You never always get the same thing that you heard the first time.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.500
 You know what I mean?

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.700
 It's weird and it is a learning.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.700
 Yeah.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.700
 How about it?

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.700
 Yeah.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.700
 You know it's the ghost in the machine.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.700
 You know what I mean?

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:54.660
 It's turned your cold calculated machinery into something that's chaotic a living creature.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.820
 But yeah that's one example off the top of my head.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.420
 I'd have to think of more.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.220
 The herb herb I had that feeding back into itself.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:08.060
 It was like a no input and then I had CV hitting the mix on the dry wet on the feedback.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:13.540
 The herb even has the CV out which is generated from whatever the fuck is going on on the

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:17.300
 module and then I can route that into things like the tilt.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.500
 So it's essentially generating its own CV into tilt which is adjusting the sound of

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.580
 it which is in turn adjusting the CV of it.

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.580
 So it's just like an endless weird CV loop.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.460
 It's trying to generate based on what it's doing.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.700
 You know it just little subtle things like that.

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:32.700
 You know what I mean?

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.060
 It didn't make like huge differences in the tone but just I guess one thing a lot of people

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:40.980
 won't do maybe off the bat is put like an attenuator between the signal and instead

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.580
 it will just route it to react and think like oh this is nuts.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.420
 Yeah you kind of got to attenuate sometimes.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.180
 A lot of times yeah.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.380
 Some shit you can just go nuts with it.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.020
 Yeah attenuation very key.

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.100
 It's one reason why I still have blinds in there.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.860
 It's not the most exciting module but it's pretty helpful module when it comes to like

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:05.540
 attenuating and even inverting feedback you know or whatever you want to feed into something

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:06.540
 else.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.740
 I could probably give a shout out to Scott Harvissman on that one.

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:13.460
 He kind of really opened my eyes to the world of feedback when I first started getting into

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:14.460
 modular.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:18.940
 Like I didn't even really know what it was until you know just seeing how he always mentioned

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:22.420
 that he liked the build modules that were feedback friendly.

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:23.420
 You know what I mean?

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:27.300
 Like he had the whole thing it was the Evan feedback console and things like that.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.300
 You know what I mean?

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.300
 I had a bunch.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:34.740
 Yeah the Matrix mixer and the expansion for it which you could route a pedal into it

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.740
 and then back out.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:40.100
 Like I had a bunch of pedals at the time and I never routed my pedals into itself before

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.140
 and I was like oh fuck it I'm going to buy those modules and give it a shot and I did

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.780
 it and they were just like open the world for me.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.780
 You know what I mean?

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.780
 I was like this is cool you know what I mean?

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:49.780
 That's awesome.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.180
 Suddenly pedals that I haven't even touched in like a year or two were now a staple in

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:57.540
 my setup routing this thing into itself turning it into a fucking feedback machine.
