00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 [Music]

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Speaking of Dennis Novocaine, Nam.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 [Laughter]

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 I'm so sweet.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Speaking of Dumpster fires.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 [Laughter]

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Nam 2020.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Have we ever established that we don't actually go to this?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 I feel like it's never been clear that we never--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 We're there in spirit.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Right, but we're not actually participating.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 No.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Which is for the best, because I do kind of feel like I might have a full panic attack.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 It's like being in the biggest guitar center ever.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 But you're going to get sick there too.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Yeah.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 So everyone gets sick.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Yeah.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 I think every convention has that problem.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 I'd rather spectate--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Yeah.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 --germ free through YouTube.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Sonic State was kind of killing it this year.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 They interviewed everyone.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Yeah, they did.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 They even talked to the MIDI 2.0 guy.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 I didn't see that.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Sweet.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 [Laughter]

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 They were talking to dudes who were just doing software stuff.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 They really had nothing to say, but they were clearly excited that someone came over to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 interview them.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 I was like, "Oh, yeah, we got lanes now.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Look, you changed the colors."

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Yeah.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 It's like the omnisphere people at NobCon.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 It's like you can't even remember that they're there because it's like, "Why the fuck are you here?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Nobody wants to check this out at all.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 You can download the demo, right?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Like, the fuck you hear?"

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 But yeah, now.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 A bunch of new shit.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Yeah, there is.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And a bunch of old shit that's new again.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Old shit, that's most of it, I swear.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 And that's most of what I think I'm interested in.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 With a few exceptions, but a lot of new old shit.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 MPC1, which like, there's like this wave of me liking it and not liking it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 I think about it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 I'm like, "What the fuck am I going to do with that?"

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 And the next day I'm like, "Oh, that's fucking great.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 That's what I always wanted an MPC to be."

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 And then it's like, "What the fuck am I going to do with it?"

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 I don't know.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 It looks cool, but it's like so similar to what is it, the live that they have now?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Yeah, I think a ton of them.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 But it doesn't have the hard drive.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 It's like the same shit in a different configuration.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 It doesn't look that much smaller, but it kind of is.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 I don't know what looks cool.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 It's got less I/O.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 And the screen looks nice.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 The screen looks nice.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 It is literally the exact same screen as the other one.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 The force.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Or the live.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Yeah, they even said that it's the same one.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 So it's interesting that they made it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 It's definitely cheaper.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 About like three or four hundred bucks.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 It looks cool.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 It's like they kind of went for the Digitact.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Yeah.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 I haven't read up on any of them in a few months, but last night, look, they were kind of

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 unifying the OS across the board.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Did that ever happen?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 I think so.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Because you can load those projects.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 You can apparently do all the shit just on a PC too.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 And you can take those projects and just load them outright onto the computer.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 And it'll just play it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Same effects in VSTs or plugins and shit like that.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 So how does that work with the fact that the hardware models are different and have different

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 features?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 Probably processing power.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 I know some of them, it's like I/O.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Like the X, the big one has like a shit ton of knobs.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 And the live has more outs and ins or something like that.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 Okay.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 And the one is just like stereo out.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 And the one has CV and gate.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Yeah, like fucking eight.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Four pairs of CV gate, which is pretty fucking crazy.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 That's a lot of shit.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 But I guess like people are learning now, you're going to want to throw some CV gate on there

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 for people.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 It's probably not that expensive to do it like circuit wise, you know?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Yeah.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 It's not like a DSP chip or any shit you need.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 It's just you just need to fucking DAC to send some voltages out and write to do it in the software.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Now, was it all output or was there any input?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 All output.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 And you know, unlike the Digitact, it's got like just full effects per channel and shit.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 I'm assuming you can just stack as many effects as you have CPU for on each drum or whatever.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 So that's cool.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 Whereas the Digitact in most of that stuff is like you get an effects send, you know?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 That's about it.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 No, electron presence.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Speaking of Digitact, it was totally anything mentioned.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 I don't think.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Yeah, there were rumors, of course, going up to it, but I didn't see anything materialized there.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 So wait, what else did people have?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 We're staying on the good.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 I was going to say let's start with the good.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 I mean, because my next mic opened up with something positive.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 We'll continue down that room.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Mine is on.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 I don't know if this is going to be controversial or not.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 The form S ensemble.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 I don't think that's comfortable.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Okay.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Well, next on my list.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Yeah.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Or is the top of my list for good stuff.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Yeah.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 This isn't the top of my list, actually.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 The, the E-NOSC.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 The what?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Yeah.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 The what?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Ensemble.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Ensemble.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Oscillator.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 The E-NOSC.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 I hate it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 I hate it.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 I hate it.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 I'm never calling it that way.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 You're not going to get a 4MS E-NOSC, Dave?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 No, I will be getting a 4MS ensemble oscillator.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Okay.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 No, I'm not.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 It's not an acronym.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 No, it's not an acronym and it's not a abbreviation or an initialization.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Like it has a specific thing where you can't.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 It's not a trademark.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 It's a Wombow.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 It's not a copyright.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 It's a Wombow combo.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 I'm not a Wombow.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 In any case, I'm not fucking calling it that.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Also, like the pleasure you were having in saying it was disgusting.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.920
 I saw it written that way like one place and it just, I was like, I have to put that in

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.840
 my notes, just that is horrible.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.920
 I didn't know it would trigger you, but that just makes it even more fun to say no.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.920
 It's pretty much always that.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.920
 It's going to be the E-NOSC, no.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.920
 Yeah.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920
 For sure.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.680
 So the E-NOSC, what does it do?

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.280
 Not both of you.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.760
 It's an ensemble oscillator in E-NOSC.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.760
 So what is it?

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.720
 16 different independent oscillators?

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.240
 But I would wonder if that's like variable.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.840
 How does the Odessa compare it?

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.720
 Because that does like, is the Odessa just stack partials or is it like copies from an

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720
 oscillator?

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720
 It's partials.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.720
 Okay.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.320
 I'll jump in streams there, but I think of those two kind of things.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.760
 And you can stack voices on the Odessa.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.120
 It goes, I think, one, three, five.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.120
 Okay.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.120
 Different voices.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.720
 Like super soft kind of.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.720
 Okay.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.720
 Gotcha.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.600
 So yeah, you can stack the voices on Odessa.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.360
 I've only owned the Odessa for a little while.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.320
 And like on paper, I was trying to compare it to the ensemble oscillator.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:58.000
 There seems to be some crossover there, but they also both seem to be really different.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 You know what I mean?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.200
 This kind of focuses on the whole super amount of partials you can bring into it and all

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.000
 that jazz, whereas the ensemble seems to be more like focused on the chord aspect.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Yeah.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.400
 And it seems like you can get a little more nasty with the 4MS one.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.200
 It's got like the built in, you know, different distortion modes and all that jazz.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.520
 And the FM shit.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.160
 That was like the real clincher when I saw that at the end and heard some of those sounds.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.080
 Like fuck, because when he's like, yeah, and it'll keep the ratio from the chord structure

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.080
 of the oscillators.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.840
 And I was like, oh fuck, that's interesting.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.120
 And even the way that you present the chords was an interesting thing because that's a

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.120
 separate input.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.800
 Oh yeah, where you can like program it.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.800
 Yeah.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800
 Yeah.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.520
 So and like there was a, I think there was even like a learn button.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.240
 There's a learn button and you can activate it with a gate.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.240
 Oh really?

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.240
 Oh shit.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.240
 Nice.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240
 Yeah.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.240
 I love how when they do an idea that's kind of weird, like that they go all the way with

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.520
 it and make it something kind of totally alien and they fully think it through.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.520
 Yeah.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.240
 That's the thing to grab me the most is it seemed really well thought out.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.480
 You know what I mean?

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.280
 And Dan, the 4MS seemed really excited to talk about it and it kind of like came through,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.320
 you know, in every interview that he did.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.320
 Yeah.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.680
 And even like the like the YouTube sound demos sounded fucking great for it.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.680
 Yeah.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.120
 It sounded like a, it seemed like a lot of variety.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120
 Yeah.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.120
 Yeah.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.400
 I don't know.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.240
 I would have liked to hear more of the distortion features and the FM stuff.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.320
 That all seemed like, you know, an afterthought during some of the interviews and I was like,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320
 show me more of that please.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320
 You know what I mean?

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:40.960
 Like it definitely seems like there's a distinct character to this, you know, voice,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.840
 but I wanted to make sure it's not like a one trick pony.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.840
 You know what I mean?

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.840
 Yeah.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.840
 That's fair.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.840
 It doesn't seem like it is.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.600
 It just seems like they didn't really tap into all the other features aside from like,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.600
 you know, the high end Steppy stuff.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.600
 I was like, okay.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.800
 What I didn't notice is like, how do you pick like waveforms on it or what does it have

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.800
 available?

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.240
 Is it all like?

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.840
 I thought it was all signed, but that could be wrong.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840
 Uh, yeah.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.760
 No, it is 16 sign based oscillators.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.680
 The detune knob really impressed me.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.680
 It's doing way.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.680
 It's not going to sound like shit, you know.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.520
 I guess my main concern is I didn't want to make sure it just didn't sound pretty all

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.520
 the time.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.520
 You know what I mean?

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.520
 I didn't want to make sure it was like, I'm not going to make sure it was going to be

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.520
 a one trick pony.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:43.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:50.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:57.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:04.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:11.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:18.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:25.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.520
 I'm not going to make sure it was going to be a one trick pony.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.520
 I don't know, this design isn't as exotic as that one, even the look of it.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.520
 Whereas that one was pretty over the top light show.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.520
 I wonder if they wanted to make something that wasn't quite a $600.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.520
 I don't know how much it is, but like six oscillator thing.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.520
 300 I think.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.520
 Yeah, that one's the new one's like 300.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.520
 They even said they wanted to price it so that everyone could have it, which was fucking cool.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.520
 Yeah, $2.99.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.520
 That's insane for an oscillator that complicated, in my opinion.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.520
 Whereas their last two were almost twice that, but they were also way more.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.520
 The Odessa's twice that.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.520
 It's kind of a bummer.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.520
 Yeah, that's the same due to me the topographic.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:18.520
 If there's one thing about the topographic, because it was really straightforward, you could get up and running in a couple minutes with that thing.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.520
 That was it.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.520
 It was nice snowmen use.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.520
 Fish straightforward.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.520
 Yeah, I feel like as far as modules go, that thing kind of stole the show.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.520
 I've got a different one.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.520
 My top one.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.520
 Yeah.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.520
 Which one?

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:41.520
 The noise engineering does MODIS Versio, their stereo DSP platform.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.520
 That's your number one?

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.520
 That's my number one.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.520
 Because that's at my bottom.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.520
 Do we have to fight?

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.520
 Is this how does this work?

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.520
 No, no, go ahead.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.520
 I wanted it to be at my top.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.520
 When I saw that it was announced, I was very excited.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.520
 I was like, noise engineering finally getting into the effects world, and wanting that for a while.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.520
 Well, I would do it.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.520
 Something I can run my BIA through.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.520
 It has a cohesive sound.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.520
 But those demos were fucking horrible.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.520
 Really?

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.520
 I could not stand those demos, especially the first one.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.520
 Dude was just literally running static through a reverb.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.520
 Yeah, that was so bad.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.520
 No, there's...

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.520
 And I don't remember which video it was.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.520
 There was one or two of them.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.520
 I'm like, fuck, this sounds great.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:29.520
 And also the idea of a platform and adding new algorithms to it and it being this sort of

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.520
 evolving ecosystem of different effects was very appealing.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.520
 I split my stuff up between good, bad, ugly.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.520
 And I put that one under ugly.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.520
 Not because I feel like the module is going to be bad.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.520
 I just felt like the presentation was so bad that it kind of did not make me want to buy it.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.520
 I'm still going to hold out hope that it sounds better than those demos.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:02.520
 Whoever that guy was presenting it didn't do a good job of talking about all that it's

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.520
 capable of or doing a decent sound demo.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.520
 This fucking nail polish, dude.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.520
 So chipped.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.520
 It was horrible.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.520
 I was like, you know you're going to be doing demos of a module.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.520
 The whole world is going to be staring at your hands and you can't even put on a fresh

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.520
 coat.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.520
 You know what?

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.520
 I take it back now because I didn't know that.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.520
 Right.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.520
 Exactly.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.520
 That's bullshit.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.520
 You see what I'm saying, dude?

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.520
 No, no, I'd--

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.520
 File under ugly.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.520
 Sorry.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.520
 Seriously, I can't believe I missed that.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.520
 Invalid module.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520
 Validates.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.520
 Anything positive about the module when you're looking at someone's chipped, cracked fingernail

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.520
 polish, Dave.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.520
 But in any case, I have high hopes for this.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.520
 What's their main, like-- so I didn't see this from when they were selling it.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.520
 So it's like a platform.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.520
 What does it come with though?

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.520
 That's like different.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.680
 Because they usually have an angle and that's almost like a little bland for them.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.520
 Is it like spin DSP or whatever the FV--

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.520
 It comes with three algorithms that you can bounce between.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.520
 Okay.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.520
 It was reverb delay in comb.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.520
 Comb is the other one.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.520
 Yeah.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.240
 Which I like my comb field, especially after the bionic lister, it was like open new doors

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.160
 for me in that regard, you know.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.520
 Come to the land of comb filters.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.520
 Yeah.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.520
 Before, I was always like, you know, so-so about them, but now I'm kind of using them more.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:24.520
 And it would be fun to be able to bounce between like reverb delay comb, you know, using CV.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.520
 Oh, like BIA mode switching kind of thing.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.080
 Yeah, it can-- yeah, exactly.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.960
 You can do that, which had me interested.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.080
 And I guess you could probably program any three effects to do that with bounce through

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.080
 23 different streams.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.080
 Yeah.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.080
 Yeah.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.080
 Yeah.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080
 The other ones that they had were less exciting to me.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.080
 And it was-- it seemed like there was a similar idea.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:47.440
 And it's the vert deter, which is going to be a similar sort of like oscillator platform,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.440
 which I don't know.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.840
 It seemed like a cool idea, but- Oh, other modules.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.840
 I think about other modes.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.840
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no platform.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.840
 I got you.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:00.760
 Yeah, they released an Esterio oscillator, which didn't seem to have too many bells or

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.840
 whistles, aside from the fact that it's stereo on that you could reprogram it essentially.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.840
 Yeah.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.040
 And then the other one was that MIDI converter, which was, I don't understand why they made

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.040
 that.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.280
 I mean, are they maybe going towards a full system someday?

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.960
 Yeah, that's the only thing that- Why you would add to that already?

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.960
 Very crowded.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960
 Okay.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.320
 I guess there are two camps of people, and I know which one we fall in, but there are

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.000
 some people that do want, like, "I want a full system by one manufacturer," which when

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.960
 I think about it, it's like, "Oh, that's like the antithesis of why."

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.960
 Okay.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.920
 That kind of defeats the purpose of going modular in my place.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.160
 It is funny, though, because like, when a played shows where people come up afterwards

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.600
 and asked me, "Oh, is this a make noise system?"

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600
 Right.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.600
 I'm like, "No, no, no."

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.600
 Just say yes.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.600
 Yeah.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.600
 And I've said, "No."

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.440
 I've got like, "Oh, make noise model," and the second I said, "No."

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.680
 They just walked away.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.440
 That was just their awkward way of asking if you were at Alessandro Cortini.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.760
 They're like, "Oh shit, is that him?

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.200
 Go up and see if he has a make noise system."

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200
 Oh my God.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.200
 He's so much fatter than I thought he would be.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.480
 So just jumping off that for some off topic shit.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.560
 Cortini apparently showed off the OverStayer modular channel in a video two weeks ago.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.560
 Who watched it?

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.840
 I forgot to tell you about it.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.560
 It's in the video for all of five seconds.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.560
 Some multiple people commenting on the OverStayer thread about how they're going to buy one

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.560
 now.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.560
 What?

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.560
 From that?

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.560
 Do you just do nothing with it?

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.560
 Yeah.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.560
 No, I don't get it, dude.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.800
 Anything that that dude touches people will buy because he said it was cool.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.040
 I'm like, "That is what sold you."

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.080
 That five second clip in that video where he's running a fucking 808 through it.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.320
 But yeah, I don't know.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.920
 Just not the Virof topic of NAM, but that just blew my mind.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.920
 Back on track.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:59.200
 Oh yeah, I was going to say the reverb of that, the noise engineering one.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.600
 I don't know how I felt about the sound of it.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.600
 You know what I mean?

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.080
 Aside from the crappy static demo that he gave, I was trying to get a feel for the character

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.080
 of the reverb.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.760
 I don't think they showed off the delay or the comb.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.760
 So the one demo I saw, I think they did go over the comb.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.160
 I don't remember which one it was.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.200
 I'll have to check out a few more then.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.800
 I just saw that very first demo.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.200
 It was the first one they did.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.680
 It was just static.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.320
 But it seemed like the reverb had a very shimmer quality to it.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.240
 They say that there is a...

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.640
 That's kind of what one of the things they were going for was shimmer.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.760
 Like if you go out there and like their text blur for it actually includes shimmer as well

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.760
 in the words.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.320
 I didn't hate it though.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.080
 Personally, I'm not too into shimmer.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.080
 Yeah.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.080
 I was kind of hoping they would go for like a dirtier like 80s like...

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.240
 I feel like I got that base cover though.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.240
 Yeah.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.720
 That's why I don't need another one of those.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.320
 And I like the idea of having like their take on shimmer is appealing to me.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.320
 Sure.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.160
 I can see that.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.680
 I like shimmer but I have like one thing that does it and that's all I ever need it for.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.520
 You know I don't use it all the time because it's so particular that sound.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.720
 And I was real disappointed with the Sean Costello shimmer card for ZDSP.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.720
 Oh yeah?

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.720
 Yeah.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.320
 Like I basically never end up using it.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.160
 And I was really looking forward to it.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.160
 See you.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.160
 And I just...

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.160
 It didn't click with me.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.600
 I thought the card was good but it just made me realize that I don't like shimmer.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600
 Right.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.600
 You know what I mean?

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.600
 I was like...

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.960
 I hear other people use it and I'm like yeah well that's shimmer but it's never something

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.640
 that I'm like yeah I need that in my sound.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.600
 I don't understand the use for it.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.600
 You know what I mean?

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.520
 It's such a particular like distinct thing that it's not that versatile.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.520
 You know?

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.480
 Like I wouldn't use that on drums.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.600
 I wouldn't want it on my drones.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:50.520
 Like drones I usually go for I don't know more of a slow chorus like dark tone.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.520
 You know what I mean?

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.520
 You know what I mean?

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.520
 Something that's all shimmery and like pitch shifting.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.240
 It sounds neat but it's just I don't know what the fuck I would use it for.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.400
 Maybe you have like a mother 32 and rings and braids and cactus.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.880
 You better get some goddamn shimmer.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.880
 I have that shimmery...

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.600
 How much are you like a video?

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.920
 No one's watching that shit.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.920
 Fluctuations.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.920
 Yeah.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920
 It's gonna be like a cloudy day.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.920
 Yeah but maybe some rain.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.920
 Yeah but maybe some rain.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.920
 Yeah.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920
 Like a little just a little bit.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.720
 Well I will get this and then we can tear it apart later.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.720
 You can see the early adaptor.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.400
 And you can be like you were right all along.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.400
 Okay.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.400
 Stereo in, stereo out.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.240
 I don't know I still have I still hope.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.800
 Stereo in is a nice touch.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.000
 Considering all the new tip top ones are not for whatever fucking reason.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Yeah.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.720
 The Z5000 and all that stuff echoes.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.120
 It's all mono in.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.120
 Like why?

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.320
 Yeah dark matter is also mono in.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.320
 It's just surprising.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.840
 Like why would you not have?

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.840
 Surprised by that?

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.440
 Well the dark matter not as much but any other effects process of the earth's modern

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.440
 anymore it's not the fuck.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.440
 Yeah.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.400
 Anything in the last year I feel like because there was like the idea that your Iraq and

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.800
 the system was mono was persisted for a pretty long time.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.520
 Times have changed though.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.520
 Yeah.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.520
 Especially for like time based effects you know.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.120
 If it's a distortion of course it's probably going to be mono maybe.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.920
 But you know that being said stereo is pretty awesome too.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:16.520
 And you're not necessarily going to be coming from a mono oscillator anymore.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520
 That's changed.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.520
 Yeah that's also true.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.640
 So I think like everyone should just get on fucking board.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.760
 Tip top's being stubborn.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.560
 If you want that stereo you got to get that ZDSP.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:34.760
 I think the happy nerding effects aid is going to do circles around all those new tip tops

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.760
 personally.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.760
 Did you have that?

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.120
 It's still not available in the States dude.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.640
 Like I've been waiting for months.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.760
 Analung Haven got in like a dozen of them last week and they sold out like in an hour.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.640
 And they said there's going to be another batch but he's the sole reseller for stateside.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.000
 You know who didn't fuck up like that?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Paul.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.640
 No no he did not.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.800
 He wasn't that name was he?

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.040
 I didn't see any video so I'm saying that.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.240
 Yeah he usually calls it NAMTHRACS.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.040
 He gets NAMTHRACS that so I bet he would avoid it.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.040
 That's a smart choice.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.640
 I assume he's very busy now.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.200
 Yeah he's cracking away at me.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.080
 Making them hyperiones.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.160
 Next on my tier of mildly interesting things.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.000
 I'm only mildly interested in this.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 Banger 100M.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 It's their 100 well whatever they're calling their rolling 100M clone ripoffs but they

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 have the voice module that's like VCO, VCF and VCA.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.480
 You know they said they're going to be 50 or 100 bucks and I'm like I'll try that one.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.280
 I'm still like so bittered like I can't get fired up about their shit but I'll try that

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.280
 one.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.480
 A one system 100M shit but I'm definitely not going to pay for the real thing.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.480
 Right.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.480
 I mean the system 100 has always been appealing.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.600
 It's like a giant blown out 101.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.160
 Back in the day before I started my modulus what I contemplated buying.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.160
 Someone was selling one for like it wasn't all of it obviously but it was like a chunk

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.200
 of it and I was like yeah.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.720
 It's got the juice in my opinion.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.480
 Everything I've heard it's like that fucking sounds good.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.040
 I like the interface of it you know classic rolling.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:21.000
 The sound was always good but I'm still worried about it's a $50 oscillator.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Yeah.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.800
 This thing I don't have a lot of faith that bearing was recreating the you know system

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.800
 100's sound.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.880
 I mean it definitely looks like some of them but I need to hear more demos.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.920
 But I never got like super fired up about the molecular clones when I heard them.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.280
 Like it sounded like kind of there and I think I played with it at novcon once but

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.240
 I never like and they were like kind of pricey too.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.520
 So it was like yeah.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.520
 They were kind of expensive.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.520
 Yeah.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.120
 It was meant to be more like a boutique type thing instead of like a cheap recreation which

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.360
 I guess I understand.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.680
 If I remember you'd have to spend like 900 bucks to put a voice together and shit and

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.680
 that was just like.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.720
 That's one reason why I've always enjoyed a lot of the intelligel stuff is that it's

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.480
 a lot of it is modeled not sound wise but function wise like after the classic rolling

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:14.560
 stuff like their dual envelope generators and the metropolis and the lances and all

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.560
 that shit.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.040
 This is true.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.280
 Just didn't have that sound though unfortunately.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.440
 You know what I still kind of miss sometimes that and very gate eat every so often I just

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.480
 wanted in there for a patch and then I know I wouldn't use it every day but it had it.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.480
 That was the cool one.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.480
 It was literally just thinking that yesterday.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.480
 Yeah.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.480
 I was kind of missing.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.400
 I just threw my old pictures of my imgar site where I host all the stuff that I put for

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.400
 sale.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.200
 I put them in the muff threads or whatever and I saw that and I was like I kind of missed

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200
 that thing now.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.840
 I couldn't remember why I sold it.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.000
 Then I remember I sold them when I got the vector I guess.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.280
 I was like okay this is doing all the sequencing I need but yeah I don't know.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.280
 Sometimes it would be nice to just punch something in on the.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.440
 But you know what I got?

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.440
 It said a hydrogen.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.440
 Hell yeah.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.440
 Yes.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.280
 Wait do you want to talk about the hydrogen?

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.280
 I do.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.280
 Because that's not really NAM specific.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.960
 Yeah before we dive into the hardware of Hidersense I just want to say that the interviews that

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.720
 those guys did at NAM were fucking fantastic.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720
 Yeah they were.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720
 Every fucking interview.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.720
 I was like if I didn't already own this thing I would be buying it because you're selling

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.320
 me on it like all over again with like every interview.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.600
 They just all seem so fucking genuine about their product and like just always had a lot

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.920
 of interesting things to say about it.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.440
 Yeah I like the designer dude seems cool and the two engineers were obviously like super

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.280
 knowledgeable on just how open they were to like oh yeah we're going to clone some filters

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.840
 and then dude was like I'm just going to make a machine learning model of all these different

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.840
 types of cool filters.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.840
 It's like what the fuck?

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.840
 It's a good idea.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.400
 It does it sounds really fucking good.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.400
 Yeah.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.760
 Hidersense you had the keyboard.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.760
 Had it.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.760
 You swapped for the desktop.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.760
 Had it for 24 hours yeah.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.160
 We were both on that shit pretty quickly.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.480
 The keyboard was just too damn big.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.520
 Like within a day I found myself really enjoying like the ribbon controller and stuff and the

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.480
 extra knobs but then I was like the more I learned it over the course of like the short

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.560
 24 hours that I had it I was like I don't need these extra knobs actually.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.680
 I'd rather have the more desk space available so.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.640
 What did the extra knobs give you?

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.640
 Literally just more knobs.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.640
 Yeah like okay.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.000
 But you already have eight to begin with with the desk.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 More it's eleven.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.480
 I thought it was eight that were context sensitive.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.800
 Oh yeah yeah you get the eight soft knobs and the other ones are armp and then filter.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.800
 Gotcha gotcha.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.000
 So you get like more armp knobs on the keyboard.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.080
 You get the ratcheting features are brought up to knobs.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:47.280
 But I found that I was just using the soft knobs anyways for like as soon as you touch

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.520
 anything that has to do with like the armp engine those are right there on the menu anyways.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.320
 So yeah I was like yeah I'll get the desktop instead.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:00.920
 So hit up my sweet water sales rep said hey buddy send in this back your way.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:06.440
 I think I'm just fucking heavy as fuck because the desktop version is the heaviest desktop

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.680
 so I could barely bring it into the FedEx to show.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.400
 Like I was sick and it was freezing cold I had gloves on this thing was like slipping

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.720
 out of my hands I was like please don't break this thing.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.600
 The guys just standing around the counter washing me trying to like open the door with

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:27.240
 my foot as I'm like trying to drag this big ass synth in there but yeah sent that thing

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.240
 on back.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:35.360
 Hundred pound beast it's burly it's definitely over engineered it feels sturdy shit nothing

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.680
 about it feels cheap.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.840
 Pretty impressed yeah with build quality obviously sound but like the editing of it so fucking

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.760
 awesome.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:50.080
 Obviously the mod matrix so they were super inspired by the overhimer spander and I guess

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.560
 most of them had one at one point it has like kind of the same editing and soft knob

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.560
 shit which I didn't I never had an expander.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.480
 I remember Rudman had one forever I never really paid with it.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.680
 But you can do cool shit like if you're at the modulators on the little selector thing

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.400
 you can just hold an LFO and then hit oscillator it takes you right to the mod matrix.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.400
 That kind of shit is cool.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.560
 Remember I was showing it to you the other day Dave and I was like oh it's weird to like

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.520
 so it's got these two oscillator modes there's like just oscillator with wave table shit

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.560
 and then there's wave scan where you can make like your own more between waves and

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:28.480
 I was telling you like oh you got to like edit all eight of them and you got to fill

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.160
 them all out or like if you only put two right next to each other one and two it only gives

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.600
 you like a little bit of a knob turn to like scan through it but if you hold shift I found

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.240
 out and then hit the wave table it'll start to line all the different wave tables up

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.400
 in order.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.960
 So if there's like horizon one through eight and the way they break it up on there if you

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.920
 just hold that shift button and move it over then it starts to pull everything like through

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.840
 that array so it automatically lines up all the things that are late to each other on

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.120
 the knobs and you can just sweep through that shit and I saw that and I was like that's

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.120
 fucking smart.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.720
 There's a way to make a random array too if you want.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.720
 Oh really?

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.000
 I forget how to do it off time I have it yeah you can make like your own random array that

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.520
 you can morph through now.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.520
 Nice.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.280
 Yeah and there's there's oscillators and then you have these two mutant modes on the first

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.920
 two two or three and that lets you do stuff like linear FM.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.000
 So it's almost like almost a function of the oscillator not the oscillator itself so you're

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.800
 like applying oscillator sync to this oscillator it doesn't care what type it is you're applying

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.640
 like linear FM to an oscillator that could be a wave table or square or whatever.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.560
 The pulse width though it's the same as like the waves can where you can have like you can

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:38.080
 design how it pulse widths it and so you get like you go to this edit menu you get the

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.980
 eight soft knobs for the different pulse width values and then you can modulate each one

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.560
 of those knobs.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.820
 So you can modulate in real time a pulse width that has eight different points on the wave

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.240
 form and you can modulate all those individually.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.760
 So they went deep on the sound engine.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.800
 Yeah you can do some serious sound design on this thing.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.640
 Yeah more so than anticipated.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.080
 Same you know.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.760
 It seems like you can always kind of push it into a different little territory because

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.120
 at first when you look at the oscillator you're like oh that's less parameters than

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.680
 like a complex euro oscillator.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:15.080
 It's really like the way those mutant things work and then all the modulation and the

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.840
 fact that it sounds like really good when you modulate that shit like it's really like

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.600
 it all works together very well.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:25.280
 It should but you know it's like feels very cohesive the way the stuff interacts and it

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.080
 feels like you can keep pushing it in different territories.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.320
 It's pretty cool.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.320
 And everything unless you're demonstrating to me see musical.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.400
 Is everything geared towards being musical or can you make things that are just chaos.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.400
 You can fuck it up.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.960
 You can definitely push it.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.640
 Because we were it's got effects and we were talking well at least I was I was like that

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.520
 doesn't have distortion and Greg's like I don't need that anyway.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.640
 Which I was like yeah that makes sense after the fact.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.520
 But the filter distortion is really cool and that lets you kind of open up like a lot

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.720
 of different colors.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.960
 So that kind of satisfied me.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.480
 I'm like oh I can overdrive this and you've got the tons of different filter types so

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.680
 that gives you like a lot of room and you get two filters and you can change the routing.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.800
 And I think we were all fooled by the fact that and maybe that was even on a podcast

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.680
 but I thought it was like multi-temporal.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.840
 I thought you got like eight layers of voices if you wanted but it's really just one voice

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840
 up to eight note poly.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.840
 Right.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:22.000
 I think we said on the previous episode that it was multi-voice but it turns out it's not.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.800
 Which I'm not sure why we all thought that.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.800
 Yes.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.960
 Swerves said that somewhere.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.760
 Maybe I just misunderstood the write up or maybe that has changed since it's gone into

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.000
 production but maybe that's something they'll add later.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.960
 Yeah maybe because I remember I got it and hit the voice button in the upper right and

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.960
 I was like oh that's going to let me.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.360
 It's like no it doesn't do anything at all like that.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.120
 It lets you tune the voice basically.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.880
 So that being said I still fucking super dig it.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880
 Yeah.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.800
 I saw somebody did a pretty good comparison of that in the Chira from Waldorf.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.920
 They were like oh I had both for a period of time and they kept talking about how editing

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.040
 the Chira was kind of a fucking nightmare.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.040
 Like we were talking about.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.800
 They were like yeah you just never it seems like totally awkward the way you've got to

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.560
 edit this thing and it's like everything's kind of disconnected and all these like different

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.400
 menus and I was like cool.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.160
 I don't fucking want that at all.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:16.160
 I really just want a blow felt with multi-mode where it has discrete effects on each channel.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.160
 If they could have made that that would be no brainer.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.520
 But yeah I would say I'm compared to sold my mini log XD to help fund the Hydrosynth

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.280
 and they're like pretty close to like $150 difference and I think the Hydrosynth just

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.760
 fucking blows it out of the water.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.080
 I kind of hated the mini log XD.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.800
 Just the way it sounded.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.800
 No low end either.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.400
 So you were fired up when we did the podcast review of it though.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.360
 I'm always fired up initially.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.800
 Yeah but yeah it's true.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.560
 But I realized with that thing is like when I tried to I would play it by itself and be

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.160
 like oh that's kind of cool that's kind of cool and then want to try to make music with

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.160
 it.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:57.160
 I was like I can't get to where I want to go and I would even I took the blow felt out

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.560
 and swapped it out and like that was like oh shit I'm getting everything I need and that's

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.560
 when I put the mini log in the box.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.640
 I figured this out and then when I wanted the Hydrosynth was when I was like I'm going

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.640
 to fucking sell it.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.280
 All the demos were pretty good.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.280
 Not just the interviews but the demos that they have to.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.120
 Mylar melodies did one and one of his friends did another one.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.200
 It was like Mylar was kind of jamming out doing like you know wave table techno jams

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.680
 with it on the desktop and then there was another video of his friend next to him who

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.560
 was doing more like key stuff on the keyboard version like pads and drones and stuff.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:35.960
 It was like cool to see both you know territories being explored totally and they were just

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.520
 doing stuff on the fly and they were both come up with like interesting results so it's

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.520
 like that's pretty cool.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.720
 Yeah on the desktop version they did get the pads really right like that after touch works

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.920
 well on the velocities.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:51.400
 Awesome I've been using that to program the mini box and it's fucking great.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.400
 It works perfect.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.480
 I haven't been touching them too much.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.560
 I've been sequencing it with the modular.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.560
 Oh yeah yeah.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.680
 I haven't like tried to play it or really mess with the pads too much.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.360
 I've been sending it sequences.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.680
 I was actually wanting to score a pyramid again just for the pads and the hydro synth

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.720
 like I don't want anymore now because that has the pads that are even better than the

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:19.360
 pyramid and I can just point those to the MIDI box and that's what I wanted anyway.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.720
 So how about that 2600?

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.560
 And no I'm not talking about the Atari game console.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.960
 Or the hacker quarterly magazine.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:34.120
 Yeah damn it Dave here one step ahead of my joke.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.280
 Which 2600 are you talking about because I hear there too?

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.120
 I'm talking about both.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.120
 Oh shit.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.440
 Let's talk about the official one first.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.440
 The cork one?

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.440
 Yeah.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.440
 The carp.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.440
 26.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.160
 I like my carp Odyssey.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.560
 That's one that I kind of was into but maybe wasn't for me but it was a solid it fucking

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.040
 sounded good.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.160
 So do you want to get a carp 2600?

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.160
 Yeah.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.160
 Good good.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.160
 Yeah.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.920
 Apparently they're only making like a hundred of them.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.920
 Yeah.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:16.520
 And like people are getting refunded already and like people that told they made the list

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:20.440
 or not being refunded and being too bad you know.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.440
 That's wack.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.440
 Yeah.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.640
 So super limited.

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.520
 No idea why.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.560
 And because I mean clearly the demand is there.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.560
 Yeah.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.080
 Like people got pretty excited about this.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.960
 But yeah super limited $4,000 price tag.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.400
 Which I think is right on par with like the TTSH.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.400
 Yeah.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.400
 Really makes.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.160
 I mean those weren't full size but they were pretty good in my opinion.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.160
 Yeah.

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.320
 Maybe might even prefer that something a little right.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.600
 A little more compact right.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.280
 I was thinking the same thing.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.960
 But yeah after seeing like how much of a pain you ask is going to be to get one and

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.880
 the price tag and all that I've rolled that out completely.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.880
 But looks awesome.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:12.080
 I can't believe someone's finally doing like a full size accurate remake of it.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:20.560
 So obviously Beringer is going to be there to swoop in on the all the broken hearted.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:26.240
 Rejected people weren't getting one of the real deals.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.960
 They still haven't announced a price for the Beringer version or like an ETA.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.360
 All they did was release a couple of those videos during name with the what's his name.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.760
 Rob Kebel, the guy from AMS.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.760
 Right right right.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.760
 Her name sense rather.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.760
 Yeah.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.840
 They did like two video interviews with him talking about it and showing it off a little

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.840
 bit.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.080
 The thing about price or one it's expected to come out.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.800
 He didn't really hint at anything like that.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.840
 He just said like he came into the process halfway through when like the prototype was

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.000
 in really rough form.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.840
 They brought him in to like whip it into shape and make it sound good.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.640
 And I didn't have any faith in it until I saw it was him.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.640
 You know what I mean?

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.640
 I'm like okay.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.520
 I was like maybe this would actually sound good.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.760
 It's compact.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.840
 It's rack mountable.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.920
 You can throw it in like a 19 inch mixer rack.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.480
 You could like put it under the table if you wanted.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.600
 You know anywhere where it fit.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:27.400
 It doesn't seem to come with a keyboard or speakers which I'm totally fine with.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.480
 But yeah it looked alright.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.400
 Looked like a rave machine with all the crazy LEDs but he showed that like you can dim those

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.120
 to the point where you can actually turn them completely off if you want.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.120
 Oh cool.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.120
 So it's good to hear.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.120
 Yeah.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.640
 So it can just be completely dark just all sliders.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.640
 I'm a little interested in it.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.640
 You know what I mean?

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.000
 If he was involved like we were saying that that bodes a while he's been cloning that

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.920
 shit forever.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:56.920
 And a lot of vintage filters and all that doing an accurate job with it.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.680
 And the cork is just not going to be obtainable.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.600
 So it'll be obtainable but for like four times the fucking price on reverb I'm sure.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.160
 So that's 20 grand.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.160
 Yeah.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.720
 That's the question now is what's your guess.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.080
 I've got my guess.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.320
 We can make a prediction right now.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.480
 I'm going to go for it.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.640
 One year $1,000.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.720
 It'll take them a full year to do it and it'll cost a grand.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.880
 I don't think they can do it for a grand.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.240
 I think it's going to be $1,500.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.520
 That's my guess is $1,500.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.160
 Just there's too much going on.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.640
 I can see that.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.640
 Yeah.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.640
 No.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.800
 Yeah I think you're most of I would agree with that somewhere between one to 15.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.800
 Yeah.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.040
 You got to say a fucking number.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.440
 Put your fucking money down.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.440
 $12.99.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.440
 $12.99.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.600
 That's my final bid there.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.600
 Right.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.280
 So we edged you up in true prices right now.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.280
 Right.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.280
 So your window's short.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.280
 $1.99.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.280
 $1.99.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.280
 Ah.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.280
 Yeah.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.280
 I think $12.99.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.280
 Yeah.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.960
 I don't know what anybody wins but probably not one of those.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:59.840
 But even $12.99 would actually, I think that would be fair if it sounded good.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.840
 What's there?

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.680
 What are those deep mind shits cost?

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.160
 They're like 400 bucks.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.160
 Oh, we finished.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.160
 Yeah.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.160
 They're cheap dude.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160
 They're like $3.99 or something like that.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.360
 I forgot to mention the Barringer version comes with extra shit.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.360
 Oh.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.520
 It's not like a true one to one remake.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.600
 It has two different selectable filter modes.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.080
 Oh, that is cool.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:26.080
 It has a sync to ask two and three.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.360
 And there's pulse with modulation.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.200
 And it's doo-fonic.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.800
 That's some of the stuff that Rob has added.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.960
 Yeah, it's got the two of this version.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.160
 Pre and post lawsuit filters.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.160
 Mm-hmm.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.480
 I thought that was a nice touch.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.000
 All right, so I've got some less than flattering things.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.920
 We want to move to the less than flattering things.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.320
 I was going to bring up two more things that I thought was good.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.320
 All right.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.320
 What would you call it?

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.040
 There aren't even that many things in the world that are good.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.040
 Yeah, seriously.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.360
 These are towards the bottom of the list now but still decent.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:04.280
 While we're on the subject of overly priced old new shit, the Corrigan has 20 remakes.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.960
 Oh, how much are there?

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:14.680
 1,400, which is about twice as much as I'd be willing to spend on a basic mono.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.040
 I mean, I love the MS-20.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.040
 And I was excited to see it.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.960
 But that price was just like, fuck.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.960
 I could just get a baron drawer at this point.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.880
 Why can't we just make it available?

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.240
 And that's the thing too.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.120
 It's that expensive and it's limited.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.120
 It's a limited run.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.120
 You have to--

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.120
 What's with these limited runs?

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.120
 No idea.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.200
 I mean, they're acting like there's no fucking demand for this.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.840
 People haven't been demanding this for 40 fucking years now.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.800
 Like, I don't know.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:44.440
 Is it to generate buzz and create this artificial scarcity?

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.320
 Is it basically just building a mystique?

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.320
 Maybe?

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.560
 This is the third re-release they've done of this synth.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.560
 There was the mini.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.120
 Then there was the M desktop kit.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.120
 Now there's these.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.200
 And clearly there's demand there.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:03.280
 I just fucking released them, do a big old production run of them.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.800
 At this point, you could just always have them in production.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.760
 I mean, it's something that you could just be making for a while.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.400
 Just flood the market with the desktop on with the mods.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.400
 Yeah.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.960
 It's like, that seems like that would cover it all.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:18.200
 This newest version doesn't even have the mods that the desktop does.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.800
 Like, it lacks some of the stuff that the M has.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.320
 Don't know why.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.920
 I got excited and I figured it'd be like all on there.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.200
 Nope.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.200
 But it comes in four optional colors.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200
 I did see that.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.200
 Blue.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.200
 One of the colors.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:37.160
 Blue, green, black, and white.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.560
 And the white does look dope.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.560
 I can't deny it.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:40.560
 Yeah.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.560
 It does look like a stormtrooper.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.560
 It does.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.560
 Yeah.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.560
 It's a beautiful little box.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:49.840
 I was like, man, that's like my dream, you know, MS-20 right there.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.000
 Looking all shiny and white.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.480
 Like, I don't know what it is about synths in white, dude, but it just like, it always

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.480
 grabs me.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.480
 Yeah.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.480
 Even my patch cables, Dave.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.480
 Like, I'm white.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.480
 I'm looking at the...

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.720
 I'm literally looking at them right now.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.720
 You've got to look like it's from a...

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.720
 Space.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.720
 You know what though?

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.800
 Like, you know, whenever you perform, you know they're not white because the lights

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.120
 and shit on the modular are changing them.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.360
 They're not white when you're performing.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.360
 Oh, I know that, Dave.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.000
 I just want to make sure you know that that's how color works.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 Okay.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 Light and color.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 They reflect.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 They reflect.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 They do.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 Yeah.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.200
 That's one reason why I've always liked white gear live because it helps pick up all the colors

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.880
 and projections that are going on.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.520
 Where is that blue MS20 looks like?

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.520
 Shit.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.520
 It kind of does.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.520
 Yeah.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.520
 It looked like a fucking toy.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.360
 I saw that and I was like, what the fuck?

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.360
 It's all the other ones.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.360
 It's a really weird color.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.360
 Green one.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.360
 Okay.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.360
 It's not like...

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.360
 I don't know.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.360
 It's not like an MS...

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.360
 I mean, a SH01 Blues.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.360
 Yeah.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.360
 It's kind of like...

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.360
 It's like a royal...

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.360
 It's like...

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.360
 It doesn't...

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.360
 It's a blue synthesizer should not be.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.880
 Like, an icing on a cake type of blue.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.880
 I don't know.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.880
 It was, yeah, it was strange.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.600
 I was excited and then I wasn't.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:03.040
 Once I saw it lacked some of the mods and the price tag was a little steep.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.040
 So we were right.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.040
 This didn't belong on the good list.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.040
 I mean, it's good but it's...

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.240
 The fuck are you telling?

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.960
 It's not something I'm going to be getting probably.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:09.960
 You know what I mean?

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.280
 Frustrating T's good.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.280
 Yeah.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.120
 Like, oh, this is good but it's actually bad.

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.440
 It's good because the synths coming back out again.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:23.040
 It's the type of synth that is like, I think, the perfect synthesis learning tool.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:28.200
 Like, I would love to see an MS-20 in like every fucking kids music classroom or library.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.200
 You know what I mean?

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.200
 I thought they made the big one.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.200
 Yeah.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.200
 They had that big one.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.200
 Exactly.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.920
 So it's like kind of cool that it's coming out.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.640
 People will be able to get these again, you know, things like that.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:42.080
 But yeah, I'm not going to shell out 1400 to own one but I'm kind of glad that it exists.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.520
 Maybe it'll knock a few desktop mod ones loose because somebody always wanted a full size.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.440
 A couple already popped up on the market because I was paying attention.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.440
 Yeah.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.040
 But the fact that they're popping up is cool.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.040
 Yeah.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.320
 And even if it's at an inflated price.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.480
 And I've tried to pay attention to the prices of those for a while.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.120
 They seem to fluctuate widely.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:07.280
 Like, I guess it depends on what people think, you know, they're worth.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.240
 Yeah, like that core wave state seems like it tanked the prices of that mini log XD

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.960
 because I was trying to sell that and like, I dropped like the overall reverb price by

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.600
 a certain amount just because I went under this one dude and then everybody else like

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:26.040
 right on the bottom and then I was like, oh, finally got it out there though.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.040
 But yeah, this thing, I don't really get it.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.520
 Well, the wave statement, it's a new wave station, right?

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.520
 Exactly.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.160
 I'm not like, I used to use the VST a bit.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.640
 I would still use it if I had to, but I did it for like two sounds and I'm not going to

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.880
 like program that thing.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.920
 I did like the little onboard sequencer functions that it had and look kind of cool.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.760
 Yeah, the way you can do some like polyrhythmic stuff with it and things like that.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.320
 I thought that was a nice touch.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.560
 There's probably people out there that are really fired up for it.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560
 Yeah, there are.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.480
 For me, like I saw it and I couldn't eat it was like hard to read the details.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.720
 I was so bored by it.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.040
 It just kind of got to be chill.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.040
 And it felt bad.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.480
 I was like, oh, you should like this.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.680
 But it's like, I don't even want to fucking look at it.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.680
 Yeah.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.000
 That reminds me of the other thing that was on my list.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.880
 This is also good or like your version of good that's not really good.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.200
 Well, I mean, I didn't want to file that under ugly or bad.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.400
 Well, this one I think is definitely good.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.640
 Twisted Electron's Mega FM.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.320
 Oh, the Sega FM chip one.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.320
 Oh, yes.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.800
 That was that YM something chip.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.800
 Yeah.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.320
 I think I dropped down the chip.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.080
 I can never remember the number either.

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.400
 That was awesome.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:36.480
 The YM 2612 FM chip.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.960
 Yeah, the Genesis chip.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:41.120
 You see this found in the Mega Drive and the Genesis.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.120
 Mm-hmm.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.120
 Well, they both used that chip.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.120
 I didn't realize that.

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.200
 You're talking about the original Mega Drive or--

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.200
 Because what was the--

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.200
 You got the Master System.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.200
 Master's US version.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.200
 Yeah.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.440
 OK, so there was the Master System and then the Mega Drive, the Genesis.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.880
 What was the Japanese version of the Genesis?

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.880
 Oh.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:58.880
 Was there one?

00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.880
 I think it had a different name.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.880
 Was that the Mega Drive?

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.880
 Yes.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.880
 That's when we're getting confused.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.880
 The Master System.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.480
 Master System was the US 8-bit Nintendo competitor.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:08.480
 Right.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.480
 Yeah.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.480
 Which like nobody had.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.960
 No, it didn't do well.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.960
 Yeah.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.960
 Was the Genesis.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:14.960
 Really?

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:15.960
 Yes.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.960
 It's the same thing.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.080
 I'm looking at the Sega Genesis Wikipedia page.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.040
 That's why-- sorry, I didn't not need to be a pedant about this.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.040
 No, dude.

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.040
 But--

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.040
 You're the expert.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.040
 Put me in my place.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.040
 I have to confess.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.040
 I was an Atari/Nintendo fanboy.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.400
 I never owned a Sega system until Saturn.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.520
 Oh, you picked a good place to pick it up.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.520
 I love my Saturn.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.040
 I love my Saturn, my dreamcast.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.040
 Saturn was nice.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:45.040
 But it short lived.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:50.040
 I faced it out quickly for a PlayStation 1.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.040
 That was probably one of the best.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:57.040
 My favorite game on Saturn was the Alien Trilogy game.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.040
 It's fucking amazing, dude.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.040
 That was one of the best console FPS that I ever played.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.040
 Like, Gold and I came out later and kind of stole the show.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.040
 But I feel like the Alien Trilogy game was way underrated ahead of its time.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.040
 Face huggers and shit.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.760
 Yeah, it was good.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.760
 But anyways--

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.760
 Yes.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:19.240
 --the Mega FM.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.720
 Very nice little box.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:25.800
 Kind of offers everything that I feel like the Digitone didn't offer me.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.280
 And that's mainly hands-on control.

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:39.000
 It's got 32 sliders, 14 knobs, 15 buttons, 6 voices, 4 operators per voice, 8 algorithms.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 7 mode arpeggiator engine, preset randomizer.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 Very nice.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 3 LFOs.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 Which is a little lacking.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 Oh, I said that.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 I don't know that.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 I mean, with all the shit they got on there already, it's a nice touch, I think.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 Yeah.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 Yeah.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.720
 A lot going on there on a little box.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.920
 And it's estimated to cost 525 USD.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.200
 That's a good price.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:11.400
 The Korg OP6 looked kind of cool, but it's so prototyped at this point.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.400
 Yeah.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.400
 There aren't many details.

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.040
 Missed that completely.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.640
 It looks like a DX7 kind of clone from Korg.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.200
 But it's like FM, but it's got a bunch of sliders on it too.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.200
 I remember looking at it for like a split second.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.200
 Yeah, because then I saw the Mega FM and I was like--

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.200
 Hello.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.200
 Yeah.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:38.060
 But I've always wanted a nobier DX7 and he hasn't, like, something that's a little more fun to

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.840
 program than one slider and a bunch of buttons.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.280
 But we'll see.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:48.200
 The DX200 have a lot of awesome stuff and a lot of improvements over it, but still also

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.200
 has a lot of faults.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.800
 Yeah, they could remake that.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.800
 I don't get like--

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:56.000
 Like, there's got to be something between the Volca FM and like a big-ass keyboard that's

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 like fucking huge.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.560
 Yeah, because they tried it with the re-face.

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.160
 There was a DX7 re-face that they did.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.160
 Yeah.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.160
 But you tried.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.160
 It's on Obcon.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.160
 Yeah, and you--

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.160
 You've walked away shaking your head.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.160
 I was like, no, no.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.400
 And the thing was I wasn't being like an asshole, but I was like, I want to like this.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.400
 I want to walk away with one.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.760
 I was like, no, I could not fucking get into it.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:18.720
 I thought it was a terrible-- like, they just did everything fucking wrong with it.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.280
 So yeah, they just were like, OK, DX200 fixed a couple of things that were wrong with

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.640
 it.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:30.120
 And then just the last bit that they didn't surface and just sell that, I think it would

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.120
 be huge.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.120
 Many people got to export.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.120
 Yeah.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.760
 With some interface that wasn't some fucking things you have to push with your thumb, it's

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.880
 like, am I masturbating the synth right now?

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.880
 That's touching its prostate.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.680
 You've got to make it come.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.880
 We were just describing the mega FM.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.480
 It's going to make you come.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:56.760
 Holy shit.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.920
 Hopefully that's what ends up on the box.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:05.000
 So wait, do you have any more good ink will, Tarkrag?

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.400
 Like something really good.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.400
 Like actually good.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.400
 That was it.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.360
 The only thing I could even talk about is the dark matter.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:16.480
 And I've only put like an hour into it right now or two, which I fucking like it a lot.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.480
 That would say mayor.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.480
 Yeah.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:23.120
 Okay, that was something I wanted to say recently got a dark matter and you got a dark matter

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.120
 as well.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.120
 Yeah.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.120
 And I love it.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:30.880
 It's more than just a feedback machine, which we talked about like, and you've talked about

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:31.880
 this in the past.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.880
 A little bit.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.040
 It's the idea of you can create feedback without special modules.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.040
 I wouldn't need it.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:42.040
 If that's all it was doing, this model would be you wouldn't need it.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:47.440
 But all of the relationship between like the EQ and the feedback, like the amount that

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:52.960
 they're giving it, being able to send the feedback out to get processed and come back

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:58.160
 in and you know, CV over, even just the dry and like the feedback amount.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.640
 Yeah, that's huge.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.840
 It's fucking amazing.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.440
 So my question is Greg, I know you had a dark matter for a while.

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.440
 Yes.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.440
 What were you not stoked on?

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.440
 Yeah, it's been burning me too.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.600
 I'm like, what the fuck did he not like?

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.160
 It wasn't a matter of not liking it.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.160
 It just felt redundant.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.360
 It was when I was trying to downsize everything.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.360
 Yeah.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:20.480
 Pretty much just using it for feedback routing, which I can already do with some of the mixers

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.080
 that I got.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:29.120
 And the distortion was cool and the EQ functions, but I also had that already too at the time.

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:33.720
 Like I was using, I had multiple playeresses that I was routing feedback through, bandpass

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.520
 filters to control like the frequencies of it.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:45.120
 I also had the surge resonant EQ, which I was using a lot for feedback processing.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.080
 So I just felt like I had too much going on to do that.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:56.200
 And it wasn't like the cheapest module and it was reselling for pretty much what it

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.200
 cost new.

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.560
 So I figured I should just flip it and not look back.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:05.920
 But now that I'm going for like an even more compact setup and hearing you guys talk about

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:11.840
 it again, I'm kind of eyeballing it again instead of using all of my filters and mixers

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:17.040
 to process the feedback would be nice to have all in one solution.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.760
 And then there was just the, I just kind of felt like cheating with it, you know what

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.760
 I mean?

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.760
 Like, I don't know.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.160
 I felt like I didn't want an all in one solution.

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.120
 I was like, oh, I'd rather come up with this super elaborate, overly complicated process

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.240
 to do it.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.400
 And now I'm looking the other way.

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.400
 I'm like, that's stupid.

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:37.200
 I don't need to dedicate all of these modules to do feedback.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:41.680
 So yeah, anything that's a shortcut is kind of like coming back in favor for me.

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.760
 So yeah, it wasn't that I wasn't stoked on it.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:47.360
 I had a lot of redundancy there and I felt it was an unneeded purchase.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.040
 So I tried to flip it quickly.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.560
 I was impressed with the amount of variety that has when I got it.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.920
 I was like, oh, this is going to do like two things and I'm expecting it to do it kind

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.920
 of well.

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.720
 But it's, I was surprised how far you could push things in the way.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:03.920
 Like we were saying like the different pieces kind of duck each other at points.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:08.240
 And like, I was just running like a eighth note or sixteenth note, high hat into it and

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.640
 turned it into very quickly into like, all right, these are some really good.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.240
 Full low gabber kicks.

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.240
 Yeah.

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.280
 And it was like, okay, you can really like sculpt the shit out of this.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.400
 And it's not just like a little bit of saturation that you can feed back.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:25.280
 It's more like you can really take some shit to crazy territories and see being everything.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.080
 It's just like fuck.

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.280
 That's when it kind of hooked me.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:33.280
 Yeah, because even like when I first got it, like I knew running gabber kicks through it.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.880
 Was I mean, essential?

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.880
 Yeah, I mean, that's that's my question.

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.520
 But I even was like, like what would it happen if I just did like a simple sign?

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:46.320
 Like what could I do with this with the simple sign oscillator and within 10 minutes?

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.960
 It was mutated and all over the place.

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.880
 And now this is a completely different signal.

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.440
 It's become it's gone from like the most boring signal you can possibly get to something that's

00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:00.680
 going nuts and then I unplug that and then put in something from the graphic VCO and

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.680
 then something from Le Kelleck.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680
 Yeah.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680
 Like I just started jamming all the different stuff.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.960
 I'm like, everything just took on these new life.

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.600
 So it was like, it just basically doubled air.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.040
 I felt like it was doubling everything.

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:14.600
 Like here's everything without dark matter and now here's everything with dark matter.

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.960
 That's funny you say that because I took, I was doing some drama work and I was like,

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.960
 cool, that's crazy.

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.080
 And then I was like, oh, just taking out from the voltage lab from the Pittsburgh voltage

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.080
 I haven't put it in there.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.840
 And it was like, holy fuck.

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:29.440
 First off, the complex oscillator and the feedback stuff was like interacting really well.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.560
 And it was almost like, huh, I kind of just want one of these just to put at the end of

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.720
 this all the time.

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:38.440
 So it definitely sounds good on just like regular oscillator and synth tones, which I

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.160
 was impressed with kind of.

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.000
 I didn't know if it was just going to be like, oh, I'm just going to smash this kind of

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.400
 thing or what, but it's pretty damn varied.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.400
 Agreed.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.000
 You guys think you're going to get the waiver?

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 I don't know.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.360
 It's a new one that was just announced.

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.520
 Before I got the dark matter, I probably have been like, oh, that's interesting.

00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:00.200
 But blow it off is like another wave, folder, wave shaper thing.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:05.560
 But since it's Casper and Bastol who made the dark matter, my interest in everything they're

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.960
 doing now has gotten, gone through the roof.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:13.240
 The only thing about the waiver, I'm like a little, there's just not a lot of good information

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.240
 about it yet.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.240
 It's the only bummer.

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.840
 I'm like, I really want to get excited about it.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:21.760
 Now that I'm fired up for that combo, I just want, I wish there was more data on it.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.120
 One thing I noticed is it didn't have any like pin headers on the back of the waiver

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.200
 when I saw it because the dark matter's got a bunch of shit on the back where it's like,

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.960
 oh, it seems like it's built to interact with some expanders or something.

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:35.160
 And if they would have made a waiver that was built to hook up with that, just as like

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.880
 a behind the panel, you have feedback loop.

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:41.480
 Um, sand, that would have been kind of a no brainer almost.

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.240
 Oh, this is an expansion of that with wave folding.

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.240
 Sweet.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.240
 Yeah.

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.760
 I just know that wave shaping feedback is good stuff.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.360
 I think the two would go together like fucking peas and carrots.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:59.320
 I, uh, I've remembered that I had my micro fold and immediately was like, oh shit, you're

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.320
 now interesting again.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.320
 Right.

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.040
 So imagine this.

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:08.720
 Your patches that you're already very excited with that you're developing with dark matter,

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:12.920
 like you're saying on the complex, osk, imagining getting that together and then routing the

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:16.680
 feedback out of dark matter through waiver and then back in.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.680
 Yeah.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.400
 And now you're mutating the mutated feedback.

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.040
 You know what I mean?

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.040
 Yeah.

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.040
 I think the two would be a good pair.

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.240
 It does seem odd that they didn't make it an expansion, you know what I mean?

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.240
 Yeah.

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.400
 But maybe they thought it just, it stands on its own two feet too, I guess.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.400
 I don't know.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.400
 I got cables.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.400
 Yeah.

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.400
 Yeah.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.480
 I mean, like, but that would have made it all the more enticing to just have that fucking

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.320
 everything just connected in the back.

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:43.560
 But like you said too, like, um, immediately it was looking into the cast for dude.

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.760
 I'm like, Oh, I haven't researched this guy.

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.120
 I know about Bastol a little.

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:50.000
 And the more I saw like his live set shit and what he does and like this, he's kind of

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.280
 more like us and then he's like doing like just few pieces of hardware on a desktop all

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.280
 fucked up and gabbery.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.760
 And I was like, okay, cool.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.920
 Like you're on the level.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:01.080
 Obviously your design is like, yeah, you want this thing because I'm sure you use the

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.080
 fuck out of it.

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.280
 You know, it's not just like something that you hate for vanity.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.000
 Yeah, he didn't create it just to try and sell something.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.840
 He created it because it was something he needed.

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:11.840
 You know what I mean?

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:15.200
 Like he wanted, like we were just saying he wanted to shortcut the process so you don't

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:18.120
 have to dedicate half your rack to feedback processing.

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:21.880
 You can have an all one solution and something he wanted for performing.

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:26.680
 You know, he basically built it for himself and then he wanted to perfect it before selling

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:27.680
 it.

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:30.760
 Like it took him, I think a year of like perfecting the prototypes to it was at the point that

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.640
 he was comfortable with selling it.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.640
 Yeah.

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:37.640
 And like hearing him talk about saturation and feedback, I'm like, this dude fucking gets

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:38.640
 it.

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.640
 You know what I mean?

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:43.520
 Like there's a lot of people out there I think who make saturation and stuff who don't

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.520
 get it.

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.280
 They're just, you know, I don't know.

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.240
 There's a question I have for both you.

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.800
 What distortions do you think sounds similar to that?

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:54.680
 Because I got that module and I was like, holy shit, this is like kind of a distortion

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.440
 sound I've been going for for a while, whatever it was.

00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.440
 Trashmaster.

00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.440
 Trashmaster.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.440
 Very similar to the op amp and that.

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:07.160
 Especially with the filter because you can get like, you know, you can route the filter

00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.600
 and trashmaster like through that distortion unit.

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.000
 So then you got like a squelchy band pass filter kind of going through it.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.040
 So it's like a narrow bandwidth type of thing that you're hitting that op amp with and then

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.040
 saturating it.

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.600
 So you're not blowing it out full frequency.

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:21.600
 Right.

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:22.600
 Fine to me.

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.600
 Yeah.

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:24.600
 Trashmaster reminded me of it a lot.

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.080
 And they're stereo to your right trashmaster?

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.080
 No.

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.080
 No.

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.080
 No.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.060
 So if you're not using it, you've got your filter in and out and then your saturation in

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:37.280
 and out and they're normal so you can go in filter out saturation or in saturation out

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:40.180
 filter or have what I like to do.

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.180
 Cool.

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:42.180
 Yeah.

00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:45.560
 Or like another reason why I sold the darkmaster using trashmaster a lot in feedback processing

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:51.720
 too because you can have like clean filter out going into other things for feedback modulation

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:55.360
 or routing and then you have your saturated signal going out.

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.360
 You know what I mean?

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:59.840
 I've got a lot of stuff that was kind of covering that territory.

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.720
 But I also had multiple trashmasters back then.

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:07.760
 I only have one currently so I have downsides a little bit and now I can't really just dedicate

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.920
 my trashmaster to feedback if I, you know what I mean?

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.920
 Yeah.

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.880
 I couldn't answer that question because I don't think anything sounds like it because of

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:20.920
 me thinking like the stracker doesn't have that, the gristle stuff doesn't have.

00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:27.160
 Even the old like spectral divisator that I had just this is a unique sound like I'm

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.920
 not, I'm not going to get out of anything else.

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.160
 It's a very warm, grimy sound.

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.160
 Yeah.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.160
 Yeah.

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.400
 That's the shit I try to get out of other stuff.

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:38.480
 And I think like the in-wall heat gets kind of close to that but a little different.

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:45.000
 A lot of the other stuff I have has like an icier tone which I love but then I think that's

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.160
 another reason why I'm excited about this is not replicating anything that I have.

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:53.040
 This is a pretty unique sound I'm getting out of it which I'm stoked on.

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.040
 It's kind of like a-

00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.040
 It's kind of like a-

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.040
 It's a little bit too thumbs up.

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.040
 Yeah.

00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:02.640
 I don't know what amps are in dark matter but it sounds very much like a tube screamer

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.120
 type of circuit.

00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.120
 Agree.

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.120
 Yeah.

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.120
 I have more stuff.

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.480
 Yeah, I have a few bad things.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:10.120
 I have a couple of bad things too.

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.440
 I'm gonna go with the next bad thing.

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:16.120
 I'm curious if we have some sort of the same thing.

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.560
 I bet there's a little bit of overlap.

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:21.680
 My first bad one is Dope for has a new product.

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.680
 Yeah.

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.880
 I have that under ugly not bad actually.

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.120
 Oh I have it under bad.

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.680
 Did you see him, Deeter using it?

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.680
 I did.

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:30.680
 It's like a ball thing.

00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:35.200
 It's a 10 minute fucking video of him explaining the joystick.

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.000
 It's a joystick but it also twists so there's another dimension to it and then there's a

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.600
 button at the top.

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.800
 And you just summed it up in 10 seconds instead of 10 minutes.

00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.280
 Someone wants that?

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.640
 Apparently Deeter thinks that they do.

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.720
 It is him trying to press the button.

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:56.080
 I think that's what like a lot of the video is him just trying to use it.

00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.200
 It looked completely impractical as a joystick for the button.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.480
 The twisting didn't really make sense.

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:10.080
 It's just basically like a pot on top of a joystick and then just a much bigger like

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:15.800
 the biggest HP joystick in the world because it looks like an old like flight simulator

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800
 joystick.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.800
 It is a substantial construction.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.840
 It looks like a giant dildo sticking out of a modular panel.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.840
 Yeah.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.560
 It's bulbous and phallic.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.680
 I wrote in my notes here at the time that I was watching it.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.920
 I'll be a monkey's uncle if it's not the ugliest thing I've ever seen sticking out of

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.880
 a modular rack like some bulbous biomechanical dildo.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.040
 Arousingly phallic.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.040
 Oh my god.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.920
 Yeah it's bad looking.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.920
 Yeah.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.440
 What the fuck was he thinking?

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.440
 This is ridiculous.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:51.840
 It's ridiculous and he tried to talk about it for 10 minutes and I fell asleep.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.360
 The fact that he was having trouble.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.280
 He's fumbling with the button.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.280
 Yes.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.440
 Because you don't even realize there's a button on the top when it starts out because he's

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.440
 really excited about the twist.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.320
 He's like this is another dimension and then it's like halfway through.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.600
 He's like oh and there's a button at the top.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.040
 Every aspect of it was impractical.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.920
 This looks like the most awkward thing.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920
 Yeah.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:20.000
 I find Dieter's interviews charming and amusing but this is a big hard mess.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.760
 This video could cure my insomnia and get me aroused at the same time.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.120
 It's like putting a gate on top of a D-pad.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.120
 Yeah.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.320
 Like why would you just put it next to it?

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:37.160
 In the video he's using the button to trigger an envelope and then he's using the twist to

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.000
 lengthen the envelope and he does that for 10 minutes.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.040
 I'm glad you brought it up because I almost forgot about it already.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.880
 I just wanted to block it from memory.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.840
 It'll haunt your dreams.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.840
 What else you got there?

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.560
 So I also have and this is in comparison to what we were talking about earlier.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.000
 The Frappe tools Benzo.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.440
 Don't have that one on there.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.280
 So it is a massive, massive oscillator.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.880
 Like I remember seeing it was gigantic in circular in design.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.520
 Yeah, there's like a million noms, a million jacks.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:18.160
 My notes are and I watch two different videos on it because I was like, oh this first video

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.400
 I just thought they fucked it up.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.880
 I'm like, okay they just didn't know what they were doing or they just got there.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.560
 Like whoever's doing this presentation just didn't get it.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.880
 This is much later and it's a different presentation.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:36.680
 My note, this is a lot of jacks and knobs for what is a thin limp oscillator sound.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.160
 Like I could not believe that much machination went into making this sound.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.640
 Honestly it seems like a joke.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.560
 And they were Ernst Weilbacht and there's a lot of explanation.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:50.400
 There's a lot of words to describe what went into it and none of it seems reflected in

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.400
 the sound.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:56.480
 Because it's not like the Rossoma simulator which is another big giant.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.240
 And like he's got like his presentation from, I forget what it was like maybe super booth.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.680
 Like he's got PowerPoint presentations, all this like explanation for what it does and

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.200
 it produces a really interesting sound.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.840
 It's not something I'm fired up for and not going to get.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:15.440
 But there was a mapping of like you had an idea and it's a crazy idea, a lot of math,

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.320
 a lot of engineering and then you created something that has all this.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:25.800
 This Benzo was like math and ideas and a lot of talking and just this weak ejaculation

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:26.960
 at the end of it.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.600
 I was, yeah, I was.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.400
 I kind of feel that way about all the frappetool stuff.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.400
 It's like all panel.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.040
 Yeah, then I'm like, but it looks like a healthy use.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.040
 Yeah.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.000
 I'm not a big fan of circular designs anyways.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.040
 I think the only thing that I ever jived with was the future retro revolution.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.040
 Yeah.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.040
 Yeah.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.440
 It was okay for being a circle.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.080
 Even that bothered me then.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.040
 I was like, I don't feel like I'm working a clock.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.040
 You know what I mean?

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.400
 He's going fucking round and round.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.920
 Like there's so many more interesting symmetrical designs you could do for a panel layout than

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.920
 a fucking circle.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.880
 It's like the most basic shape.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.880
 Yeah.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.960
 I feel like I never had one, but I always felt like, man, my cats would be really into

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:09.960
 that.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.400
 Like they would just like chase it and go, there we go.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.400
 It's going around.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.040
 It's going back.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.360
 I did have, I'm sorry, I actually had one more thing.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.360
 Sorry.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:22.760
 I'm hoping it's the one that's at the top of my bad list.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.600
 Well, this is the last one I have.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.840
 So we'll see if that's the case.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.160
 The Pittsburgh modular Forex delay line module.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.160
 Nope.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.160
 I did not look at that.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.160
 Actually.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.160
 So it's a cool idea.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:41.520
 So the idea is that it is a karaoke delay chip and it's an array of them.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:47.040
 And the idea was, as they were designed, they realized the other BBD chips with each one

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.200
 that was adding noise.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:54.400
 And so by the time they had four of them in a row or even within like a matrix, the noise

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.480
 was just through the roof.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:01.000
 So they figured out that these karaoke delay line delay chips had, did not have this noise

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
 problem.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.320
 And so they came up with this big, big giant array.

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.640
 And there's different ways that you can, they interrelate.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.960
 You can have them in serial.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:13.560
 You can have these sort of like feedback things and there's a little patch thing at the end

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:17.200
 for breaking some of these normalizations.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.400
 External signal, blah, blah.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.320
 Sounds cool.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.320
 It was not.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.960
 No, no, it was really like.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.960
 It's big too.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:30.600
 And it's actually never used the delay that's on the voltage lab.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.600
 Like ever.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600
 Is it the same one?

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600
 Or like so?

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.600
 Yeah.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.600
 Yeah.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.600
 I was super impressed.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.600
 Yeah.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.600
 How much HP we talking?

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.600
 It's fucking big.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.600
 Like have a row maybe.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.600
 Or 40 HP.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.600
 Yeah, it's very large.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.640
 Yeah, first I saw it was like, oh, it's kind of like trying to be a much, much more basic

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.640
 rainmaker.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.320
 Yeah, but not quite.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:56.360
 You saw they went all, they're going, they're on the black panel wave now too.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.360
 Oh really?

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:04.080
 They're old standalone module voice thing and it's like a black panel and it looks better.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.080
 But you know.

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.960
 Now I'm officially also going to do another one.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960
 I had a couple.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.960
 Oh, okay.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.960
 First and foremost.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:14.600
 I can't even say this one without laughing.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.600
 Okay.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.240
 Watching the videos of it and seeing the pictures of it.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:23.120
 I just kept cracking up every time because I'm just like, who asked for this?

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:29.040
 It is the Leek Home DM 48 digital midi harmonica.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.040
 What?

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.040
 Oh, I slept on this.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:34.040
 Yeah, I didn't see this one at all either.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:34.960
 So go and don't let the other one.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:43.400
 Have you ever wanted to assign notes to slices of a breakbeat and chop up an amen break, Dave,

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.560
 with the power of your voice?

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.560
 Well.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.560
 Now you can.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.080
 I didn't know that I wanted to, but now that I know that it's possible, I want nothing

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.080
 else.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.080
 Yep.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:07:00.280
 You can practice your harmonica playing in silence now, Dave.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.840
 Because why would I want that?

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:04.840
 I don't know.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.000
 It's a midi controller that you.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.200
 It's an ugly ass black box.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.080
 Does it look like an amenica?

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.760
 Like does it have the flow of the mouth?

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:13.760
 Not really.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.080
 No, it looks like a UFO.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.800
 But you can assign each note individually.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:27.080
 So if you're not running a harmonica emulation, you could also control other plugins with

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:35.440
 this, control note data with your mouth, which isn't new exactly, but now you can do

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.680
 it in the format of a harmonica.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.240
 They should actually, they should ban that company from being able to use plastic.

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.920
 They should be like, you know, you're just wasting resources.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.480
 They lost their plastic.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.480
 We did license.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.920
 If you wanted to practice harmonica and not annoy everyone around you, now you can just

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.640
 annoy yourself in silence.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.640
 I'm still like really stuck on the image of someone ripping like an amenic break through

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.640
 one of this.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.840
 That's what full fucking like rocket jungle style was.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.880
 I wished a video demonstrated something like that.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.800
 Like that is just what my own brain developed.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.800
 Yeah.

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.860
 I'm just thinking of a cool use for this fucking thing.

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.160
 And I was like, well, you can probably chop a break with it.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:18.640
 And I was like, why am I thinking that?

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.440
 But yeah, so that was at the top of my list of just bad.

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:28.840
 And then there was another one that I was also just seemed like a fucking joke.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:38.680
 The Casio Tone CTS 200 S 300 and S 250.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.240
 I can't even describe you how bad this thing is.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.520
 It's so ugly, so huge.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.800
 Like just Google it and see for yourself.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:53.160
 Because I had like a Casio Tone CTS something and it's super tiny, dude.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.160
 This ain't tiny.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:09:01.120
 And the video spends more time talking about the giant handle that is built into it as

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.400
 a selling point than anything else.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.600
 The dude, the sales guy, first he hangs it on the wall and goes, look, you can hang

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600
 it anywhere.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.840
 And I'm like, why would you be hanging your synth up?

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:11.840
 I don't know.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.840
 Okay.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:18.480
 And then he's playing it and he goes, now you don't have to play horizontal anymore.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.960
 You could play vertical and he takes the giant handle and he lifts it above his head and

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.960
 he goes like this.

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.800
 And I'm like, that's what a key target is for.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.440
 And that's a little more ergonomic than this giant handle in the middle of it.

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.600
 But yeah, I don't know.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.360
 Every video of this thing was a joke and I had to watch it.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.640
 Yeah, it's really as hell.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.640
 It's gigantic.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.040
 It looks like a toy.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.280
 It looks like it's, that's for the base model.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:49.960
 You can get other ones with a little more features like features such as a pitch bend

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.960
 wheel.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.960
 Great.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.240
 That's a good feature.

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.240
 Not all models have it.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:00.360
 You have to get, I think, the 250 to upgrade to the pitch bend wheel.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:05.040
 But they all feature dance music mode.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.560
 Oh, yes.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:13.680
 The sales guy said, this lets you easily create and remix E-D-M tracks, Dave.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.560
 The power of rave brought to you by Cassiote.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:17.960
 What does the E stand for?

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.960
 Is that electronic?

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.000
 What's the D stand for?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
 I don't know.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
 I'm not from like...

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
 The central dick moves.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
 They're pushing the envelope here, Dave.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.080
 In quotes, this was the sales pitch in every video.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.280
 You can make music anytime, anywhere.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:44.000
 So if this was late 80s, early 90s, this would be advertised by a dude on a skateboard holding

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.960
 this by the handle going to the beach.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:53.600
 There's a little beach party going on, a little bonfire, and there's no music.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.360
 And then he shows up and he's carrying this on his skateboard, maybe turns it into a bike.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.840
 Maybe a surfboard at this point.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.080
 It has built-in speakers too.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:06.880
 Totally got that late 80s boombox vibe, but it's the year 2020.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.920
 I love this oxymoron too.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.640
 Go anywhere portability with 61 full-size keys.

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.440
 That's not fucking portable.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.440
 Super portable.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.440
 61 full-size keys.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.440
 Nick.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.200
 Did you not see the handle, Nick?

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.840
 Look at this picture from perspective.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.120
 They're taking up the entire side of tables.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.120
 Oh yeah, with the handle.

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.120
 You can just pick it up.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.120
 Yeah.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.120
 I mean, how more portable can you get?

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.120
 It has a fucking handle.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.120
 It's a handle.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.120
 Is this him?

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.120
 Is that your boy?

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.760
 No, but that's the dude that was standing in the background of some of the videos and

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.800
 showing you how easy it is to hold.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:44.000
 You know, like the dudes who stand in front of banks and like spin the fucking signs?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.520
 He's doing that with one of these things back there and like making goofy faces and

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.920
 shit showing how portable it is.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.920
 While the sales guy with the douchey haircut and the fucking microphone center talking about

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.560
 how you're not limited to just horizontal playing anymore and blah blah blah.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.120
 If you're pulling like synth rep straws, that is the very shortest fucking straw you can

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.120
 get.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:10.640
 So I don't know what's going on in this video and I'm not playing it, but this woman is.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.760
 This young woman is astonished.

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:15.720
 This young woman is getting paid by a CIO.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.440
 She's astonished at the capabilities.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.240
 I can't believe it's $120 and I still fucking hate it this much.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.120
 And I also feel like this is somewhat predatory because it's going to be that thing where like

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.320
 someone's aunt or uncle goes into the guitar center like Jimmy said he wanted a mug.

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:33.320
 Exactly.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.320
 Oh well, you know.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.320
 Is this a mug?

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.000
 Oh, this is better than a mug lady.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.160
 You can take this anywhere.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.720
 You can make music anytime anywhere.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.880
 He can pick it up really.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.640
 He better than a mug.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.200
 You can't use that mug without an amp.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.200
 Does he has an amp?

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.200
 I don't know.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.200
 Let me ask.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.200
 Well, don't worry.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.320
 This has speakers built in.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.200
 He said he was a moke one.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.080
 He can make music anywhere anytime.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.160
 He's going to like this one.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.640
 Oh, the keys light up.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:09.120
 That's, that's, we all get him this harmonica too.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:24.120
 Yeah, let's do a quiz.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.120
 Fuck it.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.120
 I mean.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.120
 All right.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.440
 So this is now the quiz portion.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.440
 So okay.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:34.320
 The rules of this are going to be I'm going to provide you a comment that was provided

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:42.200
 in a YouTube video for something one of these, one of these presentations from the four

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.760
 mentioned convention.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.400
 And you're going to tell me what it's from.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.400
 Okay.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:51.960
 Now previously I'd given you a list, but I like the list for got to do that.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:57.280
 So this is, I'm going to rephrase this not as me being lazy and irresponsible.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:01.400
 I'm going to say this is just a more higher challenge.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.960
 So do we accept the terms of this?

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.200
 Yeah, I don't have a choice.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.200
 You really don't know.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.200
 That's what's happening.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.360
 I can try going to send it to the shit Dave.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.760
 Cross the threshold and yeah, what kind of Dave's hell.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.760
 Okay.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.760
 All right.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.760
 So here's the first one.

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.760
 Are you guys ready?

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:17.760
 I'm ready.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:18.760
 Yeah.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:19.760
 No, no, you don't look ready.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.760
 I'm talking at the bit.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.760
 All right.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.760
 All right.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.760
 All right.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.760
 Still dream of Casio, Tom.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.760
 All right.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.840
 Only a German would design such a thing.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.840
 I know this right off the bat.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:33.840
 I think.

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:39.960
 Peter Daufer's dick stick is 100% Dieter Daufer's.

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:47.120
 This is for the Daufer a 174, four, three dimensional joystick.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:50.040
 Beautiful bulbous biomechanical joystick.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.400
 Are you guys ready for the next one?

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.640
 Yes, sir.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.800
 I'm glad they added a power button.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.280
 Mm.

01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.480
 Since this is incredibly unfair.

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.080
 If you guys want clues.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.280
 I mean, one clue.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.280
 I think a lot of things have power buttons.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.080
 Do you want me to get a clue?

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:11.320
 This is an update of a previous product.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.680
 I think I know what it is.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:13.680
 Fuck.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.680
 Give me a minute though.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:15.680
 I'm clueless.

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.880
 We can take the lead on this one.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.880
 Deluge?

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.120
 No, but that's a good guess.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.880
 The deluge does have a power button.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:23.880
 Does it?

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:24.880
 Okay.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.120
 It just can be powered either through DC power or USB.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.120
 Gotcha.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.280
 I want one clue.

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.120
 Tell me the country of origin of the manufacturer.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.960
 I need to look this up because I want to make sure that I get it 100% correct.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:40.240
 It's got to be something that sucks because clearly people want to turn it off.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.240
 [laughter]

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.840
 Are you ready?

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.840
 Yeah.

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.480
 The company that makes this is French.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.480
 French.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:52.640
 I will give you one more clue.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:58.080
 The name of this product is something, something pro.

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.960
 Oh, uh, keystep pro.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.960
 Exactly.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.960
 Ding, ding, ding.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.960
 We will insert the ding, ding, ding.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:04.960
 Arturias French.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.960
 Yeah, they are frilly.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:06.960
 Yes.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.960
 I never knew that.

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.960
 Okay.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960
 That's why I had to look it up to make sure that that was correct.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.960
 Gotcha.

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.720
 I always think UK for some reason, but I think they're French.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.720
 Okay.

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.720
 On to the next one.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.720
 Are you guys ready?

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.720
 Yeah, I'm ready.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.680
 Perfect for space movies.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.320
 Christopher Nolan and James Cameroon.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.240
 I should buy them.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.240
 I'm not.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.640
 It is James Cameroon in the comment.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:28.640
 Corgue state.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.640
 That is exactly it.

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.640
 Ding, ding, ding.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.640
 Well played.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:34.240
 Are you guys ready for the next to last?

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.880
 The penultimate.

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.960
 This is just another money making scam to force people to use different connections.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.880
 MIDI 2.0?

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:50.120
 This is a video about MIDI 2.0 in which someone was exposing their conspiracy theory that

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.120
 someone is making money.

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.200
 Didn't someone do that last year too when it was first announced?

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.360
 People were saying this is all like a conspiracy theory.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.240
 There's a label that got some serious beef with MIDI.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.560
 Is it a different connection?

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:05.720
 I don't know because I didn't actually watch the video this time, but I imagine it would

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.720
 have to be.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.640
 I mean the architecture is so fucking old at this point.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.640
 Five pins.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.640
 I mean copper cartels.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:16.960
 You think that go with USB at this point, which every finger he has anyway.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.840
 Where's the conspiracy?

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.200
 So much audio shit is going to ethernet now.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.840
 Which ethernet is on that NPC one.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.600
 I still don't understand why.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.600
 It was on the force to.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.480
 And it wasn't really clear why.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.400
 To vague about how you can use it to connect your other shit.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.280
 Because all that audio shit now is on ethernet, that Dante spec.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:41.280
 You can apparently add super low latency and fucking super nice too.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.840
 I know I could share files to it too.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:44.840
 Over it.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:45.840
 Yeah.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.840
 Was it like addressable?

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.480
 Like a network drive?

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.480
 Yeah.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.320
 Alright, are you guys ready?

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.320
 Yes sir.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.320
 For the last question.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:56.360
 This was my favorite one.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.880
 I'll wait for the Bolin Jupiter B.

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:05.880
 Bolin Jupiter B.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:06.880
 Yes.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.320
 What's that for?

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.080
 Oh shit.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:14.440
 Oh I bet.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.040
 Is it the Udo Super 6?

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.040
 It is.

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:19.360
 Oh wait, great do you have a guess?

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.640
 No, I was thinking the same thing and I couldn't remember the name of it.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:22.880
 The thing that looked like a Jupiter.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.880
 Yeah, it is.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.840
 It's the Roland Jupiter X.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.440
 What the fuck is that?

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:28.920
 That's the...

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.000
 We played with the XM one.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
 It's like 15-year-old keyboard that...

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
 Oh shit.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.760
 Yeah, I forgot all about that thing.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.760
 Oh, it could be.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.760
 Yeah.

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.760
 I read that and I lost it.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:40.760
 Holy shit.

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.760
 I like it.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.360
 I wasn't keeping track.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.200
 Did someone win?

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.760
 I think we tied.

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.760
 Do we have a tiebreaker?

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:48.760
 Oh shit.

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.760
 I may have a tiebreaker.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.320
 Oh wait, I have another question.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320
 Sudden death round?

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320
 Sudden death round.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.320
 Okay.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.320
 I'll have another one.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.320
 Shoot.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320
 You guys ready?

01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.320
 Oh yeah.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.440
 Please make one with the old school color.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:06.080
 I'm going to say the Korg ARP 2600.

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.720
 Someone probably wants the blue panel.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.880
 That was a good guess but that is incorrect.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.880
 Damn.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.880
 Blue mani.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.880
 Yeah.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.880
 Ugh.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.240
 I will give you a clue.

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.360
 We did talk about this product.

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.360
 RD3?

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.000
 No, this was not a good tiebreaker then.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.840
 This was a comment from the Akai MPC1.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:26.840
 Oh.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.840
 Damn.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.600
 Alright, I do have one more then.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.320
 And this one is, this one's, this is scraping the bottom of the barrel now.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.920
 But we really cannot end on a tie.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.400
 Alright, you guys ready?

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.120
 Oh yeah.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.680
 Slough.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.000
 Slop.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
 Dave.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
 Slough.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
 Slop.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
 Dave.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.520
 Well, fuck.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.640
 Did we talk about this product?

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:54.120
 Did we not talk about this shit?

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:57.080
 We did not talk about this company tonight either.

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.720
 Pro 3.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.800
 Nick is the winner of our quiz.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.800
 Damn.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:02.800
 Congratulations.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.800
 Damn.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.120
 Yes, this was the video for the DSI Pro 3.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.120
 That wouldn't, yeah.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.120
 Wow.

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.120
 Congratulations.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.120
 I have no prize for you.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.120
 Yeah, Dave Smith.

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.120
 Okay.

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:13.120
 I see.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.120
 Yeah.

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.120
 That's the only thing I could latch onto there.

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.120
 Nicely done, Dave, without the Dave.

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.120
 I was grasping the fucking straws there.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.120
 I was like, oh no.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.120
 Yeah.

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:57.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.120
 I'm just a little bit of a slop.

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.560
 Holy shit!
