00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.260
 - I was gonna get better.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.060
 - Sisak Stumpden, poster number three, Robocop.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.920
 With gas Schondimantia.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920
 - And Robocop.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.900
 - And Robocop.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.080
 - Gas starting.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.400
 - A very realistic Robocop.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.060
 He's got some weight to'em dude feel.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.320
 He's all metal.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.800
 - Holy shit, that's way heavier though.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.900
 - Yeah totally dude.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.720
 That's substantial.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.980
 - This is couldn't he have more obvious weak points

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.240
 on his angles than that?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.060
 - Like literally you want to shoot.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.760
 - He literally can have been figuratively

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.840
 and it kills you.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.680
 - Yeah.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.440
 - Or just like rope him up around there.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.640
 - Robocop, you gotta step it up.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.680
 - Yeah I can take the, oh I forgot.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.520
 Fuck.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.600
 - There's a secret door.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.780
 - There's a lot of his legs.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.000
 - He can't run a little more.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.560
 - I was thinking I'm a weirdest.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.400
 - He's skiing too.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.320
 (laughing)

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.140
 - Boom.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.980
 - He's a little.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.640
 - Style, spare pistol in there.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.240
 - Or does he keep his condoms?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.480
 (laughing)

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.880
 - Playing with the video, Sam.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.380
 - The Greg Circuit and video mixer.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.660
 - Yeah can't you see it?

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.940
 - You guys can almost imagine what this looks like.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.860
 Yeah it's fucking hypnotic dude.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.020
 I'll patch that up while I'm passionate stuff.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.820
 Just start like malting things into it

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.580
 so that it's being like hit with the sounds.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.980
 - Have you played with any of the LVX?

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.820
 - Yeah.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.980
 - I have not.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.660
 One of my friends, her and I hang out

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.020
 and I make music and she brings over

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.060
 a modular video stuff and it's fucking amazing.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.900
 - That's cool.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.740
 - Super cool.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.580
 I'm really a lot of fun to play

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.380
 'cause you can just get in-

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.740
 - In-between frequencies, video frequencies.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.440
 It's really beautiful.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.540
 And I have a projector in my room

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.700
 so I just protect it all over the giant wall.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.540
 It's fucking wow.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.940
 It's amazing to watch.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.300
 - I do not have any of that stuff.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.380
 Yeah this is my first entry into video synthesis.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.400
 I just got the Ming mecha system

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.140
 and a circa bent Panasonic mixer from BPMC

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.220
 that I just run it into.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.540
 - Very distracted.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.840
 - Yeah like I said, it'll just pull you in man.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.680
 It's hypnotic.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.140
 - It's like a mirror of my brain activity right.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.700
 (laughing)

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.420
 - Is it the Klingon symbol?

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.060
 - I don't know if anyone else has anything.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.140
 - That's the sprite doing something.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.900
 - That show last night was fun.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.860
 - You should just mention that would be,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.540
 it would be wrong to not mention the show.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.900
 - Yeah I think, yeah.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.140
 - I think Dave should mention it.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.980
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.340
 - I don't want to, it was your baby.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.380
 - It seemed to go well.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.220
 That was dark tonic.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.020
 (laughing)

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.100
 - That's what I want to say.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.260
 - Close that chapter.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.100
 - All right.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.260
 (laughing)

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.180
 - Moving on.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.500
 - Moving on.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.740
 - It's always cool to see people who have seen play

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.460
 for 10 years continually push it.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.740
 It's, you know, a lot of people do not continually

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.020
 push what they do.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.860
 - That's awesome.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.620
 To see Pete get crazy for a second.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.460
 - Mm hmm.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.980
 - Throw up the BCR out and play it's at 280 BPM.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.980
 Crazy shit.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.460
 - I wish he did more of that.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.820
 Like I could've listened to that for another hour at least.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.980
 - Yeah.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.220
 - So let's talk about good things this year.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.380
 Only fucking good things.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.860
 Or shitty modules.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.900
 Nothing else.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.980
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.660
 - I mean, we'll get to the sheet, yeah.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.140
 Say let's do the positive stuff.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.980
 - Positive?

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.820
 - Yeah.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.780
 We're on a positive note talking about the show.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.620
 - Fair enough.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.340
 - A lot of us I think are using new shit in the show.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.060
 Like I was playing for the show.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.140
 I managed to work in the trash master.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.740
 The sink, a tur, itter.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.940
 I would have like pronounced it a powerful combination

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.780
 of noise and shit.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.180
 - How were you using it?

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.980
 - Basically just wanted it to be a noise box in my module.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.980
 You know what I mean?

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.980
 And it worked, I have the little light plane controller

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.460
 strip in there that I was using to control the pitch

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.420
 on the sink.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.140
 And then I was mainly tweaking the settings

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.420
 on the trash master.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.900
 And every once in a while, it mainly tweaked the like fold

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.500
 and the morph on the sink.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.660
 And it's a lot of tweakability.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.020
 - I got Dave questions too.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.540
 I wanna make you talk as much as possible.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.780
 - Oh, no.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.620
 All right.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.980
 I just wanted to know how you manage your patches live.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.060
 Do you do like little ones that I'm just curious

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.620
 like how people deal with that?

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.140
 I think I get a sense of how Greg deals with it a little.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.860
 But you get a lot of variety.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.620
 So I don't know if you have like little blocks

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.700
 that you play with or if it's like one.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.900
 - It's most of the little blocks.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.980
 And then I use the planer to sort of like,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.820
 that's the main thing.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.660
 - Oh, that's true.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.780
 - It's like going through the different things.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.220
 And so like I try to make stuff that works well.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.020
 If it's totally in, you know, just using just one

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.940
 of the four channels or blends well with other things.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.340
 And I don't really do too much.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.380
 Once I get the oscillator set and filter,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.020
 just fucking with filters and like cut off how much,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.620
 see like if I have CV going to it,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.340
 like how much CV they're not going into it,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.980
 especially on the wasp.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.620
 If I crank that up, that's what we need to do.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.820
 Like really like tweaky sort of sounds

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.660
 that I'm looking for.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.540
 - All your beats were RM1X.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.180
 - Ideas one and then RM1X.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.020
 - Okay.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.540
 - A vampire should never touch anything on that shelf.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.340
 - It's like a lot of, a lot of courts.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.460
 - I didn't see in courts, I'm seeing gemstones.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.660
 - I bet if you swallowed it,

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.780
 you would gain an ability until it exited.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.260
 (laughing)

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.500
 - I would become immortal, I'm pretty sure.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.100
 It's like temporary and mortality.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.420
 - Yeah, we're just not, we're just kind of

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.380
 what we have, already have.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.940
 - I forget what the first thing was.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.220
 - Yeah, it was deep.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.060
 It was a deep cut.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.540
 - It was as deep as we're getting.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.380
 - What do we do?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.220
 We have questions for Sean.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.980
 (buzzing)

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.060
 - We should grill him about something.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.900
 - Not about music, right?

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.260
 - I would ask, are you sequencing your modular

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.100
 with RM1X?

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.940
 - Yes, yeah.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.500
 - Do you have any delay on that thing

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.860
 to go into all that stuff?

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.380
 - I think that's the second one,

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.460
 the best things with RM1X is like that.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.460
 - I do, but.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.940
 - I was wondering how that would affect the modular

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.860
 workflow with it.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.740
 - It doesn't work as well as I want.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.660
 It may just be the limitation of the mid-to-the-cV

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.620
 that I've actually been looking into something

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.460
 that would handle a little bit more gracefully

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.660
 or do something cool with it.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.380
 Or it may just be the way that I'm using it.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.420
 - The R in this maybe.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.260
 - Yeah, I think that would open that combination

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.700
 and that would be a great bridge between the two

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.420
 because it is, that's the best thing about the RM1X

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.180
 and if you can't use it to its full capability,

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.220
 I'm not gonna get as much out of it.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.420
 - It's like another thing why I don't see

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.540
 about a lot of other devices

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.740
 that just don't have mid-to-lays built-in.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.580
 - The mid-box is the only other one that I know of, I think.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.300
 And you can even like pitch the delay, like the mid-to,

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.060
 like over time, which creates like all these arpeggiated

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.460
 like sea ones and it's sweet.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.300
 - Wow, that sounds great.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.700
 - Yeah, yeah, I love that thing.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.420
 - Have you been using that and singing that up

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.380
 to the modular stuff?

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.220
 - Oh hell yeah.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.060
 - And it does it well?

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.900
 - Oh yeah.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.740
 - Oh okay.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.580
 - Yeah.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.620
 - What a mid-to-cv-out of a Kilpatrick, okay 1600.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.300
 - Yeah, those are sweet and you can get them for like,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.300
 they used to be like 400 bucks, but I got mine for like 200.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.140
 - Oh wow.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.940
 - I can't get them used for not much

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.940
 'cause it's just their sexier, mid-to-cv-inter races,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.140
 but it's got like fucking two CV outs,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.940
 like four triggers and four gates or something.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:09.780
 - Oh, nice.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.620
 - It's like ridiculous.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.260
 - How do you actually set the channels?

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.100
 Is it just like,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.060
 - Oh, it's got learn, it's got learn, it's got learn.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.060
 - You switch it up like kind of nose type thing

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.300
 and there you go.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.140
 - Yeah.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.980
 - The one I have is just basically

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.980
 the first note it gets.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.340
 That's the channel it's going in.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.180
 - Are you doing live sequencing?

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.940
 Is that part of what you got going on

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.820
 with the Octatrack live?

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.900
 - I'm most of this pre-programmed.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.980
 I leave room to change things on the fly.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.820
 - I don't know.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.660
 - Yeah.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.980
 - I like to give a little bit of a live feel.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.380
 - Yeah, it's impossible.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.580
 - So I can entertain myself too.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.420
 - Up there.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.860
 - I mean, like you were doing a lot of changes on the rhythm.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.700
 - Yeah.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.780
 - With like the different pads and stuff.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.620
 - Yeah.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.460
 - Some of your playing.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.140
 - Popping things in and out really quickly.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.780
 - Do you load up like different projects

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.780
 when you're playing on the rhythm

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.900
 or you just keep one like project?

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.180
 - I have a lot of projects.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.100
 I mean, I have,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.780
 I mean, the Octatrack has 16 songs.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.700
 I just have to change up the rhythm

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.900
 like halfway through the set.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.740
 - Oh yeah.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.220
 - Or something like that because it only takes eight, I think.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.300
 - Yep.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.580
 - But yeah, I have 16 songs,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.500
 always at like my fingertips, which is kind of cool.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.140
 - Yeah, that's awesome.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.340
 - But I said things up, some things up,

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.020
 I have a lot of CC controls about stuff,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.140
 but then I leave a lot of stuff open

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.900
 so I can actually play live too.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.740
 - Right.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.660
 - 'Cause it's hard to have your hands.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.660
 Maybe we're at the same time.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.500
 - Yeah.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.340
 - Trying to get things though.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.500
 Automate some things that leave a lot of room for me

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.900
 to play with other stuff.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.300
 - Like we were saying about two drum machines,

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.940
 you know, using two live can be like kind of tricky

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.580
 if you've already got sequencer and synths,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.020
 you're kind of manage like creates a split,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.780
 you're not bringing it to kind of like to keep it to one

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.660
 of possible and then make some loops or something.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.580
 - I'm definitely going back and forth

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.700
 and I'm checking with Mulan,

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.660
 I'm just like switching my hands back and forth.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.500
 What not?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.540
 'Cause I set everything up so I can go in and out of

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.220
 so many different ways, some patterns,

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.380
 I'm between all that, so it can never be the same twice.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.620
 - And the virus, how is that, how are you working in that?

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.140
 Do you play that live at all?

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.220
 Like through the octave?

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.780
 - I mean, I record my patterns into there

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.300
 and then I just go into a lot of the settings

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.140
 and stuff like that.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.460
 - Yeah, that's a lot of different.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.820
 - The filters and FM stuff and they're the most

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.340
 and then some of the LFOs as well.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.660
 - Nice.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.740
 - Again, some things are pre-CC control

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.420
 and then I leave just like a few things,

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.180
 like pads or some other stuff I can manipulate as I go.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.620
 Nice, what not?

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.860
 Nadding effects as I go as well, so.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.140
 - It's kind of like what I try to do with the modular,

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.740
 I guess, like mostly, you know, for descent stuff

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.860
 and you know, noisy stuff, it's some processing.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.900
 Like I was gonna try to do like beat programming

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.900
 with the modular this time around.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.100
 Like you said, it was just too much.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.620
 - Yeah, I had too much going on.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.620
 Like I had that, I had the rhythm and I had the thras

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.060
 and I was like, this is just all over the fucking place.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.420
 I need to streamline this down a bit.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.300
 - How many dimensions can you dive into

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.780
 and still be sane at the same time?

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.060
 - Yeah, 'cause I figured I like,

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.220
 I really fucking love like jamming on the rhythm.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.340
 Like, you know what I mean?

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.540
 But like, I feel like when I do that,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.860
 the set just needs to be that.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.700
 - You know what I mean?

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.540
 - Yeah, that's all I do.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.380
 - I figured out like, now I have like two ways

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.020
 to perform live, I guess.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.860
 You know what I mean?

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.860
 One is like rhythm slash modular,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.860
 with the modular doing percussive shit with it.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.380
 Or modular doing synthy stuff and noise

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.460
 and the thras handling most of the beats, you know?

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.140
 It's like one or the other.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.940
 Like I couldn't figure out a way to do both and make it work.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.780
 - Yeah, it's a good segue way for you to play three shows

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.380
 in as many days with a thras.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.220
 How are you feeling it?

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.060
 - I like it.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.020
 You know, I had some buyers and more

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.860
 when I first got it

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.980
 'cause it just seemed like so simple of advice.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.980
 And an expensive device, you know?

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.540
 It was like all pretty and rainbow colors and shit.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.380
 And I was like, eh,

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.940
 it's probably not gonna work out for me.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.900
 I felt like it was gonna be too DJ-ish, you know what I mean?

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.580
 But I updated to the latest firmware.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.300
 That added a lot of shit that I really do.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.580
 Like that implemented the LFOs,

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.180
 shit ton more effects, master effects,

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.820
 more functionality with the MIDI,

00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:59.940
 just like a whole bunch of shit.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.660
 Like it still doesn't feel complete.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.820
 It's there enough, you know what I mean?

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.460
 Where I can use it live now and have fun with it.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.300
 I like it a lot.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.580
 Like I dumped all kinds of shit into there.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.180
 Loops from the modular, stuff from the rhythm.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.300
 Shunks from tracks that are on the record.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.580
 Like basically so I could remix that shit live,

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.980
 you know, which is what I was trying to do.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.660
 - Do you record into it or do you dump?

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.500
 - No, I just dump.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.260
 I put everything into a folder

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.460
 and then you can connect it right to the computer via USB.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.300
 It sees it as a drive.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.860
 You just toss all that shit in there.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.700
 - Oh, cool.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.740
 - Yeah, you can do it in seconds.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.100
 You're gonna do it with a USB stick.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.620
 You don't take it on the top of it.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.500
 Like you just.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.980
 - So it's simple like Dr. Track.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.820
 - Yeah.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.700
 - But the rhythm's a pain in the ass to get all the sounds out.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.540
 - Oh, dude.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.380
 - I try to get crazy.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.060
 - And you can't get them back out, electron.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.900
 - Yeah.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.460
 - But you cannot take them and they're like,

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.940
 oh, you better have all those samples.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.140
 And then like, you don't sloppy.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.780
 I just throw stuff like your sound.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.700
 I put it on the pad.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.700
 - Yeah.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.540
 One thing I also like about Dr. Track is if you got

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.340
 all these samples in there

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.020
 and then you realize you can put a little setting in there

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.260
 and have them get rid of all the samples

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.260
 you're not using enough.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.100
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.500
 - I wish I did the rhythm.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.340
 'Cause there's like,

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.460
 I can't remember every little sound I use everywhere.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.140
 And I'm sure there's a lot of them I don't use in.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.980
 - Yeah.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.980
 - I've gone through every pattern

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.940
 and looked at every sample being used.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.220
 And it took me like an hour and it made me mad.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.060
 - I don't wanna do that.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.900
 I like it.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.740
 - Dr. Track did it.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.340
 - Dr. Track just, just you click on that thing

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.620
 and it raises all the samples you're not using.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.700
 It's amazing.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.380
 - That is something computers and electronics are good at.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.580
 Making a human do it is pretty silly.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.420
 - Yeah.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.260
 - Yeah.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.100
 - I'm lazy.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.940
 - It's very good.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.740
 - I'm not doing that.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.140
 - Yeah, basically it puts it into drive mode.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.460
 Like there's an option in settings.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.660
 You hook it up the USB, enter drive mode

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.740
 and then computer just sees it.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.460
 You can take whatever you need off of it,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.580
 put whatever onto it.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.660
 You know what I mean?

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.140
 And then you just exit drive mode and it's just there.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.980
 You can browse.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.820
 It's just like battery.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.660
 You know what I mean?

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.940
 You select a track, you browse through your folder structure.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.140
 You put whatever audio file you want on whatever track.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.900
 And it's super, super quick.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.900
 - Can you tag stuff on there with like names?

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.740
 You'd be like, this is a pad.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.420
 You did it with color as I saw.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.260
 - Yeah.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.060
 - I was trying to organize shit with color.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.060
 No, you cannot add tags or anything just yet.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.660
 So whatever the file is named is what you get.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.300
 So like I came up with a little system

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:17.300
 like I put like BPM of the sound dash,

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.540
 like whatever song it's related to.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.620
 And then like dash one or dash two or whatever.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.260
 So I was doing shit like, you know, 146 dash pad one.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.300
 You know, just stupid shit like that through a reference.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.660
 'Cause you can see it on the screen, which is nice.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.140
 You know what I mean?

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.300
 That's one thing I really like about it

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.060
 is the big ass fucking screens.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.620
 - You actually organize things.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.460
 - I tried.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:38.300
 - I tried to help.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.780
 My shit's a fucking mess.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.700
 None of the words go with what the sample actually means.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.980
 Sounds like I just make up something like a (mumbles)

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.260
 and I just stop wave.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.460
 - Yeah, I get real OCD with that shit.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.140
 - I can't need to.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:51.980
 - Yeah, I can't do that.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.900
 - I need to do that.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.020
 - But I have like a few machines where you can like tag stuff

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.620
 and I almost never use it.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.380
 'Cause it's not like, I'm just gonna make it generally

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.780
 or like I know what I have.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.780
 I'm not gonna be like, oh pads, let me scroll through

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.660
 the, you know, congas or some shit.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.820
 - Well then you get to pad one, pad two.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.660
 - Yeah.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.820
 - So I had 23, pad 36.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.660
 It's like okay.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.500
 - Pad 36 is a good one though.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.700
 - It usually works out for me.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.100
 - Then you feel silly like trying to describe the pads.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:17.940
 - Yeah.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.660
 - And then it's just like squiggle ocean.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.940
 Like okay, this is not gonna make sense.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.060
 - And it's always what I move your in

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.460
 when you're already editing the sample,

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.700
 which doesn't make sense later on.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.420
 And you're like what the hell is I,

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.100
 you should like describe that.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.780
 - Yeah, as far as organizing shit on there goes,

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.580
 it's like you said I'm doing it all by color right now.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.980
 You can color the tracks, whatever you want.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.020
 And so I came up with a system to like colorize

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.260
 what I could combo into like tracks that would combo well,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.020
 tracks that are meant to loop and tracks

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.540
 that are just meant to be one shots.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.220
 But you can't color the scenes or the patterns yet.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.260
 Like it's just, it automatically assigns a color to it

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.420
 which is really fucking frustrating.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.100
 So like what I was doing was leaving empty patterns

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.420
 in between like the songs, you know.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.460
 And just so I had like a visual reference,

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.820
 but if they add that option to colorize that,

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.820
 that would be extremely helpful.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.100
 - I like that coloration option.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.300
 That'd be cool because I mean,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.020
 with Dr. Track could be something nice with something like that

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.900
 because I have different samples.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.340
 I would need a color on this one.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.980
 Like so I know what I'm actually pushing by

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.900
 because I have no idea.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.900
 I just wanna use so many sounds.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.500
 So I just have to wing it every time.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.460
 I would totally fuck that up.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.300
 - You know what I mean?

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.540
 Like I would be able to do it like I just,

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.140
 if I don't have visual references, I just lose my place.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:31.980
 - Yeah.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:32.820
 - So I do it often.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.740
 I just make them mistake twice.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.580
 Make them mistake twice.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.620
 - I made a couple mistakes last night.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.380
 - You don't have no idea what's going on.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.140
 I wish you had a delay on things.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:41.980
 - Yeah.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:42.820
 (laughing)

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.460
 - I love that accent.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.780
 - It has a similar button things like on the tier eight.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:47.620
 - Yeah.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.860
 - Which I was noticing too.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.020
 - They feel, yeah.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.220
 Like identical to the tier eight says bottom was,

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.540
 that brings me to a minor complaint actually.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.140
 Some of the ones on the end are a little,

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.980
 not too responsive and that kinda sucks.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.620
 - Are they meant to be played with world's buttons?

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.500
 - No, I mean, you hit on to change scenes

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.740
 and change patterns.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.420
 Which is how I play it.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.980
 I didn't use the Oranger mode at all

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.860
 'cause it's too limited in my opinion.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.860
 It was just kinda frustrating

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.980
 and you cannot set up pattern changing.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.140
 So you have to do it manually.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.460
 Which is what I was trying to do last night.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.580
 Like I was trying to be on beat,

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.860
 switching patterns manually,

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.780
 punching shit in and the buttons all the way on the left

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.620
 and all the way on the right.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.980
 Kind of like, I don't wanna say sticky,

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.940
 but like not that responsive, you know what I mean?

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.220
 That's kind of frustrating.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.060
 So I don't know if that's a design flaw

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.340
 or maybe I just need to break it in more or something.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.540
 But that was a little frustrating.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.380
 - Do you like a step edit,

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.940
 like all your patterns in there?

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:42.980
 Do you like tap 'em in?

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.700
 Or how do you like make stuff on there generally?

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.620
 - Right now I'm using it mainly like you would at Elton Live.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.460
 - Oh, okay, that's right.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.140
 - Yeah, loops and then I layer the loops, yeah.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.620
 So pretty much almost everything starts on the one

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.900
 or like the third, you know what I mean?

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.420
 Like, and then it loops for 64 steps or whatever.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.540
 Like what I was doing was dropping shit in there

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.540
 at the tempo it's meant to be disabling time stretching

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.980
 and then setting the tempo, the master tempo to half that.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.620
 - That way I can get more time out of it

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.420
 'cause there is some time restrictions on that thing.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.780
 Like you can't have more than like,

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.660
 I think it's a 30 second long sample

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.820
 or anything longer than your 64 step.

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:29.100
 So like to do longer stuff within a scene

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.420
 and like be able to transition

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.420
 and so have some things going in the background

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.300
 to the next pattern, I would like expand it like that.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.100
 - Robo-coffisturizing me.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.100
 - You're gonna give me a little fight eye.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.980
 - That's kind of what I'm hoping that the bit box

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.820
 will let me do.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.020
 - Play longer samples that I can have alongside stuff.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.180
 - Like bit box seems to have no restriction.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.860
 Like I was reading into it after you told me about it

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.380
 and like you can record up to four fucking hours on that.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.220
 - You have something?

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.260
 - It's like 24 or 48 or something.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.540
 - Yeah, that's insane.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.220
 Like I was looking at the functionality of it.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.580
 It seems a lot like the teraz and modular form, you know?

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.860
 And it's pretty fucking cool.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.660
 Yeah, I'm excited.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.500
 I'm excited for you.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.180
 I don't wanna see how it works, you know?

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.460
 But it looks like the same deal, man.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.300
 Like, you know, you tap a pad, you sign in a sample

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.820
 and you can play it with the screen or whatever.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.820
 You can trigger it.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.780
 - Can you have really long samples in that?

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:21.620
 Does it handle it?

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.980
 - Yeah, you're in the bit box yet.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.820
 - In the teraz and no.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.820
 - Teraz, teraz, okay.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.660
 So it's like Dr. Track a little bit too.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.060
 - Well, Dr. Track handles that shit better than this.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.260
 - I haven't actually dumped it really long.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.100
 Have you all done this?

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.180
 - Yeah, I don't just all these DJ years on songs.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.340
 I think I've never done that.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.380
 - I know people who did and like it just,

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.140
 I don't know if you change the BPM at all

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.500
 then you're time stretching everything

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.580
 and it's not that greatest time stretching.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.180
 Like it could be good, but I don't know

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.380
 if I want a full track coming through.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.660
 - I'm interested in just going to a problem with that.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.100
 I'm just doing some songs if everyone just DJ my songs.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.180
 - But yeah, if you were to keep like patterns with BPMs

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.500
 or something associated and there's like

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.180
 have your tracks the way you want,

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.340
 like I could see that working.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.820
 - Do you use it in the flex mode or the other mode?

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.660
 There's two modes.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.500
 - Oh, the static mode.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.340
 - The static mode.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.180
 - Yeah.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.020
 - The static mode, right?

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.300
 - Yeah, I'd usually use the flex mode.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.460
 - Well, I just sold it.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.300
 - Yeah, what is it?

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.900
 - I think the photostatic pulls right from the CF card.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.740
 - Yeah.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.500
 - Which is better for the longer samples.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.220
 - Yeah, and you can not like,

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.500
 if you do start point modulation on the static ones,

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.660
 it will not be able to catch up on the CF card.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.580
 But if you have it in memory,

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.140
 you can just go nuts and do like, you know, crazy,

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.900
 like if you're mancing a windowing.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.900
 - You want it instead.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.740
 - Yes.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.580
 - Gotcha.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.420
 - All right, flex.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.260
 - Or flex.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.100
 - The static will be the one where the CF card can't keep.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.620
 - Okay, okay, okay.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.100
 - I'm already gonna fucking buy one again, I know it.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:36.940
 - Don't do it.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:37.780
 - He's gonna do this.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.620
 He's gonna do this.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.540
 Just wait, they're kind of with the third one

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.580
 or second one, not third one.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.420
 - Yeah.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.260
 - You're gonna get to the second one before

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.260
 - Yeah, but I mean.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.940
 - They better come out with the second one.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.220
 - I can't even keep them in stock.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.140
 Like so many people use them.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.420
 Cool bolster those effects up a bit.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.660
 - Yeah, seriously.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.300
 - You can see a little more generous screen on that too.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.100
 You know, it works, it does the trick with that.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.580
 - That's that screen on the ice.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.700
 - Yeah, that was really nice.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.740
 - I don't see how's the touchscreen working out live.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.460
 - I mean, I didn't have any problems with it,

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.540
 but I'm trying to avoid touching it too much also.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.380
 - Oh.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.220
 - You know what I mean, like I wish I could kind of just

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.100
 turn that thing off.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.140
 Reason why I was touching it,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.620
 the only live performance was to get into

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.420
 different effects modes and to change the tempo.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.820
 'Cause there's no like tempo button

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.860
 to hit the tempo on the screen and adjust it

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.780
 with the jog wheel, which is kind of annoying.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.660
 - Looks like they're putting a looper in there or something.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.500
 - Yeah.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.620
 - Some more effects, but yeah.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.460
 - Yeah.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.700
 - Do you ever use that pickup machines in the Octa-Car?

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.420
 - I have not, I've never used it.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.540
 - There's a lot of things I never use on that.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.380
 - Yeah.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.380
 - What is it that's stuck on?

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.620
 - It's like a looper, like a true like almost guitar style

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.180
 like overdubbing looper thing.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.020
 - Oh, that's kind of the thing.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.900
 - You're just doing it with triggers and like reward stuff

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.740
 that way.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.980
 - We do much recording straight and live

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.900
 and adding it in as you're sequencing.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.620
 Ryan and I have been trying to do a lot of that stuff

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.300
 and it's been failing miserly.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.580
 - Yeah, the agency is nightmare of course.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.860
 - 'Cause we're sequencing like the modular stuff

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.900
 that we have to dunk back, like record it straight

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.820
 into the Octa track to sequence it right away

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.660
 has been a pain in the ass and it's just--

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.500
 - Oh.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.300
 - Recording live has been difficult for me

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.460
 and Ryan can't figure it out.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.300
 - Yeah, Ryan.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.860
 - I'm fucked.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.380
 So if you get me right off.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.660
 - We explained to the listeners here

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.820
 who you were referencing.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.060
 - Oh Ryan, it's an OctaCon.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.380
 - Shout out to the OctaCon.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.180
 - Yeah, sitting off the kinda college.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.700
 - Why is he not out here right now?

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.900
 - Yeah, the Octa track is just always too complex for me.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.220
 Like you said, if Ryan can't figure it out,

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.060
 then I have to go--

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.060
 - Just recording live.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.780
 - It's just the recording live.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.580
 - Yeah, I mean, I got the basics of it though

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.180
 and I had one but I felt like there was so much in there

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.420
 that I didn't understand or would use.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.140
 It was like, why the fuck do I own this thing?

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.980
 You know what I mean?

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:37.820
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.420
 - It took me like, when I moved over from the arm,

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.460
 our 7,000 normal next days,

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.100
 to the Octa track, it took me a really weird

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.260
 to figure out that damn super-

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.900
 - Oh yeah, it took totally different.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.820
 - And I was just angry and I just put it away

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.540
 until Matt Schultz split her eyes on one day.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.580
 He was like, no, here's what you do.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.780
 And then it all of a sudden worked for me.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.060
 - Yeah, it's all about the parts.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.820
 If you don't like, remember to save your parts

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.340
 and switch your parts 'cause it won't--

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.900
 - You just save the parts and then you save the patterns

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.620
 and then you save the project.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.740
 It's like, push the always button

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.700
 just to save the damn thing.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.860
 - Yeah dude.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.060
 - The rhythm is the same way it drives me fucking nuts.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.180
 I lost a lot of--

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.140
 - I gotta save the kit before you save the things.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.500
 - Like it's all f*cked up.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.340
 - Right.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.300
 - It's always nice to turn it back on the next day.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.140
 I wanna hear the--

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:18.980
 - Oh.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.820
 - It's all wrong.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.900
 - No, you have to, I have a total method.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.220
 I always do these over and over again, saving.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.060
 - It's one of those things, you know,

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.660
 it's almost the memory at that point.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.220
 - And I know that something like,

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.780
 people in the lecture are not supposed to be

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.020
 bitching about forever too.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.940
 Like, no, why can't we just have like a save all function

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.060
 in there, you know?

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.180
 - I know, I lost a lot of shit last time I was

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.020
 fucking around in the room,

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.940
 except for about to do that.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.980
 And I can't see where my kit and pattern buttons are now,

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.660
 because I tried to dust mine off,

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.620
 and apparently the paint on those panels

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.620
 are really shitty.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.780
 (laughing)

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.260
 'Cause I cleaned everything with a little bit

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.220
 of rubbing alcohol, dude.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.540
 Like cotton swab, rubbing alcohol.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.860
 I swear I cleaned all my--

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.700
 - Wait, on your rhythm?

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.540
 - Yeah.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.860
 - I was one of those sayings.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.500
 It was probably amazing to see you speak

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.900
 hanging play on the octa track.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.820
 Like I was trying to do an octa track,

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.220
 like I don't even notice.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.700
 - You do not track god, dude, Smith.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.540
 - Yeah.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.140
 - I want to see a show with him in basic play together.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:07.980
 - Oh yeah.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.220
 - You got a business show, oh, whoa.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.060
 - Oh yeah.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.380
 - Yeah, the alcohol just literally--

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.700
 - Like your makeup just got smeared.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:13.540
 - Yeah.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.860
 - Kind of rough night out.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.940
 - And according to the electron support,

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.380
 that shouldn't happen if you cleaned it with rubbing alcohol.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.860
 Like, well, it did happen.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.220
 - That's not actually a support.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.980
 Just telling you something shouldn't happen after it did.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.100
 - Have you updated this thing?

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.460
 - Oh yeah.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.620
 - Let's think that's so much crazy shit.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.620
 Now Ryan, I don't even do it,

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.580
 touch all the stuff Ryan does it when we do our montage stuff.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.900
 - Oh yeah, the end triggers.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.700
 - All the weird fucking stuff that shit.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.060
 - There's so many crazy things it does,

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.740
 and I'm just like, I can't remember all that.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.380
 - Yeah, that update,

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.380
 'cause you had told me that it was coming.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.860
 And that was one of the reasons

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.420
 that finally led me to buy the rhythm.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.660
 'Cause like my LXR had that shit,

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.380
 and I liked that a lot.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.420
 And everything in the rhythm was appealing to me,

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.180
 but the sequencer seemed like an immediate

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.660
 to be able to do that type of probabilistic shit.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.700
 And when you told me that it was probably coming down the line,

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.540
 I was like, fuck it.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.340
 I pulled the trigger and updated as soon as it came out, man.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.340
 - It's the shit, it's crazy.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.260
 - Yeah, it is.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.420
 - Again, like I don't even touch it,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.220
 'cause I'm trying to keep everything as simple

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.620
 or trying to over-complicate certain things.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.500
 And when it sets, 'cause it's hard

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.180
 when you're doing everything to remember,

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.620
 oh, this one goes in more of the submenu

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.980
 and pushing the other button to turn this with that.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.300
 I don't know, I can't fucking remember all that.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.860
 Things like fucking have all these notes.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.820
 I've been trying to get away from being confined by notes.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.820
 - This thing here, dude,

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.700
 it's essentially eight channels of rhythm style signals.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:28.780
 - That thing up there, the very gate?

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.620
 - Yeah, it's fun.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.700
 - I think it looks neat.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.420
 - Yeah, it's all probability sequencing.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.260
 You know what I mean?

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.260
 Just like with the rhythm,

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.140
 you can't do the trick conditions.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.980
 If this one triggers, this one doesn't type shit,

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.580
 but you got the probability, repeat,

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.500
 all this shit per step.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.700
 It's pretty nice and you get eight fucking channels of it.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.140
 - I've been staying away from getting a sequence

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.500
 from my mod set up.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.900
 I don't know why I've been stubborn about that,

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.700
 but just 'cause it's everything with the octetrap.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.740
 - Yeah, I do.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.380
 - But, pardon me, it wants it to be stamped a lot

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.420
 but I'm just gonna have to do some other stuff as well.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.780
 - I mean, even the yarn stuff, that doesn't have,

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.300
 I mean, it's called like a sequencer.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.140
 - Mm-hmm.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.940
 - I just started trying to learn that last week.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.740
 - Isn't it kind of, I had yarns for a minute,

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.220
 but I didn't use the sequencer,

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.900
 but wasn't it like kind of SH 101 style?

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.900
 - Yeah, I think it's like eight steps.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.940
 Yeah, I mean, I love my SH 101,

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.220
 I sequenced on that a lot, it's my favorite.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.140
 - I was when I had mine, yeah, I still got it.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:21.980
 - I fucking love that thing.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.180
 - Yeah, when I toured with my 606,

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.020
 I'm trying to learn that stuff.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.660
 Or another clock of the 606 has that out

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.300
 from the high tom or low tom, whatever.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.620
 Playing the sequences from the SH 101.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.540
 - You can kind of do that with the rhythm though,

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.820
 it has that, what is it, it's just called

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.100
 like the trigger machine or whatever.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.100
 - Oh, the impulse machine.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.020
 - Impulse machine, yeah.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.540
 So you can essentially send gates out of the outputs there

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.380
 and it'll trigger.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.460
 - That's why you were doing that, right?

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.300
 I thought you could post something

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.460
 about doing it that method.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.660
 - Yeah, I did do it for a minute

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.980
 and I was clocking with like the rim shot in there too.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.260
 Like I had a rim shot sample on one of the channels

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.980
 and those clogging, but ever since the latest update,

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.140
 like even if I take a channel out of the main mix

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.620
 and I'm trying to just use like, you know,

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.260
 the individual outs, if you know,

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.340
 they're like kind of paired the individual outs,

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.020
 if there's anything going on on that,

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.020
 that'll come out the individual out too.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.380
 - Oh yeah, that's the weird thing.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.380
 - That's the weird thing that'll flaw

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.860
 'cause it's like one analog voice.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.260
 So there are things where like,

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.660
 oh, this one thing will bleed it.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.500
 The cowbell used to bleed forever.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.980
 Like if you hit this pad,

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.100
 you would hit the fucking cowbell

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.060
 if you had a reaver bond.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.140
 'Cause it's re-robing that too.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.780
 - And I think they did fixate,

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.220
 but there's still some--

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.140
 - They're working it out.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.660
 - Like in a beta?

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.660
 Maybe or--

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.980
 - I think there's a fix now.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.820
 - I think it's fix now.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.500
 - So I think I was still having the issue last I tried

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.620
 and I just kind of gave up on individual outs

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.780
 for the moment to sequence and clock shift

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.980
 'cause it was just pissing me off.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.940
 - It'd be nice that this thing had more LFOs.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.940
 - Yeah, that is so--

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.700
 - Sounds like the right thing to get one.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.900
 - It's like, oh.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:54.740
 - Well even--

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.580
 - At least you could try--

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.020
 - Walk tracks LFO to another.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:57.860
 - Yeah, I'll track it through.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.700
 - It's awesome.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.700
 I love those fucking LFOs on that thing.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.660
 - Yeah and the designer for the LFOs,

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.940
 that thing's fun too.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.380
 - Yeah, the LFOs are if you had any unused LFOs

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.420
 on other channels, you could just assign them

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.260
 to a different channel.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.500
 So you could essentially have one channel

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.260
 with like eight LFOs.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.100
 - You know what I mean?

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.020
 - If you wanted, oh yeah, the LFOs are always awesome, man.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.140
 I love that thing.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.820
 - It was like, yeah, it was like a machine drum

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.900
 on fucking steroids, dude.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.020
 - It was still a machine drum.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.660
 - Did the trigger out stuff like way better.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.380
 'Cause it would let you set the gate length,

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.980
 which I don't think this does.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.620
 And it's like, that'd be cool,

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.420
 a bit of a cop is in fucking Star Wars, I don't know where.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.260
 - Fuck yes it would.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.020
 - 'Cause I don't know where, just popped in.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.100
 - Hey guys, why are your weapons old?

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.460
 - You know what, lasers now, right?

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.260
 (laughing)

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.220
 - This is like, my ice tank's gonna fuck up your laser zone.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.500
 - We have a star that will kill planets

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.860
 and you brought a pistol in here.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.100
 (laughing)

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.980
 - Have you seen that guy, your counter?

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.140
 - Roger.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.300
 - I'm gonna see that, I've never played WMDU.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.220
 - No, I'm sorry, no, not like the Guyger Counter module,

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.860
 but it's like built off of the--

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.700
 - Actual Guyger Counter.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.100
 - Wow, yeah, my friend has one of those.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.340
 - An actual Guyger Counter is fucking cool sounding too.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.340
 - Yeah, it like generates random events

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.220
 based on like, radio-

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.700
 - It's like one of those guysky, like crazy ones, right?

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.780
 - But it's similar to that, yes,

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.220
 it has like the big fucking rod on the front.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.540
 - Yeah, so like it's like kind of an impractical module.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.780
 - Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.820
 - Pretty gimmicky boutique.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:23.980
 - Yeah, that's what you're talking about.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:24.820
 - I guess it's just a game of games.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.820
 - I don't mean to keep it.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.340
 - Yeah, it's a whole game.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.660
 - Early warning system.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:29.500
 - It looked interesting.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.860
 - This is not part of the performance,

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.940
 we all have to leave.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.060
 - Yeah, you gotta go.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.300
 - Fusion too, they're making progress with Fusion,

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.140
 that's cool.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:36.980
 - Yeah.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:41.460
 - Go Fusion.

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.380
 - Yeah.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.060
 - What is it, fucking science type, Nick?

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.500
 - This is now Beekman's world.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.300
 - Oh, sequencing, I don't know,

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.860
 I like sequencing with the modular,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.420
 just 'cause I'm getting more into like,

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.420
 percussion in the modular, you know what I mean?

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.260
 I guess you could do that all with the octa track,

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.780
 but you wouldn't have the probability stuff.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.620
 - Especially the module,

00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.620
 'cause you don't even have to use it

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.020
 to like just trigger your percussion.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.340
 You can use probability gates to your envelopes

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.340
 or, you know, any reset shit.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.180
 - You know what I mean?

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.340
 - You can start getting really crazy,

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.220
 you polyrhythmic shit.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.100
 - There's probably ways around that too as well, right?

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.260
 So we'll do that type of stuff,

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.700
 we're using that still in there,

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.140
 you know, you're sequencing just the main pattern.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.580
 - If you point midi into it,

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.580
 you could do it in the octa track.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.540
 - You know, also there's this track length stuff

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.620
 which can get pretty intense and polyrhythmic.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.140
 When I got that, I was like,

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.740
 "Oh, I'll never be able to,

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.140
 "I don't have as many things to trigger."

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.580
 And his nose immediately, every output was used up

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:38.060
 because like resets on LFOs and envelopes, like all that shit.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.180
 - Yeah.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.020
 - It goes quick.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.220
 - I was using most of the channels live

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.460
 and I don't even have like any of your modules in there,

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.300
 you know what I mean?

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.060
 I was just using it to generate events

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.660
 and resets and goofy shit.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.420
 - Yeah, I feel like you should have at least one CV sequencer

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.420
 in there eventually.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.260
 - No, I'm not supposed to.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.540
 - Like I was going for sure.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.140
 - It does CV too, like it has two channels for note.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:58.980
 That's the other thing too,

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.940
 you can have those two CV channels like doing their own thing

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.700
 or you can tie them to one of the gate channels

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.340
 that are doing some crazy probabilistic shit

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.900
 or repeats or whatever.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.900
 - I said anything coming up,

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.700
 we could do like modular doing quad stuff, quad sound.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.540
 - Yeah.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.340
 - Outputs to help do with that yet.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.220
 That's what I'm working for

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.780
 is not the kind of like feature show we're going to do.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.500
 Like quad phasing, quad sets.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.180
 - So many of the quad mixer with CV I think.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.700
 - Well, there's a new key thing, Mel and mixer.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.220
 My friends worked on.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.060
 - Oh yeah?

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.500
 - Yeah, the new one, I haven't checked it out yet

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.820
 though, but I want to see what that's all about.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.980
 I have the Qneo and the QNexus I had about those.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.940
 But I think they just came out of the mixer from Brian.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.300
 It's part of kind of like he worked on that,

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.140
 engineered that.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:40.980
 - Nice.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.060
 - Yeah, that has possibilities,

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.780
 but yeah, I'd like to do more quad stuff,

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.620
 modular somehow.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.940
 - I do things from rotary knob to swirl things around

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.780
 or something like that.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.620
 That's what I've been looking for.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.180
 - The planner can kind of do that, yeah.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.020
 - Yeah.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.780
 - Like Boogla can, they have some quad stuff

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.220
 that's part of that system.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.660
 - Definitely some ureomol modules though.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.820
 - Yes, and they can do that.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.660
 - They're all right.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.300
 - I'm sure I remember there was an intelligible filter

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.260
 that could do that.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.100
 - They're really weird.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.220
 Like it would output CV.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.860
 - The Dr. Octo.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.700
 - Oh, okay.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.580
 - Oh yeah, does the quadrature shit.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.420
 - Yeah.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.460
 - Sample slicer.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.660
 - I like the fuck out of that.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.500
 - Oh yeah.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.340
 - Yeah.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.780
 - Sample slicer.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.340
 I dug that for minutes and I no longer have it,

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.180
 but I miss it.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.660
 - You think you're still gonna be using it

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.700
 once you get your bed box?

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.780
 - I think so.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.780
 - I think it'll be cool together.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.780
 - 'Cause it's got its own sound type thing.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.100
 It would be nice if they made like a CD quality one,

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.780
 but I like how you can window and it cross fades

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.540
 the little slices so you can scan through those.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.380
 - Absolutely.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.220
 - That's fun.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.100
 - What is the quality on it?

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.460
 - I wanna say like 12 bit, 22.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:47.300
 - Yeah, it's 12 bit.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.140
 - It's very cool.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.060
 - That's usable.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.420
 - Yeah, it sounds good enough.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.780
 As I was discussing with Morgan,

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.940
 it's really a lot better on like full frequency.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.820
 You like sort of sample external stuff in,

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.300
 but I think it just needs like a full sound.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.740
 If you just sample base into it,

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.700
 it'll be super aliased.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.540
 - Yeah.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.380
 - It's literally like anti aliasing.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.220
 - Right.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.060
 - Which you can use as an effective.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:08.900
 - Yeah.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.660
 - And they tell you like if you want the aliasing

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.380
 one just a little pass filter it before you send the signal in.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.420
 - Yeah, first thing I did when I had that was

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.580
 send a name and break to it from the computer.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.420
 - Oh yeah.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.020
 - Started chopping the fuck out of it.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.020
 - It kind of works really well.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:22.860
 - Yeah.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.020
 This one thing I always liked was the Rex player

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.940
 chopping a beat.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.300
 It's cool to have something in your modular

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.020
 that can live record some crazy shit you got going on

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.460
 and then just slice the fuck out of it

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.180
 and trigger the slices and how, you know,

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.340
 the length of those slices.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.180
 - Yeah.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.060
 - Because CV it's pretty fucking, that's on.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.900
 - One thing I'd like in a new Octatrack.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.860
 - Transient detection slicing like recycled style.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.100
 - It's crazy how there isn't much that has topped recycled.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:50.940
 - Yeah.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.220
 - In that regard like a shit's what, like 15 year old?

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.060
 - No, I think.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.380
 - Yeah.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.980
 - And still like de facto slicer.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.820
 - Yeah.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.620
 - Remember I bought a shitty, shitty Akai S2000

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.100
 rack mount sample that didn't fucking work very well

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.860
 just so I could hook recycle up to it

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.340
 because you know, Apex Twin did it too.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.660
 - No, I was 16.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.620
 (laughing)

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.860
 - What were you doing with like just sending like

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.460
 no data for slice or something?

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.300
 - Yeah, that's cool.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.140
 - Pretty much.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.020
 - You could, like there was a program where you could,

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.260
 yeah, it would hook up over scuzzy via recycle.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.740
 So it was really fast at the time.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.980
 It like 90s to get shit over there

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.340
 without MIDI sample dump which takes forever.

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:32.020
 So I had horrible zip drive, hell hooked up to it.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.340
 - Zip drive.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.340
 - I don't miss that shit.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.420
 (laughing)

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.820
 - Now you got your sample slicer as a kid, right?

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.340
 - Yeah.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.860
 - You could see easy 'cause it's like you spoke the build.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.100
 - All the SMD stuff is done.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.940
 You just put the jacks and the LEDs on it.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:44.780
 - That's awesome.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.620
 - Yeah.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.140
 - It took like literally under an hour to build it.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.460
 - I might have to get another one then.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.660
 - This kit format.

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:53.700
 Trash measure is the coolest new shit I got recently.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.140
 I like it.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.540
 It's pretty much the only other filter I got

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.860
 and I saw this from the Polaris right now.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.580
 - Oh, Polaris is.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.260
 - Polaris is the three of them up there, right?

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.100
 - Yeah, I like it.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.940
 - I like it.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.540
 - Like I mentioned in a previous episode,

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.700
 I always wanted to get fourth, but not like I said,

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:09.540
 I don't need to.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.980
 Like I got the Trash Master and that kinda,

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.460
 it's got a lot of character, you know what I mean?

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.620
 It does everything with the Polaris,

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.380
 like it kinda doesn't do, you know what I mean?

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.660
 Like it can get pretty unique with the tone shaping

00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.500
 and the distortions.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.820
 The filter itself is only a band pass.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.700
 It's more like a manger than like a filter.

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.860
 They're normal together, like the filter input

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.860
 and the distortion input, so you can have both, you know,

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.500
 going in and out separately.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.660
 So if you want something filtered and one thing distorted,

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.220
 you can do that or if you want your distortion post filter

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:45.460
 or pre-filter, it all just depends on how you patch it in there.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.220
 - Oh, so it's actually like which one you patch it into,

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.540
 not like switches.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.300
 - Like there's an X here, the top is the filter,

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.500
 the bottom is the station.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.540
 So a lot of functionality builds in there.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.100
 The drive has like different tone models,

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.900
 like ones based on like the tube screamer and all that shit.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.220
 It's got a high pass filter built into the distortion circuit.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.460
 So like even if you're not nice, you know,

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.060
 even if you're not messing with the band pass,

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.420
 you can still activate like the high pass mode

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.860
 on the distortion stage, scoop out some of that growliness,

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:17.020
 you know, and if you're going for like a nice high end fuzz.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.740
 Using it all weekend, usually at max gain settings.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.580
 (laughing)

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.780
 Just using it to fucks it up.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.780
 I had it like in a feedback patch,

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.780
 going to the frequency of the filters.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.220
 So like, even though it was mainly tweaking the frequency

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.340
 of it, it was also being fed back into itself,

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.140
 which was seeing, giving it a little motion, you know.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.540
 One thing I definitely learned this year

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.780
 is feedback patching from you.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.220
 I do it all the time now.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.380
 'Cause every time I be, how the fuck did you get that sound?

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.780
 Even like, oh, it's feedback, dude.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.780
 What the fuck are you talking about?

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.700
 I'm like, I don't not do that shit.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.340
 Now I do it a lot.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.900
 That's one reason why I got so hooked on the modular shit,

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.300
 dude, 'cause every time I come back to like,

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.340
 messing with something in software,

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.820
 I'd be like, I really wish I could feedback this right now.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.020
 You know, like, I don't know.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.980
 It's just something that took to like immediately

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.300
 when I started fucking with this shit,

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.420
 and it's just like, one way how like, based on it,

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.260
 if I want to keep a monitor on that, you know.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.700
 Like, can I feedback this thing?

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.460
 And get something I like out of it.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.900
 I just, I really love how it just can really hang on,

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.380
 I like things that hang on that edge.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.820
 Like, you gotta be careful.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.620
 All right, it's gonna dead.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.260
 Right on the ledge there, we go,

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.220
 falling into utter chaos or instability or something.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.460
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.820
 So you can get a lot of like, almost circuit bent type

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.060
 results out of things that are otherwise pretty stable.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.380
 Yeah. You know what I mean?

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:36.100
 It's like, yeah, I was doing all kinds of feedback shit

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:36.940
 last night.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.100
 Like, I had the herb verb feeding back into itself,

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.060
 doing some weird shit, like the feedback path,

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.700
 doing some modulation, like going to some

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.220
 of the different CV inputs.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.740
 I had all the filters were feeding back into itself.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.100
 Like, one trick I usually do with the players is

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.220
 I always use the malt outputs for the most part,

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.180
 but I also patch like the low pass into FM1,

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.860
 and just like give it a little touch of feed back.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.700
 And you know what I mean?

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.860
 On the frequency, you just goofy shit like that.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:04.700
 I don't know.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.540
 You can make a clean filter a lot more.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.340
 Absolutely flavorful.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.180
 Like the chewing in that FMF1, I almost have to do that stuff

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.180
 now, because that thing is polite as fuck.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.300
 It's like, it's really good on like full program material.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.700
 I like it for ambient stuff more.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.660
 I would never run like a lead through it.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.940
 It's just like, it's so subtle.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.620
 Yeah, that's one reason why I like the mutable blind

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:29.660
 so much is it's, 'cause you can invert your feedback path

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.660
 with it and attenuate at the same time.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.500
 Oh, sweet.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.340
 Yeah, all that shit.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.460
 So you can crucial module I feel like for a lot of feedback

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:37.260
 passion.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.100
 Yeah, I can't remember.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:38.940
 I had some other feedback.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.660
 Oh, braids.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.940
 I had a feeding back into itself for FM.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.300
 I just, I like feedback.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.900
 You know, I'm really shit a lot.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.300
 But yeah, in a live environment, you can also make your patch

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.460
 go to shit real quick.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:50.980
 Yeah.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.820
 Like I had to sound check like every, everything

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.180
 that I had going on every time, just to make sure.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.260
 Just into traveling, like, you know, the knobs.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.780
 The attenuation knobs are something that moved a little bit

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.020
 and everything gets fucked up.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.220
 Oh yeah, this was new to ever other missionists.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.060
 Not too exciting.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.260
 It's just another noise engineering module.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.540
 It's a VCA/envelope.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.580
 I think it was the 909.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:15.700
 He fashioned it off to the VCA on the 909 symbols.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.740
 So like it doesn't close like a typical circuit.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.180
 It kind of like chokes the signal.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.700
 And then like, so you get like this weird aliasing

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.980
 as like the envelope or the VCA rather is closing.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.060
 And you can control that VCA with the built-in envelope,

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.220
 sending like the screechy feedback shit I had through it

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:36.980
 just because the aliasing is nice.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.900
 Yeah, I'm starting to get a lot of noise engineering shit

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.100
 out of nowhere.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.740
 Yeah, I was doing a lot of like no input shit also.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.540
 Like even the herb herb, I had it on like the edge

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:49.060
 of self-oscillating and shit and had nothing running

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.860
 into it except for itself.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.580
 And I would mix in and out of itself.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.820
 So he's just like self-oscillating here.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.100
 And then sometimes we're running out

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.980
 and routing into itself and like going crazy and shit.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.060
 But I wasn't using it as an effect.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.620
 Because I always liked that aspect of it,

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.460
 but I didn't like it too much as an effect.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.580
 You know, so I was like, fucking, I'm gonna get it again.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.180
 But this time just use it as like its own

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.620
 standalone instrument and not necessarily an effect

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:14.460
 on anything else.

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.860
 Do we mention Sean was with us?

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.100
 I think we did.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.100
 Yeah, Sean dimensions.

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.100
 Okay.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.100
 Always physical form right now.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.900
 (laughing)

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.500
 His spirit is elsewhere.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.500
 Traveling planes.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.500
 Still laying in the couch.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:31.500
 (laughing)

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.500
 I see the bag.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.500
 (laughing)

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.500
 Working reaction skills are getting much better.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.500
 (laughing)

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.500
 Okay, we're with Sean dimensions, Samuel Ocarina.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.500
 (laughing)

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.500
 Special guest.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.500
 (laughing)

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.500
 Did you hear the new Dr. Octagon?

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.500
 There's a new one?

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.500
 Yeah.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.500
 I knew to hear the things.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.500
 Oh, I knew you were about that.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.500
 I haven't really good.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.500
 Yeah, I enjoyed it.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.500
 I know, the original was, yeah.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.500
 I loved that.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.500
 It was amazing.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.500
 I was popping up a lot recently.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.500
 Blue flowers.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.500
 Blue flowers.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.500
 Half alligator shortcut.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.500
 (laughing)

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.500
 He's so amazing.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.500
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.500
 You know, what do you like that dude?

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.500
 Seriously.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.500
 In the podcast.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.500
 Yeah, cool.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.500
 (laughing)

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.500
 I'm thinking all right.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.500
 (upbeat music)

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:21.500
 (music)

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:29.500
 (music)

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:36.500
 (music)

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:42.500
 (music)

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:49.500
 (music)

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:55.500
 (music)
