WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160
 (upbeat music)

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.740
 (upbeat music)

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:30.260
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.320
 (upbeat music)

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.600
 - Yeah, super booth-y things we wanted to talk about.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.520
 - Yeah, at the time of this recording,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.840
 super booth is, I guess, wrapping up.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.600
 - Yeah. - This is the last day

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.560
 of it, a lot of shit revealed.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.480
 Was gonna talk about the Zeta-Om Fluxus one.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.520
 - Yep, Fluxus, Fluxus.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.200
 Not really sure how you pronounce it.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.440
 - He was really cool, we met him at Nogcon last year.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.240
 - Yeah. - It was all like,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.080
 kind of based off of some dreams he was having, right?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.000
 Or something along the lines.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.880
 I think we talked about this maybe a little before.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.320
 - Yeah, I think we talked about it in our first episode,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.680
 'cause yeah, we ran into him on Saturday,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.440
 that Saturday at Nogcon.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.480
 Like we went downstairs, all the manufacturers

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.280
 were still setting up their shit.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 And so we were just kind of wandering around killing time,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.600
 and then we saw this one dude, he was already set up,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.840
 just like ready to go.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.600
 You know, he was the only one that had everything on display,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.280
 so we went over and shot the shit with him for a bit,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.480
 had no idea who he was or what he was displaying at the time,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.440
 we just saw some really colorful--

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.760
 - Yeah, the crazy buttons, it's like,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.240
 yeah, that looks crazy.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.880
 - It looks like silicone buttons.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.040
 - It looked like digital lucky charms,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.560
 glowing from across the room.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.000
 It was like-- - And lights are like that.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.320
 - Crazy, like they're all different colors, yeah.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.760
 I mean, it's not surprising that we were drawn to it.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.240
 - Yeah, it was eye-catching.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.160
 And he explained that it was a sequencer,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.600
 that it was his, I guess, first module that he's taking on,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.760
 that he basically quit his day job

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.440
 to pursue his vision of this module.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.280
 - Yeah.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.520
 - And when we asked him about the shapes and all that,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.440
 he said, yeah, it came from a vision that he had,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.040
 or a dream, so-- - Okay.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.920
 - Yeah, none of us could remember the name,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.240
 so I don't know if we mentioned it by name

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.280
 in the first episode, we just called it the dream sequencer.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.480
 (laughing)

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.200
 But now it has a name, and it's, yeah,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.000
 it's called the Fluxus One, or Fluxus One.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.560
 - And now, did he say it was an Arduino,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.160
 or a Raspberry Pi Core?

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.200
 - Ah, he does mention it.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.920
 - I think it was Arduino.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.240
 - Or maybe it was TNC, CTE.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.800
 - TNC, yeah. - It might have a TNC, yeah.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.320
 - I guess we can explain what it is

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.960
 for anyone who isn't hip to the Kickstarter,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.800
 or the Super Booth demo video.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.600
 Four-track sequencer.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.440
 Each track has two CV outs,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.600
 and I think one gate out.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.160
 - I think one gate. - Per channel, yeah.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.840
 - Up to 64 steps total.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.680
 And one of the big things that really makes it stand out

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.200
 is that it has the ARP-step,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.760
 which is fucking amazing.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.720
 Nothing out there does that right now.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.560
 You know what I mean?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.360
 Like you can have, there's things out there right now

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.760
 that can ratchet per step,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.680
 and nothing that I know of that can ARP.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.680
 Before this was revealed, I had my eye on the WMD ARP-tech,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.600
 which I'm still interested in, but at the same time,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.200
 I don't know if I'll need it.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.040
 - If I have a Fluxus one, you know what I mean?

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.960
 - Let's see that.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.840
 - So don't know how much arpeggiating I need in my rack,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.840
 but it seems like the Flux will handle a lot of that.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.600
 - Right, yeah.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.480
 - Richard Revin did the brief demo showing it.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.920
 - For the ARP-teching main.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.360
 - No, for Zito-

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.040
 - Oh, 'cause I just saw the ARP-tech one.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.280
 - Did he? - Yeah, I think so.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.280
 - I missed that one.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.560
 - It looked amazed after you described what Zito-um does.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.320
 It seemed less and less useful.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.920
 - Yeah, I would agree.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.000
 - It seemed like it had a place

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.400
 before the sequencer came along.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.280
 - I think it still does, 'cause it's kind of unique

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.640
 in that, from what I know about the ARP-tech,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.760
 you don't even need to send it a CV sequence.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.240
 Like you can generate it using gates.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.280
 - Oh, okay, so you send a clock and it's kind of like--

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.920
 - Right, I put some voltage out there.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.080
 - Yeah, it can be like its own standalone,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.480
 arpeggiation engine.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.520
 So like if you already have a bunch of sequencers

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.760
 or even gate sequencers and you wanna do some arpeggiating

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.840
 rhythms, you can get the ARP-tech.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.600
 So I don't know if you can do it just by hitting it

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.640
 with a gate and having it generate a straight ARP

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.720
 from having no CV going into it or--

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.520
 - Oh, see, I thought it was taking a sequence

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.680
 and then doing it from that.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.520
 - You can.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.480
 - Okay, that was really interesting.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.320
 - You can send something and have it,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.320
 like quantize it and arpeggiate it,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.680
 but I think you can also have it generated just by hitting

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.160
 with like a gate telling it like what clock speed type of thing

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.080
 that just generates its own.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.000
 - 'Cause my idea was, I mean, like my thought was

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.760
 taking like basically like a real simple bread and butter

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.200
 sequencer and then giving it new life,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.040
 spicing it up like that.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.080
 - Yeah, absolutely, you could do that as well.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.840
 - Especially if you've got a sequencer

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.920
 that you've had for a million years,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.360
 you're comfortable using, this would be like something

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.720
 to augment that as opposed to like the Xenaome.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.360
 If you're just gonna dive into that,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.400
 you're also going into like a whole new land of

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.560
 a brand new sequencer, not trying to give new life

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.520
 to an old sequencer.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.480
 - Right, I think there's definitely room in the market

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.480
 for both, I don't think they're gonna bang heads too much.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.320
 - Yeah.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.160
 - You know what I mean?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.000
 - Well, we could try to start shit now.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.840
 - Yeah.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.880
 - Like really instigate both of them.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.040
 Little drama going on.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.400
 - Yeah, the arpe world, too many arps.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.560
 - The only way to sort it out is to get demos of both,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.520
 you know, it's just.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.760
 - Gotta have them demo units.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.760
 - I think we need like a PO box or something for that.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.400
 - Yeah, where would you be the half one?

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.080
 - Yeah, let me do it.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.000
 - Yeah, I do.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.360
 - I've had one for a while,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.600
 'cause people steal stuff off my porch.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.440
 - That's terrible.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.280
 - You heard of that.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.240
 (laughing)

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.640
 - All right, was there anything else about the Xeno?

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.480
 'Cause I think.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.160
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.640
 You were also saying there was something about LFO.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.120
 - Oh yeah, it's a big selling point.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.000
 - Yeah, that was the other thing, really common, essentially.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.320
 Yeah, you can have the CV channels function as a LFO.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.160
 - Yeah.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.320
 - So you could essentially, just with one track,

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.200
 have it like, you know, doing sequencing,

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.600
 gate sequencing, and then have your modulation CV output

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.800
 like routed back into itself and have it do things

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.880
 like change the ARP direction.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.720
 - Yeah.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.200
 - He mentioned in the Super booth video

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.240
 that like, that is going to be a possibility.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.720
 It's just not right this second, it's not working.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.080
 So yeah, it just seems like a beast of a sequence.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.200
 - I really like the big of a slot.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.440
 Like it doesn't take up that much track.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.000
 - No, it's pretty compact.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.520
 'Cause it utilizes both the buttons for visual feedback

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.560
 as well as the LCD screen.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.000
 So I guess he was able to compact it, you know,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.920
 just into the best of both worlds there.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.760
 You know what I mean?

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.640
 Like, smaller than Renee, it's got a lot more outputs

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.640
 than Renee does, honestly.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.240
 Smaller than Renee, it's smaller than audio damage,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.600
 S1, smaller than I think the Harvest Man,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.160
 Stilson Mark II.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.920
 And it has the same amount of channels as the Stilson.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.280
 I think the Stilson is the only thing really competing

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.480
 with it right this minute.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.560
 Like I think it kind of blows away S1 personally

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.560
 'cause C1 does have the ratcheting and the CV outputs,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.000
 but it's only for the most part, one channel.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.600
 Unless you do some jacking around,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.800
 you can turn the CV outs into a second channel

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.120
 and things like that.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.200
 - So what is the Kickstarter price?

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.160
 - I think it was like $5.75.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.720
 - Well, props to him for making it look so.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.520
 I love modules that have a little personality.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.160
 You can colorful.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.440
 - Yeah, and people were already giving them shit on forums

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.640
 and even at Super Booth.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.000
 Like the one dude asked like, you know,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.440
 what's the point of these symbols?

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.840
 And he was just kind of like, you know, he likes them.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.960
 You know, he just wanted to do that.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.240
 And like someone else on the forums was like,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.520
 oh, I'm really sold on this except for the goofy button.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.720
 - Sorry, you ate fun.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.520
 - And that's exactly what he said.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.480
 That's exactly what he said when he answered the question.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.040
 Like that was why he did that.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.680
 It was he wanted to make something that was appealing

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.120
 and fun to play with.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.960
 - Yeah.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.440
 - We wanted something that was like toy like in nature.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.280
 - I can respect that.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.120
 That's pretty cool.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.320
 - I will say I do have a my own complaint.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.600
 Even though this is not something I have

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.200
 or have pre-ordered or anything.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.080
 The Jack's on the bottom.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.960
 That's a bummer.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.800
 - Oh yeah.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.640
 - You don't like that?

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.280
 - No, I want him on the top.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.120
 - Really?

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.960
 - I agree.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.800
 - See, I'm the opposite.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.080
 I like my sequencing shit towards the top generator.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.800
 Like that's why I like the layout of the variegate eight.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.200
 'Cause I like to have sequencing at the top rack.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.840
 - I want my Jacks out of the way.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.160
 I'm kind of the same way.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.000
 'Cause I want the sequencers almost at the bottom

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.640
 with the Jacks going upwards to things.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.480
 - Yes, yes.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.160
 - So I can just like, you know, variegate that kind

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.440
 of drives me a little nuts that it's not at least consistent

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.680
 with the voltage block.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.520
 - Right.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.360
 - Whatever.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.960
 - I feel you, but I disagree.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.280
 - See, because like right now, like this case in point,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.440
 like the metropolis and the voltage block,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.720
 Jacks are at the top.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.600
 So my cables when they're going out,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.240
 like I have long cables.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.160
 There's all this slack dangling then in my interface

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.200
 with variegate when you have it at the bottom,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.840
 you can put the module on the top rack

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.840
 and the cables can naturally hang down

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.840
 go where they need to go.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.680
 - The gates are pouring down into the rest of the module.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.880
 Not flowing up.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.200
 - Right.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.200
 - Yes.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.480
 - Oh, 'cause then you can start using the saving functions.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.320
 Is there like some sort of like--

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.880
 - Savings for suckers dude.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.120
 - Wow.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.480
 - To start from scratch every time.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.800
 You can, it'll save the voltage block stuff to the variegate.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.160
 - Thank you for giving me a serious answer.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.000
 - Early Bird Special is still available

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.440
 when it was 575.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.840
 - One per person.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.400
 - One per person.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.600
 Comes with stickers.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.440
 The sticker pack.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.480
 - Oh, fucking those stickers.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.400
 - I like fucking stickers dude.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.800
 - I like having stickers and rarely using them

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.000
 or putting them on things.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.640
 Just like this huge fucking box of stickers.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.760
 - Yeah, I'm the same way dude.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.440
 I mean, I'll slap them on my laptop and my modular cases,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.280
 but for the most part,

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.760
 I just like collecting stickers.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.560
 I have an entire box over there full of fucking stickers

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.920
 that I've been collecting since I was like 11.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.760
 - Sameer.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.000
 - I take the ones I don't like

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.600
 and I give them to people that I sell modules to.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.440
 - Do you really?

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.760
 - Yeah, just throw them in the box.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.120
 It's like, that's pretty cool.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.960
 - Yeah.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.800
 - It's a free swag.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.920
 - And a slight fuck you.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.440
 'Cause the stickers you don't like.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.080
 It's like here you do something with a shitty--

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.280
 - It started because I had like those void parties

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.720
 from like 2014.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.080
 I had like literally hundreds of stickers from them.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.440
 Like these are cool, but like, man,

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.080
 just like get them out of here.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.760
 So everybody that I shipped something to

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.720
 has one of those.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.320
 - Yeah, I usually just toss in like broken glass

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.920
 and syringes with everything that I sell.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.840
 - You gotta clean that up.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.680
 - Get it.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.320
 - Some nails, rusty pushpins, unpaid bills.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.520
 - Clip your toenails from into the box.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.760
 (laughing)

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.040
 - Give me bad head teeth, man.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.760
 - Don't forget to give me good feedback on muffs.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.200
 Free swag.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.560
 - Toenail clippings.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.080
 - Cat litter.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.000
 - Little screw bag full of cat litter.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.680
 (laughing)

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.400
 - Is that M3 or M2.5 cat litter?

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.320
 - I can't wait for the thread that shows up.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.160
 New question.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.600
 What am I supposed to do with this cat litter?

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.000
 (laughing)

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.760
 - Which way does the red stripe go on the cat litter?

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.720
 - That's what the cat litter's for, man.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.720
 - In summary.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.640
 - Yeah, this one looks very promising.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.960
 I wish him the best of luck with his Kickstarter.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.000
 - Nice dude, nice dude.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.840
 - Nice dude.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.560
 - Yeah, and it's solid to see someone new to the scene

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.000
 who isn't just trying to be a crowd pleaser.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.840
 - Yeah.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.360
 - Like he's just doing his own thing,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.840
 pursuing his own vision.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.200
 It's not like he was sitting there thinking,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.840
 oh, what is everyone asking for on the forums?

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.720
 You know, what can I make that'll cash in?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.960
 He's pursuing something completely original

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.800
 and hoping that people just enjoy what he's doing.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.640
 - You know what I mean?

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.360
 - Anyone who starts there, this came from a dream.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.360
 I'm pretty much on board.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.200
 - Yeah.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.040
 - Yeah, go for it.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.880
 Let's see what you get in there.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.480
 - This came from a vision I had in a dream.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.560
 - It was sold.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.800
 - I don't even know what it does.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.280
 - Okay, so there was a, there was other things on our list

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.160
 for Super Booth related things.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.200
 - Digitact.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.040
 - Yes.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:31.040
 - That's cool to see it actually working, making sound.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.600
 - Became a little more clear.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.320
 - Yeah, a little more clear on the features.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.680
 Like big one for me is I was curious about,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.760
 will the micro timing and the trigger conditions

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.200
 apply to the midi side of it,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.040
 which it definitely didn't on the Octatrack

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.160
 'cause none of that stuff existed.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.440
 And they confirmed that.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.520
 So that's a huge plus for me.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.680
 That's just gonna be awesome.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.320
 I have a midi sequencer like that built into it.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.360
 I was worried it was just gonna be

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.760
 the Octatrack sequencer, which it's simple and it's nice,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.120
 but like it's a little, I want something a little more,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.440
 a little spoiled by the rhythm trigger conditions

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.480
 and having those in midi will be pretty nice.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.200
 - I saw that he mentioned there was parameter locking.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.680
 - Yeah, everything parameter locking control all like function,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.160
 if you remember that from the machine drum.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.560
 So if you can take like hit the function button

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.800
 and control the decay for all the eight tracks

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.680
 at the same time, that's kind of a neat thing.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.080
 Seeing the sampling of the device was cool

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.720
 because it's really easy to take like any recording.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.960
 Still kind of odd that it's a mono box.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.920
 I kind of get it, but if it was stereo,

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.640
 I think it would be like that much cooler.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.480
 - Yeah.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.040
 - But again, in that it can resample itself internally

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.880
 really easily, that's like another big selling point.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.760
 - But it started to become clear like the corners

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.520
 that had to be cut in order to get

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.600
 that ridiculous price point.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.360
 - Is stereo really that much of a price jump though?

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.040
 - Oh, I guess, but I mean, if you're doing it in stereo

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.040
 and you wanna have true stereo,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.880
 I'd imagine there's a lot of--

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.040
 - You need to double the memory.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.560
 - Yeah, double a few things, but still that like--

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.040
 - It's not just track with stereo, you know?

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.880
 - Yeah.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.080
 - But it's not just a matter to putting another jack on there.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.920
 You know what I mean?

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.640
 - I mean, I think there's a lot of considerations

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.480
 that need to be made.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.320
 - Yeah.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.800
 I mean, obviously, yeah, each sample would be double in size

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.240
 and I guess your working project memory

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.920
 would have to be double, but--

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.040
 - And as it stands now, it's what, 64 meg from project?

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.960
 - Yeah, like for the active project

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.160
 and then a gig on the plus drive.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.000
 - Okay.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.680
 - But it's all gotta be loaded in memory.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.040
 One cool thing though is they finally like,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:26.880
 some people don't like this,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.200
 but there are no kits anymore.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.560
 It's all saved to the pattern, even the BPM.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.400
 So you don't have to worry--

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.880
 - That's an improvement, I'm sure.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.800
 - For me, that's like great, finally.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.360
 You know, I don't really care about kits.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.480
 I just wanna hear like what I played back

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.640
 without having to like worry about ruining it.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.480
 - So that's good to see.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.680
 I think they're learning like to make something

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.000
 that's a little simpler, but hopefully,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.680
 like we said before, that they continue to make

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.760
 some flagship devices that have a little more.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.160
 - Yeah, I'm still surprised about the stereo thing

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.960
 'cause it's like, yeah, right before this,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.800
 they're released heat, which is--

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.080
 - That's a good point, you know what I mean?

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.920
 - You know what I mean?

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.920
 - Stereo distortion, you can run your stuff through it

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.800
 and then their next item to follow up with it--

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.800
 - Mono. - Mono.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.200
 I'm just like, okay, I use the rhythm

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.840
 for sampling a lot and that's Mono only as well.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.720
 And I was kind of hoping this thing would make me,

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.640
 would inspire me to buy it, offer something more

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.360
 than what the rhythm can already do

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.080
 if using it as a sequencer.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.840
 It's kind of the same, you know?

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.960
 - Yes, very similar.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.280
 - Same tree conditions, which is cool,

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.040
 but nothing new as far as tree conditions go

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.240
 and still Mono and it's just like a--

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.080
 - Yeah.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.640
 - And it's still basically just a phrase sampler, you know what I mean?

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.000
 Like, you're not gonna be doing any Octatrack long--

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 - Not long samples, samples, yeah,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.320
 it's like all meant for one shot, drum.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.200
 - There was some cool stuff that he demoed a chunk

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.560
 about setting the start points

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.320
 and how you can actually see the waveform now

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.560
 and that was really cool 'cause it seems like,

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.360
 you know, in the Octatrack or the rhythm,

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.160
 it's just kind of like zero to 128,

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.920
 and you kind of get that much resolution,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.360
 and you kind of gotta see, oh, hope it's somewhere in there,

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.640
 but this seemed like it was much finer control

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.160
 over like getting into those slices.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.400
 - Now, is there a way to actually control

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.920
 the start and end points on each of these samples

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.600
 as you're playing a part of rhythm?

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.000
 So that seems kind of cool, so you could actually maybe

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.440
 have something a little bit longer

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.600
 and then not too long, obviously,

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.400
 but you could screw around with the start and end points

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.560
 and get a little bit of variation from that.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, there was some interesting,

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.520
 like they demoed some kind of granular stuff,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.000
 but it's nothing, you can't really do right now

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.800
 except it looks like there's finer control

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.640
 over how deep you can zoom in on the start and end,

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.480
 which is cool. - Yeah, you did mention

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.000
 that it's new encoders.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.640
 - Yeah, they looked really nice.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.640
 We'll see how it is, like I've got one,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.600
 I'm just waiting for the UPS notification

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.240
 whenever they do chip it, but I don't think that,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.040
 it looks, I've never seen the MIDI demoed at all.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.720
 It looks like they haven't even really started with it.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.640
 - What is the ETA on shipping?

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.960
 - They said May, it's just going.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.800
 - Oh, really?

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.640
 - Yeah, okay, I will.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.480
 - So I thought this was going to be like end of summer.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.320
 - Mm-mm.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.240
 - Well, that's weird, 'cause that's one month away

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.400
 and they're still kind of a bit secretive, I guess,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.840
 about everything that this thing can and can't do.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.360
 - Totally, Super Booth was his first time

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.320
 that actually made sound that anybody could really hear

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.840
 and the first time they talked about a lot of features

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.000
 that were in question.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.360
 - I think it's still confusing.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.320
 I think there's still people talking online,

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.520
 like asking questions, like,

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.000
 does this thing have a fucking drum engine in it?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.200
 It's like, nope, it's a sampler, pure and simple.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.360
 - It's a month away.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.200
 - Right.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.560
 - People should be able to start planning.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.640
 If I'm going to buy this, this is what it can do.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.480
 - Right.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.400
 - And no one can do that yet.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.920
 - Right, like, did they jump the gun

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.960
 because of the MPC live and the MPC X thing?

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.720
 Like, it was hard to tell if it was some like,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.520
 oh shit, we're going to get like,

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.760
 everybody's going to want this

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.280
 and they're going to like try to pre-order it

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.240
 and save money before they know we're out.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.440
 - It was like a two part issue, in my opinion.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.200
 Like, part of it was being secretive with the specs

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.640
 and what it actually, you know, can, can't do the details.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.960
 And then the other part was some of it

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.720
 just seemed intentionally misleading.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.400
 Like, we discussed in a previous episode.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.240
 And you know what I mean?

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.000
 Like, the labels on the buttons,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.200
 you would presume that those are in relation

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.960
 to like the drum synthesis engine that it has inside of it

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.120
 and it doesn't have a drum synthesis engine.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.920
 And so it's like, why the fuck are these buttons pre-labeled?

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.200
 - And if you're being playful

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.040
 and that's, you can put whatever you want there,

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.920
 just fucking say it.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.840
 We just thought that'd be funny.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.600
 That's where the cowbells should go.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.000
 But we're not actually giving you a cowbell.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.880
 - Yeah, like, like, last episode,

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.480
 the data lines explanation for that was,

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.200
 well, it's a throwback to our classic machine drum.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.120
 That's not a throwback 'cause this thing isn't,

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.720
 in any way, she'll perform a fucking machine drum.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.560
 So it just seems intentionally misleading.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.400
 I don't know.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.520
 - It was just silly for me because all the electron products,

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.600
 if you get some rubbing alcohol,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.480
 you could just take all the labels off anyway.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.280
 The first thing I would do if I got this thing,

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.040
 I'm cowbell your first.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.880
 You're gone.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.880
 - I don't even wanna see that word.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.120
 - Yeah, but we'll see.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.200
 - Well, you'll see.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.040
 - I will see.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.880
 - And then we'll all see.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.800
 - In one month.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.480
 - Yeah, hopefully.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.680
 I'm excited 'cause I definitely wanna have it

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.560
 in front of the module or just picking up

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.720
 drum samples really quickly.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.360
 Like I was telling Dave earlier,

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.080
 I've had the same samples on my rhythm for a while now.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.360
 Like the same 'cause it's a little annoying

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.680
 to get them on there and then you don't wanna take it off

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.560
 'cause it's like, oh, I did use it in that pattern.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.560
 And then you're kinda stuck.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.960
 So I met some point, like I wanna,

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.640
 we'll see if I can do it, like clear off the rhythm

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.320
 and just start completely fresh again,

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.680
 but right now it's like every bank and every pattern

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.400
 is full with all this stuff that I'm trying to record

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.880
 or like is part of live set.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.720
 So I have multiple projects on there still,

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.760
 that's kinda why I stopped using it live at the moment.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.120
 Like for a while, I was gonna bring it out

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.200
 with the teraz and the modular.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.480
 And then like over time, after doing some practice,

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.360
 that's not, I just kinda slowly took the rhythm

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.800
 out of the live setup.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.280
 It's too complicated.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.880
 Like you said, like if I decide just one night,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.840
 oh, I don't want this sample on here anymore,

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.320
 but I find out it's like glocked

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.680
 into a couple of different patterns

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.320
 and I forgot and it just fucks up the whole project.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.480
 So I don't know, it's more like a studio tool

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.840
 for me at this point.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.840
 And--

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.280
 - Had the sounds from it, ended up on the teraz?

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.640
 - Yes. - Yes.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.560
 - In fact for the last, that tour we did,

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.040
 December I ended up bouncing a lot of things out

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.600
 of the rhythm and ended up going right into the teraz.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.200
 - And that's the thing, like I can't even play a live set

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.200
 without the rhythm now.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.600
 It's like, that's the only drum machine I'll be able to use.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.880
 So I'm hoping the Digitak might cover some of that.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.400
 - So you just wanna like sample chunks of the modular

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.600
 into it live, basically?

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.440
 - Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.280
 - I do that a lot.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.800
 They end up in the rhythm sometimes,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.160
 but they usually end up in the octa track.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.320
 And that's kinda gone.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.080
 - Right. - Three of ones on the way

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.760
 and the Digitak two, like pretty big samplers.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.240
 So those are like, I don't have much sampling stuff

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.440
 at all right now.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.120
 Just the radio music. - That's weird.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.400
 Yeah, yeah. - 'Cause you're like

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.280
 the sampling dude.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.280
 - I like some samples.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.480
 I like cutting that shit up.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.880
 - Is that the segue into the tip top one discussion?

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.400
 - Oh yeah, tip top one.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.240
 - Yeah.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.080
 - No.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.360
 - No, it is.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.880
 Tip top one, I thought sounds fantastic.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.560
 It did like, especially the tempo pack on there

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.280
 was like 2496 stuff and I don't play with stuff

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.600
 like at that range much.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.320
 But when you pitch it down,

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.480
 there's like some awesome high frequency,

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.280
 like ghosty kind of stuff that comes out

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.440
 that normally is just gone, I feel.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.880
 So it was cool to like pitch something down

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.680
 and be like, yeah, that sounds all right.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.200
 But no display, like just the rotary.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.960
 If it was a pot instead of a rotary,

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.160
 you could at least be like, oh, at like two o'clock,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.520
 I've got like my bass drums there or something.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.680
 But with this, you can keep turning it left

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.120
 and you never get to like the first sample in the list

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.040
 and you just stop.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.920
 It's just constantly rotating around.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.240
 So it's like total wheel of fortune live.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.320
 So without some method of queuing it,

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.480
 it's just, I don't know where I'm at right now.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.720
 And that's like kind of--

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.520
 - So there's no way to do that independently

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.760
 from the knob with like CV and be like,

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.920
 okay, this voltage, it'll play that sample.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.760
 - No, that is still relative to the,

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.160
 - There's this sequence mode where apparently

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.960
 if you have it in this mode and you hit it

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.400
 with a voltage, it'll start playing these samples

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.600
 in a certain sequence.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.920
 But I just wanted like a knob on the voltage block

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.720
 to correspond to like what I thought

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.320
 this thing would be as a reset.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.640
 - You can't really do that from what I know.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.240
 - And even in that mode, it's only a range of 32 samples, right?

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.240
 - Yeah.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.600
 - And you can't like exceed that.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.360
 - I think you could do 64, but still it was like

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.440
 a lot to go through with that, don't we?

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.280
 - Gotcha, okay.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.280
 - And you know, you only get your pitch

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.440
 for that one sample fixed.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.880
 You can't set the pitch of samples on there

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.000
 and have it retain that.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.200
 So you can't ever get like retained pitch up and down.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.760
 The jack layout is really confusing.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.800
 They have the labels are offset to the point where

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.200
 the jack is associated with the printing shifted.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.800
 So it's actually at the jack above.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.840
 So the text is closer to that jack.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.200
 So I was always like, oh wait, the CV in the gate?

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.080
 No, it's the gate.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.480
 I put it in the CV again.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.400
 Like for whoever they had beta tested,

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.720
 it was probably more like, oh yeah,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.960
 it does the things you said it should do.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.720
 But nobody ever took a step back to be like,

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.360
 well, if you did this though, it'd be like 1,000 times

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.680
 more useful.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.440
 There was kind of some thrashing on the forum

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.760
 when people were like, well, just let me set a value

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.560
 in the text file for this thing and just have it

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.320
 always start on this sample.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.000
 So I know every time it's like here.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.360
 And they were like, if we do that,

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.760
 we're going to add another loop to the code

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.160
 and it's going to mess up the latency,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.440
 like the point to five milliseconds latency.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.600
 Yeah.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.320
 But it's not, I don't have one anymore

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.560
 because of that reason, right?

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.760
 Yeah, so the same discussion going about the save state.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.600
 Yes.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.600
 If you turn it off and back on, it doesn't retain any

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.440
 of your settings.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.920
 People were saying like, can we please add this?

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.040
 And then I guess Ger replied and said, we do that,

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.040
 that's more code and then we're going to fuck up the latency.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.040
 But these weren't minor grievances for a lot of people.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.560
 Right.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.400
 You know what I mean?

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.400
 Like you said, there's a lot of people

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.600
 who are just deciding to not continue to use it

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.720
 because of these little things.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.920
 Things that I guess tip-top thought were little things

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.720
 that people wouldn't mind.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.240
 Right.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.520
 Or actually really hurting usefulness of this module.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.080
 Because in the studio, it doesn't matter.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.000
 Just dial up the sound you want and like start recording.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.520
 And live, I was kind of fumbling around like, oh,

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.720
 there it is.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.680
 Even the radio music is so easy to be like, oh,

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.800
 here's the LED for the bank.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.880
 I'll go to bank 2 and I'll scroll through

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.040
 and there's my sample.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.120
 It's really quick to kind of get where you had your stuff.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.080
 I've never messed with the one or the radio music one,

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.720
 but I do have the Pico drum from Erika.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.120
 And it's-- I kind of like it.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.960
 You can save the state and then you have to load it again.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.480
 But at least it has the ability to do it.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:30.920
 Yeah.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.680
 And you can also adjust the pitch and have it scan

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.280
 different samples while you configure that.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.440
 And it uses a weird little like six LED display

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.120
 to tell you what samples you're on.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.240
 So it doesn't tell you like, buying number.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.800
 It looks like little alien symbols basically.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.240
 You know what I mean?

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.240
 That lights up a different way.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.760
 Yeah, so you know there's some reference.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.240
 Yeah.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.440
 These are all things that the one does not have.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.320
 And I think the one is more expensive, right?

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.720
 I can't remember the price for the Pico,

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.040
 but I think it's cheaper than that.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.680
 Yeah, I think it's a little cheaper.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.640
 And you can do two drums on the Pico.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.480
 It's pretty cool.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.000
 Yeah.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.840
 That you just flip the switch.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.240
 Do they have their own gate and CV?

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.040
 They share the CV.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:12.560
 Yeah.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:12.760
 OK.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.720
 But they have two dedicated gate inputs.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.400
 Oh, that's cool.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.680
 And then you flip the switch to tell it which CV

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.120
 you wanted to be affecting or which drum the knob is controlled.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.680
 Oh, that sounds infinitely better than the one.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.720
 Yeah, it seemed a little better thought out.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.200
 Yeah.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.440
 Than the one.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.800
 That's why I bought the Pico.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.120
 Like, I bought the Pico at the same time the one was announced.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.040
 And so I was kind of torn at first, which one to get.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.840
 And then the more I read on specs,

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.520
 I just kind of leaned more towards the Pico.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.160
 And so far, I'm happy with it.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:36.840
 Get in like it.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.520
 I'm surprised that people are buying the four packs of the ones.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.640
 Because it seems like they could make a bigger module that

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.320
 maybe had a little more control.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.240
 But then that goes away from exactly what they tried to do.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.560
 So I get it.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.640
 It just didn't work for me.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.720
 It's not what I want.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.800
 Or if you bought the four pack, that's essentially

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.920
 the cost of the bitbox.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.240
 Yeah.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:57.920
 Or the 301.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.280
 At that point, it was the 301.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.640
 Yeah, at which point.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.720
 Which has given you like 12 times more power.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.640
 So it's like, I don't know why.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.720
 Yeah, I don't see the appeal of the four pack.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.960
 If you just need a simple little drum sample module,

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.680
 then I can see just toss someone in there.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.080
 But if you're looking at four of them, obviously,

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.080
 your drum needs exceeds that that the one can do.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.400
 And it's time to look at something like bitbox or something.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.680
 So you have to use the cart.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.680
 You can't--

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.180
 Yeah.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.020
 --the port directly into it.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.120
 No.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.120
 That's another thing.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.360
 It doesn't sample.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.560
 It's sample playback.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.280
 Right, right.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.000
 However, that is one thing that I'll give the tip top one

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.600
 is that it's interface for putting sounds into it

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.080
 is definitely easier than the Pico.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.320
 Like the Pico, you have to have a special adapter

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.080
 and it connects to the back.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.360
 And then you upload shit that way.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.800
 Yeah, whereas like the one, it's all in a little card.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.840
 And it's up front.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.360
 Yeah.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.080
 So it's definitely got one up on the Pico in that regard.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.680
 Yeah.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.920
 I'm eyeing up that audio damage.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.760
 That end-so looks awesome.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.280
 Yeah, the end-so.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.360
 Like it's the same--

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.040
 I think it's the functionality that we wanted.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.800
 It's a lot closer to like, hey, let me take a loop.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.760
 Maybe do some replicant stuff with it

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.040
 and just kind of like have a bank of loops

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.320
 that I can actually sample onto this thing really easily.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.280
 They did do--

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.440
 I don't know if you guys saw a video.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.280
 I think it was just yesterday posted up from Super Booth

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:23.880
 regarding it.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.560
 Like he plays around with it a little bit.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.800
 Oh, yeah, I saw part of that.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.800
 It looks good.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.360
 It looks good.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.040
 What stood out to you as being appealing about it?

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.720
 The interface for one thing.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.400
 It looks super fucking nice and easy to use.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.400
 OK.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.000
 From what I can tell, there's going to be other modes

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.960
 where you can slice, which is what I am really excited about.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.440
 You know what I mean?

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.880
 I want to be able to record a beat in my modular

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.320
 and then flip over to the recorded beat

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.440
 and slice and dice the fucking thing.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.600
 You want modular recycle?

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.120
 Exactly.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:52.480
 Yeah.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.760
 And I think that's what this is going to do.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.520
 He said it's modeled after the Looper in Ableton,

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.440
 which he was talking about a replicant mode.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:02.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.240
 Like the VST.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.080
 And that had some pitch shifting for slice, things like that.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.440
 And so I don't know to what level of craziness

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.360
 it'll be able to achieve.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.600
 But even at its most basic as a looper,

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.880
 it still seems very appealing.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.960
 So all the other shit that he's adding to it

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.320
 will be, I think, a nice bonus for sure.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.120
 So what's the ETA?

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.200
 I mean, how much time do you think he's

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.920
 going to have to develop and add to shit to it?

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.800
 I don't know.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.480
 Yeah, I didn't hear what he did.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.720
 I don't think he really announced it.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.960
 He said that basically they were focusing on the EOS verb

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.480
 first, which is now out as of--

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.440
 that was like their other Superbooth reveal,

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.240
 was the EOS and the Anso.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.840
 And I have the EOS.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.640
 I pre-ordered it.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.560
 It's here.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.360
 I've been using it.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.400
 Right.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.560
 But yeah, I'm definitely keeping an eye on the Anso.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.760
 But 301 seems a bit too expensive and too much for me.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.160
 But I can definitely see it being up your alley.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.360
 Yeah, I'm excited.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.560
 It feels like the stuff that I wanted the OctaTrack to be

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.120
 is kind of in there.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.040
 I didn't use the OctaTrack for loops as much as I did for one

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.160
 shots that I wanted to kind of mess up

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.640
 and have a strange sequence.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.960
 I think that thing working with the varigate and the voltage

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.560
 block will be a lot of fun.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.440
 But it's very beta.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.160
 I know he just redid the UI for everything.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.760
 So there's this release for the 301 that's literally just

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.500
 like a new plugin architecture and an SDK for people

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.960
 to make more plugins and stuff on their own outside of him

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.400
 being available to do it.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.000
 So--

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.040
 Yeah, it's interesting to see so many samplers just

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.560
 explode on the scene.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.480
 Not only just in modular, but just stand alone too.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.360
 There's a lot going on with sampling right now.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.920
 Yeah, and even that radio music, he just

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.080
 added time stretching to that.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:50.640
 Oh, really?

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.000
 Yeah, and I think they--

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.080
 I don't know if this was in or not,

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.680
 but some ability to change pitch in the radio music.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.160
 Because when I got the radio music module a couple weeks ago,

00:29:59.160 --> 00:29:59.840
 I used it.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.520
 I'm like, oh, it plays back a sample.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.680
 This is very static, though.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.400
 You're just literally scrubbing the start point

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.960
 to go through the stations that you have.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.720
 So that's it.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.880
 That's all you can do with it.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.800
 It'd be cool to play back a long sample in a small module.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.280
 It's awesome.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.320
 But I have it on the chord machine,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.200
 mostly just to play back.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.440
 That firmware is pretty cool.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.320
 Sounds pretty good.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.400
 I don't have anything that's poly in my modular cell

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.640
 for a little hits like that.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.760
 It's pretty fun.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.320
 Yeah, it sounded like a compact techno machine.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.680
 Yeah, it pretty much is.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.400
 Get some rave stabs out of there.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:32.920
 Yeah.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.200
 It's also thinking the opposite of--

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.080
 it's the drone machine.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.400
 So you have a 1950s radio announcement about nuclear fallout.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.240
 And you have that behind your drone.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.360
 And it's just 20 minutes.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.040
 People talking about what you're

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.560
 supposed to do when the bombs drop

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.160
 and letting that go while you're going to town on another drone.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.000
 That's funny because I think that is literally

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.080
 one of the default samples that you get with it.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:57.640
 Are you serious?

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.520
 People talking about nuclear accidents and stuff like that.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.120
 There's a big community of sample packs for that thing

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.400
 that you can download because it's

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.200
 the raw format, not wave.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.920
 So people just make like, oh, here's like 20 gigs

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.000
 because it'll take a 32 gig card or whatever.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.840
 Yeah, yeah, there's a ton of stuff you can put on there.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.640
 Call it a day.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.000
 Wow.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.600
 Nice to hear it.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.360
 Good for me to call it cliche.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.320
 I'm so fucking creative.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.560
 I was interested in having chords,

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.400
 but now that I have the SIG-UTS deluxe, it was coming.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:29.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.520
 My way I'm real stoked about the chords mode on that thing

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.920
 because I like the lo-fi 8-bit chords.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.480
 That's what makes this cool is it.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.520
 It sounds kind of shitty.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.320
 Does it?

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.560
 It sounds like it's even modded after the Omni-Chord

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.240
 or whatever those kind of--

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.120
 it's not very high res, and that's

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.560
 the part that I like about it.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.000
 It's like when you have the sine wave mode,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.560
 it's just really dark and kind of like, hmm.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.320
 Kind of grimy.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.000
 Yeah, it's not like just hitting a VST chord or something.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.240
 I don't think that would have a little bit of character.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:00.960
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.000
 Now how many different wave forms are in there?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.280
 Oh, they just-- before it was just four,

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:13.520
 you got a saw square sine and then some like dirtier saw

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.800
 sine, but then they added another update where you get four

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.120
 more now.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.040
 And you can actually put your own wave table on it now.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.680
 You can upload a little 8-bit wave tables

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.040
 and it will read them as the other four.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:27.360
 Cool.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.720
 Oh, but there's still variations of like square?

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.640
 No, it's just whatever you want to put out.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.880
 Yeah, they just added that like a couple weeks ago.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.000
 Have you scooted around with that?

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.520
 Nope.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.200
 It's funny because I couldn't get it to work the other night.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.560
 Like it's-- the one thing about teensies that I don't like

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.440
 and this too is that you have to like--

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.160
 if you want to update it to change the mode,

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.520
 you've got to pull it out of the modular and then update it

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.240
 in the back.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.520
 I don't recommend it as a kit.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.720
 I think it's a little difficult.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.240
 It's really tight.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.080
 Like it's a really tight--

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:54.680
 I almost think--

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.280
 --janky.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:59.240
 When I was buying all the knobs from Thonk in my last order,

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.560
 I was like, yeah, maybe I'll toss in a chord machine kit.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:03.560
 Yeah.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.120
 Is it the same sort of like risers you need to do?

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.200
 There's like a three.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.160
 It's like a stack of three of them.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.760
 And it's like kind of bendy.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.800
 Dude, it's not--

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.800
 I was like, oh, it's only a 4-HB module.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.840
 I could probably handle that.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.360
 Yeah.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:16.960
 But yeah.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.400
 It should be--

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.160
 I would have probably royally screwed it up.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.920
 It should be 8-HP, a little wider, with like a better,

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.920
 more stable base.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.680
 It's not the best design.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.660
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:49.120
 I guess I could just talk about EOS in general.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:49.620
 Yeah.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:50.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:56.040
 As it stands now, it's my fourth dedicated reverb module

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.200
 in my setup.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.200
 Currently, not like over time.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.120
 Yeah, currently.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.800
 It's number four.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.160
 If you include clouds as a reverb.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:05.680
 Yeah.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.680
 The olive herb, I'm sure.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.560
 I mean, I use it every once in a while, but I just--

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.480
 I don't like dedicating clouds to a reverb.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:12.960
 Yeah.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.460
 Yeah.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.360
 I feel like it's a nice bonus feature in there.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.760
 But yeah, I have the herb verb.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.120
 I have the halls of a holocart for ZDSP, have clouds.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:29.000
 And now I have the audio damage, EOS, and not a morphogen.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.520
 And not a morphogen.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.880
 A morphogen.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.480
 Yeah, I mean, I like it overall.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.560
 I don't feel it can compare to any of the other reverbs,

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.000
 either.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.520
 I have four, and I think they all hold their own.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.840
 So where do you see yourself using this over the other ones?

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.520
 Mostly on percussion things.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.240
 I feel like the halls of a hola is still the king

00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:01.360
 when it comes to big spaces, big halls, giant sounding reverb.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:05.640
 Very lush, very large.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.960
 And it can handle hot and distorted sounds

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.240
 and even make that sound nice, whereas I can't do that

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.880
 with any of the other ones.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.480
 And even though the EOS is kind of like, I don't know,

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.400
 I guess, advertised as such.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.680
 Being able to go into infinite mode

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.800
 and have long decay times and things like that,

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.880
 it just sounds nowhere near as lush, in my opinion.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:36.160
 I use the EOS plugin a lot, like with Prometheus burning

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.000
 on drum sounds.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.360
 And I feel like that's where I get the most.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.800
 I feel like the plate mode is at strong point

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.680
 over the Super Hall mode, which is weird,

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.640
 because it was designed by the same guy, like Sean Costello

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.960
 made the halls of a hola and cart and all those plugins.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.880
 And he worked with audio damage on this, but it's just,

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.480
 I don't know, it's just not very good, in my opinion,

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.880
 for the Super Hall stuff.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.840
 Now, you mentioned the VST, which you used a lot of.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.960
 How does it compare to the VST?

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.520
 It sounds just like it.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.840
 You know what I mean?

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.040
 It's a little different.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.760
 It doesn't have the base multiplier.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.600
 What was that?

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.440
 What was that?

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.240
 I don't remember that.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.400
 It had the ability to boost the low end.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.720
 So it really was like those old radios

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.400
 with the base boost button.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.240
 Kind of.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.360
 It was more than an EQ.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.040
 It was almost like it let that energy kind of build up.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:31.880
 Okay, right.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.640
 Right back.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.480
 Gotcha.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.320
 Yes.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.160
 Yeah.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.680
 Like in the reverb, you could achieve very dark sounds

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.680
 with it and also heavy.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.520
 Oh, okay.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.040
 You know, and I like that a lot.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.040
 You could get some very dark damp,

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.680
 bassy reverbs out of it.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.520
 And I use--

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.640
 It doesn't have that.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.960
 It doesn't have the base boost.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.680
 It has color control though, which you can CV, which is nice.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.720
 Like at 12 o'clock, it's kind of neutral.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.320
 You turn it to the right and it's kind of like a high pass

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.920
 and it'll bring out more of the high end harmonics.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.880
 And if you turn it counterclockwise,

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.320
 it starts to like dampen and kind of bring out

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:18.960
 the more dark damp sounds, which you can't get as dark and bassy

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.560
 as you can with the VST.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.920
 That functionality is just not there.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.400
 And that's one reason why I like that on drums a lot too.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.160
 You can make some really dark, plated, you know,

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.640
 reverby percussion sounds.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.200
 So that's probably where I'll be using the module as well.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.640
 Whereas like herb herb, I always

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.200
 felt as like good for like metallic percussion stuff

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.680
 and just weird sound design shit.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:46.440
 And four different modules, no overlap at all.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.800
 Not overkill in any way.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.960
 And if someone released another one,

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.000
 you wouldn't hesitate to give that fifth.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.080
 I've already looked at the sonic potions one,

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.360
 which is still not out yet.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.560
 Oh yeah.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.360
 But I am curious about what that one does.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.280
 I like reverbs almost as much as distortion for shaping sound,

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.640
 you know.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.840
 That brings me to a good thing we could probably talk about

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.680
 though, is those channel strip modules.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.640
 Oh yeah.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.600
 By feedback.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.600
 Yeah.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.360
 Which is a company I've never heard of before.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.400
 It was called Feedback Modular.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.240
 Where are they from?

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:18.760
 Do you remember?

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.760
 I have no idea.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.720
 I don't think it's United States though.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.840
 Because the currency was--

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.000
 Yeah, there was by default.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.400
 Right.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.320
 There was some currency conversion on the website

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.160
 when I checked it out.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:32.760
 But basically they made a line of three different types of--

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.320
 They were emulating three old mixers.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.480
 They were a channel each.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.240
 Yes.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.440
 Of these old mixers.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.560
 And they were being a little bit cagey about who they actually

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.320
 were.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.080
 Yeah, because I don't think they're allowed to say.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:44.800
 Right.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.080
 Because copyright and frangering are not--

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.880
 Considering how much desk space it takes

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.800
 to have these old mixing consoles that you're only using

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.320
 for a one trick pony.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:55.960
 Yes.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.920
 Barely works still.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.920
 Yes.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.480
 You know, and you can stream it down to one or two modules.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.680
 Very appealing.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.080
 Yeah.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.760
 And they had a ton of audio samples,

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.240
 which was also really helpful.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.320
 Very much--

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.560
 And they all did sound different.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.160
 Yes.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.960
 There was a wild variation.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.960
 Whether or not they sound true to what they're emulating,

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.720
 or it doesn't even have an emulation.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.880
 It's supposed to be a direct port almost.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:24.640
 Like you use the same components that were per channel.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.080
 But you can kind of decipher the code names.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.320
 One was meant to be the old boss, I guess that's the BX8.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.880
 Yeah, I think.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.920
 One was supposed to be--

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.120
 Wait, are you going to be in trouble

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.800
 by unveiling their code?

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.280
 No, as long as they don't name it,

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.040
 as long as they can't get in trouble.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:46.320
 But what was that, like, KMX or KM8 from boss to--

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.000
 Was it two different bosses?

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.120
 I think so.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.600
 OK.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.800
 And then the one was the CR1604 or whatever.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.120
 Yes.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.160
 Because it was the CR something then.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:55.720
 Yes.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.960
 Which is basically like 1202, like that old order style

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.000
 AMP design.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.880
 Which was the one that was most appealing to me.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.320
 Yeah.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.640
 Because before they moved it to--

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.080
 when they were still made in the US,

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.760
 and they were slightly different than when they made them

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.840
 all in China.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.720
 And their talent changed or whatever.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.520
 Yeah.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.000
 They all sounded good.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.080
 They all had different character.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:21.240
 And I would like to see how they stack up, like literally,

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.640
 like how they stack up if I run like one into another to another.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.320
 You know what I mean?

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.880
 Compared to like an actual mixer, like can they handle that?

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.560
 You know what I mean?

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.560
 It would sound the old insert effect trick.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.400
 Right.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:32.880
 Yeah.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.160
 Could you actually just make like a Frankenstein mixer?

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:35.680
 Exactly.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.120
 Just like one of each of those.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:37.640
 Exactly.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.640
 That'd be cool.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.680
 I'm looking forward to getting at least two of them

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.480
 and trying them out.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.520
 Because you're not expensive.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.520
 I have an order with them yet.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.080
 But it's definitely on my to buy list.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.720
 I want to try them out, put them through their paces.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.240
 I've been using my Mackey 1202.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.840
 It's just TR8 is always running into it.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.400
 I don't have a few pedals in it.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.200
 Just because the TR8's a little-- you know, it's like a little--

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.680
 I don't like it when it's clean.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.200
 Right.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.360
 Much, exactly.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.640
 For the size and the price, it's definitely

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.640
 like the feeling.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.840
 I mean, something I've talked about a lot.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.340
 You know?

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:11.080
 And I wish somebody would make this as a module.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.920
 And then without much fanfare, somebody

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.000
 did for three different mixing consoles.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.960
 You know, I mean, like out of nowhere, just stumbled upon us

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.920
 and go, it's what we've always discussed.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.000
 It actually exists now.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.040
 I need to give it a shot.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.200
 I bought one solely because of you being like, look,

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.240
 here's what it does.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:26.960
 It's like, who's shit?

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.440
 Like 120 bucks?

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.040
 It's like distortion pedal, you know?

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:30.400
 Yeah.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.480
 It's like, that's the sound.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.720
 It's like four distortion pedals.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.240
 Yeah.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.240
 True.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.240
 That's the--

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.200
 That VGA-- oh, yeah.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.200
 That dope for a VGA module with the VGA connector.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.760
 I think ADAC makes one too.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.240
 That's a damn good idea with like 13 CV.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:45.600
 Yeah.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.880
 That's one of the new ones, right?

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.880
 That's the super booth.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.240
 That's really an idea.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.120
 I only wish there was like a VGA connector

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.680
 on the side of this case so I could just hook up two cases

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.280
 and then have like a bust between them.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.600
 Oh, that'd be cool, yeah.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.000
 Yeah.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.200
 Can you give the rundown on that?

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.640
 Like I watched the Super booth reveal,

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.840
 but he didn't talk about some of the stuff

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.400
 that I wanted to hear him talk about, like,

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.800
 the performance mixer and shit.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800
 I guess we can talk about that later.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.760
 I was curious what the hell the connection thing was all about.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.640
 Yeah, it's just another way instead

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.640
 of having 13 long cables connecting two systems,

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.040
 just use the VGA cable instead.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.280
 Hook all the stuff you want to into these inputs or outputs

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.160
 and then when you connect the two VGA cable,

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.280
 you would need two modules, one in each system.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.960
 And then you would connect VGA between them

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.000
 and then all the connections would be together.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.520
 Like bridging those two systems, basically.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.160
 Okay, and how many connections can each one handle?

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.280
 13, I think total on the VGA cable.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.760
 So that his module has like 13 connectors

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.720
 and it's just like bidirectional at that point.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.840
 It's like a fancy molten.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.280
 So you wouldn't have to remember what goes where.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.080
 'Cause it's just like it'll line up.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.080
 Yep, just patch it into the modules as you want,

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.240
 connect the VGA cables.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.680
 All right, well that is pretty slick.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.600
 Yeah, that's okay.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.080
 'Cause I've been, you know,

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.800
 you know how it is writing down patch.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.640
 You know how it is.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.440
 Or like using this thing or like trying to write this.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:11.160
 Write down what this should be plus like a cell phone note

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.680
 and then like 40 minutes before a show starts

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.080
 try to repatch everything together.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.280
 Be like, oh yeah, it's right.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.480
 And how much HP is it for the module?

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.320
 I think it was eight.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.200
 It might have been a little more.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.360
 Probably a little more in other things.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.720
 Probably worth it though.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.720
 Yeah, I mean, I know last time I performed live

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.120
 with more than one case, I totally fucked up my patch.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.120
 And I had to like just kind of wing it, you know what I mean?

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.560
 Like repatch something on the fly

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.360
 and it did not end up how I had it, you know,

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.360
 in practice session.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.560
 But yeah, that caught my eye.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.240
 They're dope for announce a bunch of shit.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.480
 Yeah, it was a performance mixers.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.480
 Yeah, I mean, he had like a lot of interesting stuff

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.240
 with the thing that really caught my eye was performance mixers.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.640
 Unfortunately, the video, Super booth video

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.880
 didn't really touch upon that much.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.720
 But.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.880
 And that was, they were really announcing

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.440
 the voltage controlled one.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.040
 'Cause they had like two other versions

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.040
 of the regular non-voltage controlled performance mixer

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.200
 that they've changed over the years.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.040
 Like putting the return on it.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.440
 The A1 that it's huge.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.320
 Yep, the P and the O, right?

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.720
 Yeah.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.240
 The P is the actual, I think performance mixer

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.040
 and the O is the output.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.840
 The output is still the same.

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.160
 These new ones still connect up to that for their output.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.560
 But the mixer itself is different now.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.840
 I see.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.680
 Because it has all the voltage control,

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.680
 compatibility.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.200
 It also has a shit ton of LEDs now.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.920
 But it's still basically that four channel mixer.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.280
 With the knobs, like the Dopurnobs.

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.440
 I mean, if you looked at it, it looks the same

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.120
 except you'll see more LEDs on it.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.840
 The new one is the A135 something.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.240
 And the older ones, the A138.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:57.520
 It adds the LEDs because you kind of need them

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.400
 if you're gonna utilize the expansions.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.440
 So you can see where it's at.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.440
 The one expansion offers CV control over everything.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.320
 The volume, the panning, the aux send.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.680
 It's four different parameters

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.080
 that you have voltage control over for each channel.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.720
 And it's just a separate expansion.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.320
 And then they also have another expansion.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.880
 It's a quad envelope follower.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.200
 So that essentially, you can generate voltages

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.640
 from your four inputs on the mixer,

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.760
 have them routed to the control voltage expansion

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.160
 and control other channels.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:37.080
 So you can do ducking, pseudo compression, hand control.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.160
 Yeah, the side chain basically, things of that nature.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.440
 And there's also still dedicated outputs.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.680
 So you can route those elsewhere in your rig too,

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.840
 the envelopes that are generated from that.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.200
 So if you had all these expansions

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.720
 and one of these mixers,

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.040
 how much space would it end up taking?

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.080
 A good grip in space.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.320
 It's not the most compact setup.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.320
 You know, it's affordable though.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.160
 The price is real good.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.400
 Dude, it's like, it's probably like half the price, I think.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.240
 Oh, that's awesome.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.800
 With all the expansions, then say like the WMD one.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.640
 Oh yeah.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.760
 I mean, the WMD is more channels too.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.600
 You know what I mean?

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.680
 It's apples and oranges, I guess.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.640
 It just depends on what you need.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.480
 Personally, I don't need that many channels

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.680
 that the WMD offers.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.800
 So like the Dober one's really appealing to me,

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.480
 especially with all the expansions.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.480
 It's four channels, but you also have four channels,

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.680
 CB control over the parameter.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.960
 You're envelope followers and that all gets

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.720
 outputted to the old A138.0.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.560
 Okay.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.240
 So you get two outs, you're left right,

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.680
 depending on how you have it panned

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.960
 and your aux send and return, which is cool.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.240
 Yeah, that's always cool too

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.640
 because you can use, those channels are VCA's too.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.040
 So you don't need a VCA and you can just have it there

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.840
 on the mixer, which is pretty sweet.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.440
 (upbeat music)

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.020
 (upbeat music)

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.620
 (upbeat music)

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:38.120
 I just love his name.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.400
 It's like a character out of "Frag a Rock" or something.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.880
 (laughing)

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.480
 Uncle traveling, "Deter Doper."
