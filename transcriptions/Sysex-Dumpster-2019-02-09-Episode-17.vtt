00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.400
 [Music]

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.400
 We're good. Are we recording? We are recording into an ER 301 this time.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.400
 That's very exciting. We've talked about the 301 at length in the past.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400
 Yeah.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.400
 Now we're seeing it in action. It's recording right to a mini SD card or micro or whatever the hell.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.400
 Looks like it's doing a good job. We only have six hours and eleven minutes at a time, so we gotta be quick.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.400
 So, what was our last time recorded? Was January? Did we do one this year?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 We put something out in January, but I think the recording was...

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.400
 No, it might have been January. I don't either. Time is an old illusion.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.400
 It's a flat circle.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 [Laughter]

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.400
 You don't watch.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.400
 I just did, so it's like crushing my brain. So good.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.400
 I think it was following... Shit, I don't know.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 I don't remember. It was our Sweet 16 episode. That's all I remember.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 I can look it up. If only we had a device connected the World Wide Web.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 Yeah, those are our information. Superhighway.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.400
 Let's see if you've gone back to the quad LFO on your ornament and crime.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.400
 Yep. Yeah. I was super into sequence after you got me into it just in that one day, and then this guy upset it.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.400
 And also I had to take my MFB Dual LFO out, which I'm still... I didn't want to take it out.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 That's a bummer.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.400
 Yeah, so this is doing LFO duty right now because I can't give up the O&C.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.400
 I had a question about that.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 One of us in crime, basic firmware, does include first generator.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400
 I saw that the attempt utils does.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 Yeah, the attempt utils does.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 Well, it just did me hardware.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
 Yeah. You can't run those.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.400
 It just does a good...

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.400
 I was thinking about getting one of those.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400
 I've always wanted to get one.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.400
 It looks like a nice clocking and weird gate trigger device for sure.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.400
 But there's no demos out there.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.400
 And I'm curious how it works.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.400
 It looks great on paper, but I don't like to see every mode in detail how it can be modulated and how effective it is.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.400
 Because burst generation is a little weird.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400
 Yep.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.400
 You know what I mean? It gets a little wonky there, and I want it to be tight.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.400
 If it's sloppy, I have no need for it.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.400
 How's that 2HP burst? I saw you just got that.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.400
 For the price and size, it's a nice utility, but it's a little sloppy as well.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.400
 When you're saying sloppy, it would precisely do me about that.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.400
 I want to dial in specific intervals with the burst and modulated very tightly.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.400
 It's got to be tight with the rest of the beat.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.400
 Sometimes it feels like it's a little drifty.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400
 It's not locked in as tight as it could be.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.400
 And that's the problem with gauge generation.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 It can't go forward in time.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.400
 You know what I mean? So it's going to be a little offset.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.400
 I figured TEMSEY TILL, it's all digital, might be really close to what I'm looking for.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.400
 I would also check out Hemispheres, because that has a ton of stuff.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.400
 I didn't know with Hemispheres on this, you can turn this into a quad midi to CV converter.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.400
 Because somebody was asking, they wanted to do something poly, and someone was like,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.400
 "Oh, just run this on your ornament or crime."

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.400
 There's a lot of stuff in Hemispheres that I didn't know about.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400
 So it might have some clocking thing.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.400
 I knew they have logic in there, some type of sequence thing.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.400
 I need to give that a more proper look.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.400
 The only problem I use the default firmware all the time.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.400
 The only time I can see myself using Hemispheres is if I got another ornament in crime.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.400
 I don't want to give what I have about it.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.400
 It's in every patch.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.400
 It's either this liquid sequence or the acid curls.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400
 I've been using a lot of.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400
 I didn't see the sequence.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.400
 I thought the editing, I was like, "I don't want to put in a sequence with those two knobs."

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.400
 But it's so easy.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.400
 It's actually really fast.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.400
 It's just as good as almost any other sequencer.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.400
 It does crazy stuff, because you can have the two sequences kind of affect each other.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 That's when it gets kind of bananas.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 They have their own independent either clock or gate.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.400
 Then you can get this weird ship between the two of them as they're affecting one another.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.400
 They're not necessarily in time or the way they're affecting each other is not in time.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.400
 They finally give that a shot.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.400
 Speaking of sequencers, I can kick it off with Bad Boy in front of me here.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.400
 I have 12 vector sequencer, which I got yesterday in the mail.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 Much like the sequins, it has its own independent clocking.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.400
 You can have different multipliers for each track, which is amazing.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.400
 Not just a vision.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.400
 Not just a vision.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400
 You can have division and multiplication.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 The best thing.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.400
 I like that.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.400
 These two mod inputs right here.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.400
 You can CV start position on a sequence.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 You can CV the length of a sequence.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 You can CV the multiplier.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.400
 You can CV the rate that things start happening.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.400
 I don't even know all the things you can CV in here yet, because I'm just one day in.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.400
 It was kind of the key thing that sold me over.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.400
 I want something where I can CV the sequence, because nothing I have really does that.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.400
 The Metac Digitallis does it, too, to agree.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.400
 That's a nice thing.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.400
 This kind of blows it way out.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:40.400
 You can even CV the groove of the steps, the micro positioning and stuff, which Electron has never done that.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.400
 I've always won that feature.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:51.400
 That's why I like the audio damage sequencer one for so long, because it has the CV outs that you can route back into itself and CV certain functions.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.400
 I love the whole feature set of it.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.400
 Other than that, it wasn't a great sequence, but I really dug that element of it.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.400
 I don't have the expander that comes with it.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.400
 The expander is like 14 HP or something like that, and it's DIN MIDI in and out.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.400
 Another set, because this is actually...

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.400
 Does it give you more CV ins?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400
 E-TAN, sure.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400
 T-T.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.400
 T-R-S MIDI out of the hood.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.400
 Yeah, it gives you more trigger ins, more CV ins.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.400
 You get like 12 trigger ins and outs.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.400
 The cool thing is each one is an in or an out, depending on how you have it configured.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.400
 Those can affect other sequences.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400
 They can step through other sequences.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:34.400
 Basically, everything with this, you've got to clock it from either USB or the run clock reset CV inputs.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:44.400
 The expander is the only way you get a MIDI input, which I thought these MIDI outs were also inputs, but they're not, which is fine.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.400
 One of the cons, I love this thing.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.400
 I'm super invested in it.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:55.400
 I don't know, he's going to nail it, but right now I've run into three straight up firmware crashes, where it's like, ooh, error message on the top of the screen.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.400
 He's aware of some of them already.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:04.400
 He seems super responsive on the board, but there's certain stuff like, if you're going to know part here, this is where you mute and unmute stuff.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.400
 I'm sorry listeners, you can't really see this, that would be pretty cool.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:16.400
 But if you hold down muted, it'll mute it and unmute the part, but if a gate is on or off, sometimes it'll get stuck and I've run into stuff where it's like, oh, this is just the thing.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.400
 Oh, this is just like, nothing's playing.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.400
 Right, right.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.400
 Play anything.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400
 I thought it was broken.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.400
 It's just like a known bug right now.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.400
 So I have the MIDI box too and a pyramid.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.400
 This doesn't invalidate any other sequencer I have.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:42.400
 I still think the pyramid is kind of like my top of the heap, but the cool thing about this and the way it compares to the MIDI box is you have all these like presets up at the top that take you to the stuff that were kind of deeper in layers on the MIDI box.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.400
 You've got pitch, you can select your pitches, you can hit shift and it moves it up by an octave, all that shit you would expect.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.400
 Gate and groove.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:57.400
 So you can change the gate time or tie them or go into this other menu, move the steps back and forth, which is just right there.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.400
 That's like a whole set of steps on other sequencers.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.400
 Velocity, you just get like velocity curves, CCs for everything.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:16.400
 It sends MIDI and CV in and out.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400
 This is the weird one.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400
 So length and repeat.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.400
 So this is step length, right, which is different than gate length.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.400
 But if you make this to a two, your sequence is now 17 steps long.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.400
 It's going to chill on this for two steps, which is weird.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.400
 Like I still don't even know how I would use that in a piece of music yet.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.400
 That's the way like Metropolis is.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:41.400
 We're adjusting the length of each step, not gate length, but like step repeat.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.400
 Exactly.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.400
 So you could do some weird like shit, I forget what the Metropolis is based off of.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.400
 Oh, the old Roland one.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.400
 Yeah.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.400
 So I guess you could get some type of like weird stuff like that.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.400
 But I've never had a sequence that does this, so I'm like, I need to wrap my head around.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.400
 Can you CV that parameter?

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.400
 I think so.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.400
 I'm still learning.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.400
 It's actually like you can learn the basic functionality of the sequence around like an hour.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.400
 It's pretty easy.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.400
 You're like, oh, hit chance.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.400
 What's that do?

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:20.400
 Oh, you can set chance for all of these different layers here and pick the type of thing and say like, I want to set ratchet or ratchet percentage on each step.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.400
 Oh modulation.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.400
 I think this is where it's at.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.400
 You got sub sequences.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:35.400
 So each variable step sequence, which goes up to 64 steps, you get an eight step fixed sequence that's always just running alongside of it at whatever rate you want to pick.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.400
 So how do you specify what is it just repeating the same step or like, what do you mean?

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400
 Yeah, you can have it.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.400
 You can modulate this, I believe and say modulation external.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.400
 Oh, here it is.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:54.400
 I want to target gate lengths, start position, ratchet amounts, probability amount, start point length, direction of the sequence.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400
 It's fucking nuts.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400
 And then the amount for each one of these.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.400
 That's beautiful.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.400
 Yeah, it's got like, here's where you set like a landy.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400
 It's handy.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.400
 It's a nice thing there.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:11.400
 You know, it's black and white LEDs LCD screen, like we were saying, it's the same as the ER 301, but just not the colored lens on top.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.400
 I love how the modes that I'm watching you shift through are color coded.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.400
 Yeah, because I do that a lot with gear.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.400
 I color code shit, you know what I mean?

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.400
 So you can just set for each track what you want the background LED and the steps.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.400
 See, notice how this is kind of weird.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.400
 Like, I think this is a bug where you can't change the background one, but it'll change depending on some of the settings.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.400
 So I know he'll get that nailed down.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.400
 But yeah, it's like the UI is straightforward.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.400
 He spent a couple of years now working on this thing and I feel like he's fucking close.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.400
 Like it's not like some far off thing.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.400
 He's going to nail it pretty soon.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.400
 So you've kind of gotten in bed with like another like other person's crazy life project.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400
 Yes.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.400
 Once again.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.400
 If any listeners have a crazy life project, they want someone to become heavily invested in.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.400
 Hit up neck.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.400
 This is like, I'm kind of fucked up in the head and I can't stop myself from doing this.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.400
 There's another one I'm going to get fucking model samples to, which I'll talk about.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.400
 And I just saw someone today was like, yeah, I can crash this thing.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.400
 Fuckin' sequence or disease, man.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.400
 But yeah, overall, like, pitches are great.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.400
 Like, everything's been solid that works.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.400
 I've had a few crashes, but I've also been getting like just sequences that I haven't gotten under by the gear.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.400
 It's a joy to use.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.400
 To be honest, you can do like, I don't know who knows where he's going to take it.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.400
 You get a lot of reset options too.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.400
 You can have it automatically reset at the end.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.400
 Like reset every three beats, every four beats.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.400
 So how many tracks in total is it there?

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.400
 It's eight tracks.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.400
 Yeah, you get eight parts.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.400
 And is each part color coded then?

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.400
 You can change the color coding for each part of each.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.400
 Okay, I get it.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.400
 And then you get like presets for each part.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.400
 So that's really your sequences are like a preset.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:01.400
 So this part will be like, I'm going to always send out of MIDI channel 3 out of MIDI output 2 or something like that.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.400
 Or CV output, you know, CV pair, this pair.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:11.400
 And it'll just kind of hold that and then you can change a preset and that's just a different set of sequences and multipliers and all that.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.400
 So how do you save and load in this?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.400
 Oh, good question.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.400
 So one thing is you see that little disk there.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.400
 It's always saving some things, I think.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.400
 But if you hit shift and save, it's just save project.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.400
 And at first I was like, what are all these little lines?

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.400
 Oh, they just correspond to these numbers.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.400
 So you can edit them real quick, hit save.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:36.400
 And there's actually an SD card, another SD card in this system behind it that's saving everything.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.400
 And this USB plug, you plug it in and it's just like a disk drive on your computer.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.400
 So you can back up everything.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:51.400
 And this is USB host, which actually did, I tried it yesterday, you can plug, I have that a CHI LPK25 plug it in and you can record right away.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.400
 Which brings me to another one of the cons.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.400
 So this doesn't do real time recording right now.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:02.400
 Even though you think, what the fuck, it records from the MIDI inputs, but it's just like SH101 style.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.400
 Where it's like picking the notes and it's going to move you to the next note.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.400
 So it's not like, I kind of need it to be real time eventually.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.400
 Because the pyramid I'm used to like, I'm going to make the sequence quantize it and I'm fucking done.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.400
 I don't have much mental time that I want to spend doing step recording.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.400
 That's not how I work.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.400
 Unless I'm like doing a 101 style thing.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.400
 So that's something that needs to be improved.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.400
 I thought it had it built in.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.400
 Oh, and you can also do this shit too.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.400
 So down here you get shift and you can just generate a new sequence, generate a new sequence.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.400
 Or you can pick all these rules to evolve the existing sequence.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.400
 And you see how it's just moving certain things.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.400
 You can set the percentage that you want it to evolve a pattern and then dupe those out to other things.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.400
 Which is like super fucking exciting.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.400
 So wait, are you going through major and minor chords?

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.400
 Like how is it determining what the next note is going to be?

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.400
 Good question.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.400
 You can send chords out of this.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.400
 There's a chord part, but I think if I can find it.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.400
 Looks like you've gotten pretty deep in the day, man.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.400
 Yeah, you're bouncing around it like no problem.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.400
 It's been an it's been in some time on it for sure.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.400
 But what the fuck is that?

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.400
 But yeah, you can set the amount that you want it to evolve in certain rules that you want it to kind of obey.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.400
 Yeah, there's all these shift functions.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.400
 Like you can really quickly to just like shift a sequence back and forth in time.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.400
 Oh, which is nice.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.400
 Yeah.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.400
 The ratcheting shift is really cool.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.400
 That's fun.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.400
 You only you could just get like ratchet number per step.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.400
 Yeah, it's like I'm super impressed.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.400
 Even with some crashes like normally.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.400
 I would probably sell like something that crashes now unless someone was like, yeah, this is really beta,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.400
 but I'll persist with this until he gets it working.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.400
 I'm sold.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400
 We met him at NomCon.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.400
 Yeah, Jim Coker.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.400
 Yeah, real cool dude.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.400
 He gave me a great demo of it at NomCon and that's part of what kind of sold me on it.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.400
 And eventually this will load numerology sequences.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.400
 Jim, he makes numerology the software too.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.400
 So shit, if that eventually happens, I would have a Mac now.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.400
 I never used to have a Mac so I would try numerology.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.400
 Hell, I don't know.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:09.400
 Looks like all the best features of some of my favorite Euro sequencers all packed into one with more tracks and more functionality.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400
 Totally.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.400
 And I think he nailed it from that perspective because I know I've been on his website and for him now a good bit.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.400
 And you can see two years ago someone was like, oh, check out the pyramid.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.400
 And he was like, so these are the features you want, huh?

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.400
 And they're like all in here.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400
 Nice.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:31.400
 I never expected to see like a Euro rack sequencer become as powerful as like an external one, you know what I mean?

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.400
 Or be like the heart of any setup.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.400
 Like they always just seem like they're designed to be auxiliary sequencers, you know what I mean?

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.400
 Or to just handle one part in your setup.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.400
 But this thing looks like it can handle a lot.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:48.400
 I'm thinking and I think with the expander and this, I think it might fit in the biggest 4ms pod.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.400
 It's not too deep for the 4ms pods.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.400
 No, it's really flat.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.400
 It's like one board behind it.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.400
 I don't know.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.400
 And he has such experience.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.400
 Like he's been working on numerology for like 20 years now.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.400
 Like I don't have any doubt that he's going to finish this out.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400
 So you have any help?

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400
 Which is all him.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.400
 Good question.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.400
 I don't know.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.400
 He's the one who really responds to everything but he kind of refers to like the team, the fuck you all team.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.400
 Okay.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.400
 I know he's like building these himself.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.400
 I don't think it's not like ticking clock.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.400
 Oh, have yours ready in the beginning of February like two months ago.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.400
 Like this, at that Monday, the first week of February, he's like, I'm going to ship this and you'll have it when.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.400
 I don't know though.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:29.400
 I mean, we're all all three of us are cat people and we probably have referred to sitting upstairs with a cat as the team.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400
 So it is possible.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400
 It's just him.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.400
 So yeah, vector sequencer.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.400
 Definitely worth checking out.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.400
 Yeah.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.400
 Super into it.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.400
 I'm also wondering how many people this might be the first time they're even hearing about it because this does kind of seem like it's under the radar.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.400
 Yeah.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.400
 There may be like 20 of these out right now.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.400
 Yeah.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.400
 I think.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.400
 Are they like available now or are the ones that are out in the wild now?

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.400
 They've been on like pre-order forever.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.400
 It's just doing them in small batches.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.400
 It's been low key.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.400
 Like you've got to email him and then he'll say, oh, you want one?

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.400
 Like, pay right now and then I'll give you your date.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.400
 And that's how it worked.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.400
 I'm like, sending the money.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.400
 And you said, all right, you're top of February because I waited for a little.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.400
 I was like on the fence and I saw some video.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.400
 Fucking I'm doing it.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.400
 That's how that tacky ons.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.400
 I don't think I got was.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.400
 You emailed him.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.400
 He's like, I got there's four or five people in front of you.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.400
 You're on the list.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.400
 You're after that.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.400
 And it'll be.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.400
 I'm not going to give you a date.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.400
 Like it was that level of just like, we'll get to it, dude.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.400
 I'm like, that's cool.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.400
 I can get behind that.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:50.400
 I'm going to let somebody else once we go, I'll start it off with this.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.400
 So model samples, the new electron device.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:00.400
 I've high hopes in some ways because I think it might be like just all the shit I want

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:05.400
 from an electron device pulled out into new menu screen.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.400
 I like the rhythm a lot.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.400
 I find that I don't use the scene functionality or the performance pads as much as I used to.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.400
 Maybe that's just a habit that I've got to break.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:19.400
 So that may be the case, but model samples is more expensive than it should be for sure.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.400
 I think it's like four ten or something like that retail.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.400
 So it's comparing with the new electrabs, I feel.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.400
 Those new electrabs, which can do more on the surface.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.400
 But I almost hope that electron starts to make some more devices that are not neutered

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:41.400
 and stripped down, but are a little flatter and not as much like hierarchy and depth for certain things.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.400
 Because I've seen some videos of people using them.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.400
 What kind of sold me was how fast you can change.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:53.400
 Starting endpoints on a sample are radically changed the sound without having to page over.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.400
 I'm going to go to the effects now.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.400
 And it seems like the control all functionality that used to be on the machine drum,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.400
 hold down one knob and affect everything.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.400
 Now it's like, oh, that makes perfect sense on this setup.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.400
 I'm going to filter all the drums down.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.400
 I'm going to pitch everything on here down or change the end point so that everything gets really short.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.400
 And I can kind of get down with that.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.400
 It's also got, I don't know if I'll explain this well.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:22.400
 So on the rhythm, you have start and then length as your second parameter on a sample,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.400
 which is different than start and end point.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.400
 There are certain effects like the digitact does start and end point.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.400
 So if you want to do that kind of like, I like this idea, I mean like,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.400
 repeat a note really quick and then change the length so it kind of stretches out.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.400
 On the rhythm, it doesn't quite hit the end of the sample quite the same way.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.400
 And on the digitact and on, apparently the model sample is, it just kind of does it the way it does.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.400
 And I think it's simpler and able to, which is like where I've used that trick a lot.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.400
 So I'm kind of looking forward to that.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.400
 I hope that it's something that they just kind of fucking nail and they don't have to update it.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.400
 But then yesterday it was like some dude working through it and he just hit like the play button again

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.400
 and the whole thing just locked up and you couldn't even hit the power button and turn it down.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.400
 Nice.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400
 Oh, okay.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.400
 Yeah, that's always scary to see.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.400
 Granted, you know, nobody has it yet.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.400
 The only people that have it are just beta testers right now.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.400
 But I'm hopeful for it.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.400
 I hope that I like it enough that it's like, oh no, I want to keep using this thing.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.400
 So we'll see.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.400
 I'm going to give it a shot because I'm super intrigued by the simplicity of it.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.400
 And it's like the stuff from them that I like.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.400
 It could be a total lemon though.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.400
 When I saw the feature said, I want to like it, you know, but it's from Electron.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.400
 So I'm kind of like, I don't want to like it.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:43.400
 I know it's going to be, you know, expensive and probably limited, you know, in the ways

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:48.400
 where I don't want it to be limited and then like overly complicated where I don't need

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.400
 it to be like, that's just my electron experience with everything aside from the fucking machine

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.400
 drum.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400
 So I don't know.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.400
 It does look like there's nothing, nothing complicated about this.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.400
 Yeah.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400
 The screens even been simplified.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.400
 Like there's like two arguments and some text.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.400
 And even the Digitech still has a learning curve to get into like the electron way of

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:14.400
 doing things where this is a big step away from like the electron way of doing things.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.400
 Yeah.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.400
 It should be like, and I've seen people say like, oh, if you know an electron piece of gear,

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.400
 you're going to be like a half hour in your good kind of thing.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.400
 We'll see.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400
 Yeah.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.400
 I mean, I watched a couple of videos that did remind me a bit of like the machine drum

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.400
 more so than the Digitech did.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:36.000
 So like I guess if this format is successful, we could probably see a future drum machine

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 coming.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 I would hope.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 Yeah.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.600
 Well, it might have been you who said the idea that this might just be the first of a new

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.600
 model series.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.600
 Right.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600
 I would think so.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.600
 If they're going to use the colon and everything.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.600
 Yeah.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.600
 It's weird unless you're going to make model FM next or something, which I mean, that is

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.600
 the pattern, but they did just make it bigy tone.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.600
 Yeah.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.600
 Well, they just made the Digitech.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.600
 Yeah.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.960
 I think this is just like a more flat, laid out version of that, you know.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.200
 And that's what's pissing people off because there's still like digitech issues that are

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.000
 being worked on over bridges been worked on for two and a half years now.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.200
 I've never four or five.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.300
 So people are like, oh, you're going to work on a new product?

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:20.240
 It's, you know, the thing that kind of annoyed me right off the bat was I saw that they implemented

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.240
 track multiplication.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.400
 Yes, they did.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.200
 And that's still not in the Digitech.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.600
 I'm like, are you kidding me?

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.200
 And we the Octatrack and the model samples can do it.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.200
 Yeah.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.800
 They get, they're frustrating in that way.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.720
 Like, and it's, this one has velocity sensitive pads, but none of the, you know, they're always

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.200
 like mixing features around and it's kind of frustrating.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.600
 It's like, haven't you learned?

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.120
 Like, don't you just want to nail it?

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.520
 Even the Digitech does a step back and now the model samples is like a step back from

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.520
 that.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.520
 Yeah.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.520
 Yeah.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.520
 I don't know.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.520
 Strange.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.520
 Yeah.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.520
 You better programmers.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.240
 I mean, it doesn't seem like, you know, it's a programming issue because they solve it

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.760
 on one machine, I refuse to believe that that can't, those algorithms, those ideas can't

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.880
 be ported then to other things.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.080
 And I'm not going to be convinced that isn't anything other than a conscious decision not

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.960
 to share this functionality across the things.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.960
 I'd have to agree.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.960
 Yeah.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.960
 I mean, they have the space in there, right?

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.920
 Like they could have designed it in.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.160
 It's not impossible.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.200
 They made one of those as like a little mini mono machine.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.560
 I would probably jump on it more so that would be cool than any other, you know, machine.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560
 Yeah, that's the next one.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.560
 That'd be sweet.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.560
 People have been asking for it forever.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.560
 Mm-hmm.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.560
 I was tempted by the Digitone.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.080
 I was like, well, this could kind of be like a part of a mono machine.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.440
 But then I was like, I don't know.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.840
 See people loving that thing.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.720
 I've seen so much praise for that thing, almost so much that it's like, oh, I'm never

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.280
 going to touch this thing because everybody's on that shit.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280
 Yeah.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.520
 But not that there's sounds in that, of course.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.280
 You know, generally my experience with FM programming is like you're 90% garbage most of

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.200
 the time and then you hit the 10% and you're like, oh, okay.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.600
 And then you're always on the cusp of calamity.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.600
 Yeah.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.840
 That's always, that's what's really exciting to me about FM and working with it.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.160
 I feel like maybe they've come up with something where those mistakes are either impossible

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:12.360
 or less likely and a lot of people are gravitating towards it because it may have a lot or no

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.480
 sort of like bad FM scenarios.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:21.000
 If it had more tracks and a more functional sequencer, I would grab a Digitone in a second

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.280
 just as an FM drum machine, you know what I mean?

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.720
 Like that was some of my favorite machines in machine drum was the FM.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720
 Yeah.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.720
 No doubts.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.720
 And same with model machine.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:36.200
 And there really isn't a real good FM drum box out there right now or a groove box, I

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.200
 should say.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.200
 You know what I mean?

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.200
 There's DX 200.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.200
 Yeah.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.200
 And there's the Nord's.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:48.880
 So I feel like they could have nailed that niche market, you know, but I don't know.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.120
 It's just not there.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.960
 You know, maybe that's the next model would be model like FM drums or something.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.960
 I can see that.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.640
 I'd be into it maybe.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.640
 Yeah, maybe.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.000
 And more so than the sample.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.520
 I just feel like there's so much competition right now for little sampling devices and even

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:09.800
 big sampling devices where I don't really see what need this thing is feeling exactly.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.560
 But I don't know.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:17.840
 So some a lot of people planning on muffin also in gear slits about the model samples

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.400
 not being able to actually sample.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.560
 You actually can't record into it at all, which is kind of strange.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.920
 But I'm going to put it out there.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.840
 I don't think that would be a deal breaker for me.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.680
 I honestly don't sample into my digit tech all that often.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:36.280
 What I do is I record a lot of stuff into like into a DAW and then chop that up and

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.720
 then just load it on the digit.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.720
 Sure.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.120
 The actual real time sampling.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.040
 I've done it, but it's a lot easier to do.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.080
 Yeah, it's so much easier doing a DAW and just boom, just throw it on there.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.840
 And if that helped them cut some cost in hardware, I don't think that's a big deal.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.560
 I'm going to put that out there.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:59.160
 People are probably a little bit more okay with loading samples on than recording.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.480
 That's my speculation based on my own preference.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.880
 But I see where you're going with that correct.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880
 Yep.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880
 I have respectfully disagree.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.200
 I just wanted another reason to complain.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:35.360
 So you didn't see the Schwaeman quad attenuator.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.440
 That was on reverb, right?

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.440
 The Schwaeman.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.440
 From Schwaeman.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.360
 Active attenuators with bias switches for $2,500.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.360
 Oh, shit.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.920
 Like rare labels like rare.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.920
 You're never going to.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.920
 This is the same dude who like.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.920
 It's a fucking attenuator.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.920
 Yeah.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.840
 If I would have kept the VCO2RM that goes for like $1,500.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.760
 If I had to kept my MF2 dude, yeah.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.000
 I saw that's going for like over $2,000.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.880
 I was like, wow, wow, wow, wow.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.880
 I forgot you had.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.280
 For a brief time, yeah.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.200
 I liked it, but then I decided like I like the MF6 better.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.760
 So I like downgraded.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.840
 It was smaller achiever.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.880
 It just wasn't stereo, but it did the job and had great sound.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.200
 But that new filter they showed off.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.680
 Actually, is it even a filter?

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.880
 It's just like a saturation.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.640
 Oh, they have the new like mini synth.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.840
 No, no, no, no, no, voice.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.000
 This is something new.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 It was announced around NAMM.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.400
 I don't know if it was announced at NAMM, but it's like a--

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.080
 Shit, I wish I could pull it up.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.560
 I don't even know what to search for.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.240
 But essentially like a multi saturation circuit

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.720
 that's based off of the saturations from MF6 module

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.240
 and stuff.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:42.720
 Oh, shit.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.720
 Yeah, it's--

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.280
 They have create-- they have like an amp slash.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.240
 It's a quad multi-brand compressor and shit.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.840
 I think this is a quad as well.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.480
 It's like a quad saturation thing.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.720
 It's like-- Oh, it might be the big ass filter.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.600
 Like it's like four--

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.280
 Yeah, it's like four M and F6 is based.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:27:59.920
 It's what I'm--

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.760
 Law on.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.400
 Oh, OK.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.240
 All the time.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.440
 Like Surgeon's Lab said we had that thing in there.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.520
 He's like, yeah, I filter everything with this.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.440
 I would love that.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.080
 It's like unobtainium.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.080
 Yeah.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.640
 But this was like a newer version of it.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.680
 Like it's-- I think something that's like coming out.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.120
 Yeah, they've got a bunch of new stuff.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.760
 Like new Bastrum, BLD.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.120
 They've got a second version of that.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:20.960
 Saw that too, yeah.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.320
 It's coming out.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.040
 A few other things.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.120
 They've been busy for sure.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.600
 But it's just really hard to get it.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.640
 Because they make it all by hand.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.240
 They're like, we have no interest in doing like mass scale

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240
 version.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.040
 Any time I see anything, Swamin, now I just glance at it.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.200
 You know, I don't want the temptation.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.000
 You know, I'm just like, oh, yeah.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.880
 I'll just scan the features and be like, yep, I could use that.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.480
 But yeah.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.800
 I ain't going to look at it any further.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.720
 So it's slightly off talk, but not quite, I guess.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.320
 Autaker.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:52.920
 Yeah.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.760
 Releasing those live sets.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.280
 Oh, fuck.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.120
 A slew of them.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.840
 Like 19 different live sets on their website.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.280
 And truly different.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.760
 What they do, like there's a wide variety of stuff.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.040
 I've gotten through four of the tracks so far.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.840
 Yeah.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.200
 Yeah.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.240
 Every track has like enough variation warrant, like listening to,

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.960
 I guess it's not like 19 different, you know, versions

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.640
 of the same set, basically.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.400
 Yeah.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.840
 My favorite so far is the Miami set.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.840
 I feel like that was a really rock solid set from start to finish.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.400
 I don't have a lot of comment, mostly because I think everything

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.440
 they do is amazing.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.280
 So there's zero surprise.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.080
 It met my expectations and it's amazing.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:35.520
 Yeah.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.880
 I'm not like a huge fanboy of them.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.960
 Like some of their stuff I absolutely love and I have since, you know,

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.440
 the 90s and then there's other stuff which is completely like passable for me.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:45.800
 Yeah.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.240
 Like over the years, you know what I mean?

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.320
 Like, I don't know.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.840
 Like what, like what would be an example of something that didn't hit you?

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.720
 Honestly, the stuff that is more structured, I like less.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.880
 I like it when they get really experimental sounding, you know,

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.400
 when you get abstract, the stuff that sounds, and I know it's not truly

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.640
 generative because I've read, you know, the interviews and all that.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.720
 But the stuff that has that generative feel to it is always more interesting to me.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.640
 Like, you know what I mean?

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.160
 Like I get in a certain mode and I want to hear that type of stuff.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.480
 The stuff that is more like beat oriented.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.600
 I'm just, I don't know.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.480
 I feel like it's kind of boring because there's not enough elements to it.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.120
 You know what I mean?

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.680
 Yeah.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.600
 Does that make any sense?

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:26.800
 Yeah.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.720
 It's hard to explain.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.560
 I understand.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.480
 Yeah.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.360
 But yeah, that's my take on it.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:38.760
 And I feel like these live sets are some of, it's like a condensed version of the stuff

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.120
 that I do really enjoy from them.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:40.600
 You know what I mean?

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.640
 Like it's just a solid set from start to finish.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.800
 I feel like it translates better to my ears more so than some of the albums.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.760
 You know what I mean?

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.800
 Like it's just, it's top notch.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.640
 In my opinion.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:56.280
 The live sets I've seen from them and heard like it forces them to be a certain type of

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.600
 way that I think works well for what I want to hear.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:58.960
 Yeah.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:04.040
 Because some of the stuff like my complaints are generally like, oh, I feel just nothing

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.400
 from this, nothing at all.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:05.880
 Oh man.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.720
 It's like, I hear what you're doing.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.400
 I have no idea why I'd listened to this again.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.080
 After I listened to it, I can't even like remember anything.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.600
 And some of the stuff, it's like, oh no, that'll stick with me.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.680
 I can even remember certain parts of the live sets where it's like, fuck.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.760
 That was it.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:24.360
 So that's my, like sometimes I just feel like I am not feeling a thing from it.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.560
 And it's not like, I'm sure that they are.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.760
 It's just me reacting to it.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.280
 Oh.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.960
 I feel you.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.640
 And you've seen them live in person, right?

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.640
 Yeah, twice.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:33.880
 Nice.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.440
 First on the electron tour, which was great.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:42.960
 And then in DC, when they were right after two albums ago, when they were like Max MSP

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.760
 live set and that was the total head fuck.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:51.320
 Especially because they do like mandate, like turn off all the lights and it's like,

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.840
 it was super disoriented in this beautiful way because the time was just being dissolved

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.840
 pretty well.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.640
 I just wanted to mention that.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.400
 No, no, I'm not.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.400
 I got to dig into those.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.880
 I haven't really had this either.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.680
 Just some cursory scans.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.400
 NAMM 2019.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.400
 Yes.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:15.240
 I mean, notes are good, but I think one thing stands out above everything else that we don't

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.440
 need notes for.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.880
 It's just, it's in our heads, right?

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.080
 Everyone's excited about it.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.080
 It's really good.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.080
 It's really good.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.080
 It's really good.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.080
 I don't even know any of the differences.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.080
 It's open to years of anticipation and hype.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.080
 It's more than 30, isn't it?

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.080
 Probably.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.080
 It's probably like, I think Middie's as old as me.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:38.080
 I was going to say it's probably getting close to my age.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.040
 Yeah, I did take a couple notes of the differences.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:46.600
 It was really hard to decipher the differences of reading like the press release.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.320
 I just love the idea of the press release.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.320
 It was ridiculous.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.320
 But getting through that without cracking up.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320
 Oh, man.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.760
 I saw footage of like some of the people like chatting about it in a conference and like

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.600
 people were just losing their shit about it.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.320
 Like, he's like engineered dudes sitting in front like, you know, mouths open wide.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.400
 Like, wow, you know, like crying like they're watching the Beatles.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.400
 Yeah.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.760
 Some people are really excited about this, but I kind of want to talk to someone who's

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.400
 excited about this.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.760
 A couple of things worth mentioning.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.880
 It's fully backward compatible.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:27.400
 It's 32 bit with 16 bit velocity compared to Middie 1.0, which was 7 bit with some stuff

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.400
 that was 14 bit.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.680
 Yeah, the mod model or something.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.440
 And 16 groups of 16 channels.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:39.640
 I hope it's parallel processing and not like everything serial and current MIDI is not

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.640
 a great choice.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.640
 Yeah.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.640
 Not sure.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.120
 I didn't really have my head around MPE until just recently.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.480
 You know, the MPE, multi polyphonic expression or whatever.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.560
 So you know the micro freak.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.560
 Yeah.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.560
 Yeah.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.560
 Yeah.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.560
 The controller like this.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.280
 And that and you know, the rolly, see shit, whatever it is.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.720
 This stuff that looks like a fucking Geiger like keyboard that's all black latex or whatever.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.720
 Yeah.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.720
 Yeah.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.720
 So apparently you get like a control message for each note.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:11.760
 So it means that the synthesizer can react to a CC or control message for every single

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.760
 note you play.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.920
 I don't know what I would do with that.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.000
 But I can see like, oh cool, you get like expression or like you can change each notes

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 like LFO.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 Okay.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 But I don't like I still haven't seen that.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.200
 That's going to do something.

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.200
 Yeah.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.480
 Well, there's been like alternatives to Middie all over the place.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.720
 I mean, it's been like a work.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.720
 Yeah.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.720
 Oh, it's he was the one I was thinking of.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:39.240
 Um, and then there was other ones that are just like no matter how much they add to it.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:44.160
 In fact, it's so much fucking gear is MIDI compatible and is waiting for many signals.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.800
 Everyone's still going to be confined to MIDI because so much shit has it.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.640
 This seems like a huge fucking waste of time.

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.160
 That is literally polishing a chart because we've been working.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.160
 We've been working around this shit for 30 years already.

00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:00.440
 Like this thing has two MIDI outs just because like, yeah, and it solves the problem.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.680
 All my sequence is have like multiple MIDI outs because it can handle that shit.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.000
 I think a lot of it too.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.440
 It isn't just within gear, but within like computers, you know what I mean?

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.800
 Like a lot of video show.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.800
 OS's are considering MIDI like completely obsolete at this point and won't include.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.880
 So it's like we need a modernized standard.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.640
 I guess that in that regard, yeah.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.280
 Something that's not shit that can still handle your gear.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.280
 Sure.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.680
 The future doesn't leave it behind.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.960
 I don't know.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.720
 I'm refusing to take this seriously.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.400
 Like USB MIDI is like the shittiest thing in the fucking world.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.400
 It's pretty bad.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.400
 Yeah.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.480
 It's a bad stack speckled up of another shittier speck.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.480
 Yeah.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.480
 They're all different.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.640
 And the, um, as far as like gear that has both, invariably, that's what fucks up.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.640
 Yeah.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.640
 I never use it.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.640
 I never use it.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.640
 I know.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.840
 I'm updating my erica drum sequencer a couple of weeks ago via MIDI was a lot of fun.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.680
 A lot of fun.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.480
 It's like, wait over MIDI.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.480
 Yeah.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.120
 And you have to turn the buffer right way the hell down in the software.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.280
 So how long did it take?

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.200
 It took a shit, I don't even know, like 30 minutes and it failed.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.640
 So I had to do it again.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.520
 And then it, then it took and it bricked it because apparently if one thing goes wrong,

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.440
 it just shits itself.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.880
 Like there was a lot of people reporting the same problem on the forum.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.320
 So I'm glad to know I wasn't alone because I thought I did something wrong or something.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.440
 But no, it's just, it's flaky.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.920
 And if, if it takes the update, you have to wait, you can't like stop it in the middle

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.920
 of it.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.920
 You have to wait for it.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.920
 Yeah.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.240
 And then you can't do anything with the sequence or other than tell it to update again.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.240
 Like that's it.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.680
 You just got to hit the key combo and it'll go back into like waiting for SisX dump mode

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.480
 and you try again and you wait 30 minutes and hope that it works.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.360
 So yeah, it took me about two hours from start to finish to get the damn thing updated.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.000
 But I didn't know that going into it here.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.160
 I thought there was a USB port like in the back of the module or something.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.960
 I was like, surely I'll just plug this in.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.960
 Yeah.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.960
 Nope.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.360
 I got to use the MIDI all the way.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.360
 It's like, okay.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.600
 It's another beautiful thing about the 301 is that just put a zip file on the fucking SD

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.600
 card.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.600
 You don't even need to expand it.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.840
 It's going to deal with the zip file.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.840
 Yeah.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.520
 It'll like let you choose which version you can reboot it right there.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.080
 The sequence or one was the same deal.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.280
 Like, yeah, it was a SD card.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.680
 You just dropped the firmware into it, put the card back in the module, boot it up.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.640
 It would see it, load it, boom.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.640
 Like done.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.280
 Or you could put an entire MIDI stack on your device just to accept updates.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.280
 Yeah.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.680
 I'm all about that mutable audio update.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680
 Yeah.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.680
 That's fucking sweet.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.680
 I like that.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.680
 It's some weird black magic that I don't understand.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.680
 I just like doing it.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.680
 And it always says, you know, make sure you don't listen to it on speakers because it'll

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.680
 blow your shit out.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.680
 But of course I of course.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.680
 Of course.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.600
 I'm like, it's like listening to a modem, you know.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.600
 Yeah.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.600
 You just hear data.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.600
 It's like, wow.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.440
 And they didn't even take that long to dial it in because they're like, you know, it's

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.480
 going to take you a minute to like get the right levels of the output to make sure that

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.480
 it's reading it correctly.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.520
 Oh my God, it's going to be a nightmare.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.960
 Second try, third try.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.920
 It was super fucking easy.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.160
 Like everything should fucking move to this.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.800
 That reminds me of something.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.960
 I just popped back in my head.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.720
 Did you guys watch band or snatch?

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.720
 No.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.720
 No, no, no.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.720
 All right.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.720
 And I can't talk about it.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.720
 Also, our listeners might have not watched it yet either.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:20.120
 Well, this isn't like a spoiler.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.400
 But the ending is.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.640
 But it does happen at the end of one of the sounds like a spoiler.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:32.320
 There's an audio sound that goes on for several seconds that is like an update sound.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:37.560
 And I think I don't know how you would record it or what it's supposed to be, but I think

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.520
 it's a game that you can fucking like download through sound.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.160
 Oh, because there was some and I never I haven't looked into it yet, but I was like, I heard

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.080
 it like it was like at the end credits and I was like, Oh, I know that sound.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.080
 It was like, what the hell?

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.080
 What is this?

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.560
 You know, like I'm like to look into it and I haven't.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:59.160
 But because people have done that before, like the eight bit construction set, the B side

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.800
 of that or the A side or that was a Commodore program encoded.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800
 Okay.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.840
 And it's on the right track and assuming it's like a Commodore game then or something.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.840
 It could be.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.840
 Yeah.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.920
 Because that was because all they used audio tape as one of the drive formats.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.920
 That's pretty cool.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.920
 Yeah.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.520
 One of the endings apparently has some sort of Easter egg embedded in the audio and I just

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.840
 haven't had a chance to look into it, but I got pretty excited when I heard it.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.200
 I mean, there's no chance that there's like a Reddit form about this.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.200
 No one's talking about it at all.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.200
 That's the thing.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.200
 I'm sure somebody has heard.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.840
 It's definitely been founded before me, but I just haven't had a chance to dig into

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.520
 it, but I just thought that was nifty.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.520
 Oh, wait.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.520
 Do we want to talk more about Nam?

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.520
 Yeah.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.240
 And you briefly mentioned the micro freak.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.120
 Do we want to tap into that?

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.080
 I mean, do we want to do we want to go hard and I mean, I don't know if I'm going to

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.080
 have super positive things to say.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.560
 Let's tackle it this way.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.320
 They were two synthesizers that both have mutable oscillator code in them that were

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.320
 in Nam.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.320
 True.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.240
 Both relatively interesting and both approached that in very different ways, which is part

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.760
 of the controversy with the micro freak because they said it was a collaboration and that

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.880
 kind of pissed Olivier off.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880
 Is their name still?

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.880
 Emileena.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.880
 Emileena.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.880
 That's right.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.880
 Thank you.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.880
 That pissed Emily off.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.560
 Do you understand because that wasn't how it went down and they called them and apparently

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.440
 apologized and now everything's cool.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.640
 But okay.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:24.560
 So if Emily had not made a stink about this or heard it brought it up or pushed back on

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.840
 it, they were willing to go out there and basically lie or exaggerate.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:35.960
 And only after called out, did they rescind or make an apology or basically anything other

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.240
 than continue with this claim.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.400
 That's a bad look.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:45.080
 It shouldn't have had to come to the point where Emily had to say you're lying.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.760
 This isn't what actually happened.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.760
 Yeah.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.120
 It's shady marketing that pisses everybody off right there.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.120
 Yes.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.120
 Like, oh, you went over the top.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.120
 Just been real about it.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.080
 Say like, will you some of the oscillator code from bots?

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.080
 Fucking done deal.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.080
 Yeah.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.920
 She didn't even make a stink about it really.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.760
 Like, people were asking her, you know what I mean?

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.760
 Like, publicly on.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.760
 Okay.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.760
 That's really strong then.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.760
 Yeah.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.760
 Yeah.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.560
 She just said they had like zero contact with me.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:14.560
 There she said like I had zero input on this device.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.560
 You know what I mean?

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.840
 Like, so they didn't even reach out to her, you know, in any regard.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:24.200
 They just took her code and said they would have no collaboration.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.200
 Yeah.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.200
 Like, I'm sorry.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.200
 They called them a partner.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.200
 They said mutable.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.200
 Yeah.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200
 Our partner mutable instruments.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200
 Yeah.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.400
 Because they invited her there or something and they were like trying to pump her for info

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.960
 and it was not a collaboration and it was more like, oh, we're going to do this thing.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.960
 And she was like, okay.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.440
 She's following the license.

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.920
 As long as you follow the fucking license.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.920
 Right.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.920
 And then anybody can.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.920
 Cool.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.560
 But they were trying to, it seemed like they were trying to pump her for like, oh, so what's

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.560
 your next shit?

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.560
 Oh, dude.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.560
 Yeah.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.760
 Can we get more code for free?

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.760
 Yeah.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.760
 Please.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.760
 Yeah.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.000
 There's more mutable models in this thing than there are anything else.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.800
 Like it's essentially a plait, plait, plait, plait, in a box, you know, with a controller.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:16.160
 Like it has currently 11 oscillator models, four of which are Artoria engines.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.160
 That's all it says.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.160
 And then seven modes.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.160
 For mutable.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.000
 It's like, so it's a little bit imbalanced.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.600
 You know what I mean?

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.600
 Yeah.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.920
 Because that's what the Corg Mini Log XD, which also came out.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:36.480
 So the Corg prologue, which is their big polyphonic analog synth has like, you can update digital

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.080
 oscillator models that you code yourself, whatever.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.200
 So they ported that same functionality over to the Mini Log XD and then the weekend, that

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.520
 weekend, some guy like knocked out the braids code and like, oh, here you go.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.360
 Like you can upload it now.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.360
 And that's cool.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.360
 They didn't really pimp that.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.640
 They just have like an open source platform that you can update effects and oscillators.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.600
 And yes, you can update plats or other stuff in there.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.000
 So obviously they didn't try to promote it outside of just having their platform.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.880
 It's kind of a lot cooler.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.880
 Yeah.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.880
 Yeah.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.880
 Also, I want that.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.800
 It's like the monologue.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:12.080
 And while it's sweet, it has increased my loss for the Mini Log XD quite a bit.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.880
 But I'm just holding onto the monologue right now, which is still awesome.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.640
 And I really like it.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:22.280
 But that does seem like a better approach, a better way to handle the situation.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.280
 Right.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.280
 Yeah.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.280
 Yeah.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.480
 Arturia changed their wording on the website now.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:32.720
 It says, our friend, our friends at mutable instruments.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.320
 And the only place it mentions it is when it talks about the oscillator modes.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.320
 Hmm.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.320
 Okay.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:44.520
 It's a fucking shame is what it is because I really like this box.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.520
 You know what I mean?

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.080
 Like, as soon as I saw it, I got hyped as hell.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:53.160
 And before like this controversy left a bad taste in my mouth, like it's an incredible

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.280
 little machine, my opinion.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.120
 They just need to like get their shit together.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.360
 The engineering solid, I think the marketing just ruined it though.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.360
 Yeah.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.360
 But I see.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.360
 Someone's going to get one eventually.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.680
 It's going to be a lot of people buy it not knowing anything about that controversy.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.680
 You know what I mean?

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.760
 There's a lot of people that probably will be buying this have no clue who mutable is.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.760
 Yeah.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.760
 You know what I mean?

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.560
 But it's like 300 bucks or something.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.560
 It's $299.

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.560
 That's ridiculous.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.560
 I wish I wanted that.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.440
 I wish I could put it for the controller and the sequencer alone.

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.440
 Yeah.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.440
 You know?

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:30.240
 Never mind the fact that you have like a whole, well, half of plates in there and some inspired

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.480
 filter, multi mode filter, you know, a lot of filter.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.480
 Yeah.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.040
 Got the whole matrix mod, you got LFOs.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:43.960
 It's like, I don't know, part of the microbrew and the mini-brew that sucked was the crappy

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.240
 keyboard and how they fixed that as well.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.240
 You know?

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.240
 Yeah.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.960
 You got the sequencer, you got the ARP, you got the touch plate, velocity sensitive, you

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.120
 know, controller.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.320
 It's got it all pretty much.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:59.320
 And you can just paint all those goofy fucking graphics.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.320
 I would tape right over there.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.320
 Yeah.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.880
 That's a big strip of electric tape.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.880
 Yeah.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.880
 Right over that crap.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.000
 I don't even know what it's supposed to be.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.160
 We were talking about that before we started recording.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.800
 It looks like vegetables.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:17.120
 And then like the random knob or the random button, I should say, is a hot pepper.

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.920
 Oh my God.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.920
 Yeah.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:25.000
 It's got spice and dice on the sequencer for generative functionality and it's a pair

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.880
 of dice and a hot pepper.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:53.160
