WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160
 (upbeat music)

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.080
 - So what are you drinking Dave?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.000
 - Oh, I'm drinking a hop devil from Victory.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.160
 - A deviled hop.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.600
 - Yeah, it's delicious.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.360
 - Not too adventurous though.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.920
 Didn't go digging deep.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.780
 - And how about you Nick?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.680
 - I'm drinking the Victory Vital IPA.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.200
 Now I wouldn't consider it vital.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.120
 (laughs)

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.280
 But it's not bad.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.640
 I think I like the hop devil more.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.840
 - I'm sipping on a lime lacroi.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.880
 - A lime.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.720
 - Lacroi.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.120
 - So you go with the lacroi, not lacroi.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.960
 - Lacroi.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.800
 - Lacroi.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.880
 - I'm American.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.960
 I say lacroics.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.800
 - Croics.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.920
 - Which I've been informed recently.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.360
 This is referred to as vegan beer.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.240
 (laughs)

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.080
 So,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.440
 electron.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.280
 - Electron.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.120
 - Electron.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.960
 - Yeah, I think it would be a good place to start.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.800
 Good cop, bad cop.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.080
 I mean, there's, they're coming in from two different,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.520
 starkly different angles.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.320
 How do you wanna, how do we wanna approach this?

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 - Well, I'd say first the hands on,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.000
 both you and Nick.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.840
 - No.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.320
 - Have the digi tacks.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.160
 - Digi tacks.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.000
 - Which we've talked about,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.360
 I think it was in the last episode of it.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.560
 'Cause it was just how kind of announced

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.640
 around that point.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.800
 - So twinkle in our eyes.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.120
 - Now you guys have hands on experience.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.840
 And Nick, you even performed with it already.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.120
 So thoughts,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.000
 opinions, feedback,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.680
 criticisms, what do we got?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.400
 - A lot of criticisms, a lot of positives though.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.880
 I still want it to be stereo,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.800
 but it's not, it is what it is.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.000
 Worked out well live,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.480
 especially with the latest OS.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.720
 It seems pretty stable,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.280
 'cause for a while it seemed like they were getting it,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.200
 getting it under control still.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.040
 Which I get it,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.400
 and you've got to release a product.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.520
 Honestly, if I knew that the rhythm to bleed into that,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.920
 if I knew the rhythm mark two was coming out,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.440
 I still wanted the MIDI sequencing.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.440
 And once I found out the trigger conditions work

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.280
 on the MIDI, I was like,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.800
 all right, I'm gonna do this,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.920
 'cause that would be awesome.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.440
 It would be nice and compact live,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.200
 but knowing the sampling was on the rhythm mark two

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200
 might have pushed me away from that a little.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.560
 Knowing like, oh I can sample on that.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.680
 That was another big reason the Digitack,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.000
 'cause it's super easy to get drum samples on it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.640
 - Yeah, I feel like that was intentional.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.560
 - Yeah, oh yeah.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.360
 - I think it's why they kept all the mark two stuff

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.400
 under wraps tightly,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.960
 until the Digitack was actually out and being sold.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.040
 But I mean, it's smart marketing I guess,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.320
 but yeah, there's some weird spill over there.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.760
 - Now you say it's not stereo,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.840
 does it not have effects built in?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.000
 - Oh yeah, it does, it's stereo out,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.160
 the sample engine's all mono.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.920
 So if you, the reverb and delay--

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920
 - Same as all you get.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.480
 Same as the real, yeah, you get the stereo out.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.120
 - Which is like, it sounds good.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.040
 The effects,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.480
 distill, like I wish that was a chorus

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.760
 and some of the octetack stuff on there.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.600
 - What cooler?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.280
 - But you know, is it just the same delay reverb

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.280
 as the rhythm, basically?

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.400
 - Yeah, I don't think they changed anything.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.240
 They made it easier,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.840
 even how you have the high frequency and low frequency controls

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.000
 on like the delay and the reverb.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.920
 They made it so,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.560
 I always forgot before on the rhythm,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.400
 I still do like,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.320
 I don't know what it's doing

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.640
 until I hear the sound change.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.840
 Like if I turn down the high passes that moving it up or down,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.080
 like I don't,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.000
 maybe it's just me,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.880
 but on the Digitack,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.720
 it's like a picture.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.560
 So now it's just like,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.760
 oh, I'm cutting off the highs

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.800
 and I know I'm doing that.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.280
 So that's kind of cool.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.040
 I'll be curious to see what they do

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.080
 for the displays on the mark too.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.600
 I kind of hope they redo them to make it like the Digitack

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.760
 'cause it's no LED and bigger,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.880
 but I wouldn't be surprised if they just upscaled it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.720
 to be like,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.560
 it's bigger now

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.400
 and on a bigger screen,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.400
 the same old UI.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.040
 - Yeah, I feel like the Mark II's,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.640
 if you're an owner of a Mark I,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.920
 I don't think there's too much incentive

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.440
 to get the Mark II's of any of them.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.280
 You know,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.880
 I guess if people don't know,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.400
 they announced the Mark II version

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.320
 of the Octatrack finally,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.160
 the rhythm,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.720
 which is odd because it's pretty recent machine

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.720
 and analog four.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.080
 But I guess if you're like coming into it fresh,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.040
 you're about to embark on one of these machines

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.880
 for the first time.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.280
 It makes sense to wait for the Mark II

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.840
 'cause they are in all ways better machines,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.440
 but it's hopefully marginal differences.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.280
 - Yeah.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.120
 - You know,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.960
 - They're probably,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.800
 they were running out of some parts

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.620
 and they were like,

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.760
 what can we do to refresh this

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.240
 and accommodate for a new screen?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.000
 'Cause they probably ran out of the old ones

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.800
 and they wanted to fix some things.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.640
 So it's like,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.480
 I don't know if they did it,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.080
 but it's not the Octatrack one especially is

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.720
 like a little disappointing.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.240
 In comparison to what it could be

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.080
 with some extra stuff like Overbridge or something.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.920
 I mean,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.760
 - I really want the rhythm overbridge.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.240
 - Yeah, premium overbridge.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.080
 Which I kind of like,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.920
 like some people were like,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.000
 oh, I don't like that they're charging money for it now,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.600
 but that also means like,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.040
 would you be happier if they just rolled it

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.080
 into the overall price

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.120
 and you were paying for it without ever knowing?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.040
 Like, I don't know.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.120
 I don't need the audio stuff from Overbridge.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.160
 - And the basic is free.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.360
 - Yeah, the basic one's free

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.400
 and that just gives you the sound library transfer,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.480
 which big criticism of the Digitact,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.080
 please add the ability to export my work.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.960
 - Yeah. - 'Cause it's freaking me out a little.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.920
 And I want to back it up.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.360
 - Everything is kind of trapped in there.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.200
 - Yeah.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.720
 They don't have the saving functionality,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.600
 which that's cool that they stabilized it,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.840
 but that should be the next thing

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.120
 is like, I really want to back my work up.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.440
 - That is one thing that I enjoyed

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.320
 about the Pioneer Terraz SV1.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.560
 You can balance everything out.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.840
 Project, samples, anything that's on there,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.800
 you can bounce out to different ways.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.680
 You can even just export it to a USB drive

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.880
 that you can plug right into the balance chain.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.720
 - Yeah, it's fine.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.480
 - I was really looking forward to an Octatrack Mark II,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.640
 but I don't see any reason to get one at this time.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.720
 You know, I'm still pretty content with the Terraz.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.520
 - Yeah, I feel like that's so close

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.600
 to what it should be in some ways.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.080
 - I feel like if I was gonna get an Octatrack,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.440
 I would just get a used Mark I at this point

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.880
 and save a dollar, you know, or a Digitact

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.360
 and make do with that.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.440
 - Like that's the thing with the rhythm.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.800
 Like the four fell out of the market.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.360
 So now they're like going for 800 bucks,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.760
 which is half of what they cost.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.960
 And now it's like, you gotta,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.360
 so you're gonna pay twice as much to get the new one?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.200
 Like, oh no.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.120
 - There's a lot of competition right now.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.640
 I mean, beyond like the Pioneer shit,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.200
 there's all the new MPC stuff that's coming out,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.720
 you know, at the same time.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.960
 I feel like it's too late.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.800
 You know what I mean?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.960
 For a Mark II Octatrack right now.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.760
 - At least agreed with one that isn't really taking it

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.800
 past the bar that the Mark I set, you know?

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.840
 - It's a pretty old machine too.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.560
 And it's for them to have spent all this time

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.240
 and this is the absolute most that they could add to it.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.520
 It's a little surprising.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.080
 - I can't believe they're not even adding

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.080
 like the trick conditions that are found

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.480
 in most of their machines now.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.880
 It's in A4, it's in the Digitact, it's in the rhythm.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.240
 And here comes Mark II Octa and it's still running

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.680
 the same OS without the shit that any other

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.160
 electron box has now.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.680
 It seems almost like it's considered

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.680
 a standard electron feature is to have

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.120
 these trick conditions in there.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.520
 - Now we talked about this in the past,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.400
 but do you think that they did this on purpose

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.120
 to differentiate the machine so that there weren't

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.920
 so many common features intentionally crippling

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.040
 some things in order to be like,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.840
 well if you want this, you have to go with this machine.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.240
 - I'm saying, yeah, partially in some features, sure,

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.760
 you know, with functionality but with shit

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.960
 that is considered like a staple now.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.640
 - Like parameter locks.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.640
 Like if they released an electron box

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.800
 that didn't have parameter locks,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.600
 you'd be like, what the fuck?

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.440
 - Right, yeah.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.920
 - And I feel like the trick conditions

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.240
 have been integrated in almost every machine now

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.560
 and it's considered just like part of the OS, you know?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.920
 And to have a new machine come out

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.200
 and not have that in there, it's kind of weird.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.280
 I mean it's pure speculation.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.160
 But I can see them having like, you know,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.520
 if you want stereo sampling, oh you have to get Octo.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.360
 - Right, right.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.200
 - Right, right.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.000
 - You can't find that with the rhythm or the digi

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.640
 and you know, things like that make sense.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.120
 - They don't have one, like just super machine.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.960
 - No.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.280
 - That has absolutely every bell and whistle

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.800
 and it costs $3,000.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.640
 - Right.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.840
 - Yeah, there's no like flagship

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.680
 that's right now.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.080
 - Yeah, it's like they're like terrified to touch the OS

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.840
 and to make any changes to it.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.440
 Who knows what the code base is like

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.360
 and definitely they don't want to conflict

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.960
 with other stuff but I bet you it would take them years

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.120
 to make like ground up, do another Octo track

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.840
 with all those features and then they would have to do it.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.320
 They would have to do something like the ER301.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.040
 They would have to do like an SDK

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.040
 so you could have a plugin architecture.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.360
 Like that's what you would need to do

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.120
 really satisfy people.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.560
 So someone could like make another effect

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.880
 or make a change to it.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.480
 Like and that's a hell of a product that's almost like

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.440
 it's like an environment, you know?

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.280
 - Yeah.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.040
 - But that would be awesome though.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.640
 Like 'cause you know, as I've had the ER301

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.680
 for a couple weeks now, the way you can chain stuff

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.360
 and just if they had that ability in the Octo track

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.000
 to just chain all these things

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.400
 and make your own control over them

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.600
 and like have a common point control,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.640
 different parameters and like a 10-uvert that essentially

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.200
 like that would be unreal.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.080
 - Like a little Max MSP-ish thing if you did it the right way.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.920
 - Right.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.560
 I mean the problem though is anytime you open like an SDK

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.280
 up to the public, there's the chance that someone's

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.920
 gonna write something shitty or problematic

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.440
 and it's difficult for them to be able to say,

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.080
 "Well, we just gave people the tools to make something

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.280
 and they fucked it up."

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.840
 It's someone sits down and they're using one that has us

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.200
 on there and they're just gonna go,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.840
 "Well, this electron gear is shit."

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.680
 - Yeah.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.520
 - And there's no explanation going,

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.520
 "Well, actually no, it's because someone did something

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.560
 deviant by using the SDK that we gave them

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.840
 by having a more closed system."

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.680
 I don't agree with this,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.800
 I think it's an artificial limitation

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.000
 that doesn't need to be there

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.320
 but from like a sort of like business branding,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.520
 it wouldn't be the first company that's done that

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.520
 in order to have like total death grip

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.640
 on how their products are perceived.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.080
 - But like also 90% of people won't give a fuck

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.920
 about that either.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.760
 - Right, exactly.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.600
 - I know, I know, I know.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.000
 - It just kinda, this is already too complicated.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 You just made it like infinitely chainable

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.880
 and I'm gonna get lost on it.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.520
 Like that's ER301, that's taking me a while

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.240
 to get up to speed.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.520
 Like the interface makes sense

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.240
 but it's like how you chain a VCA with an envelope

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.160
 and like nest stuff to make sound

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.520
 and have it trigger the normal way.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.880
 It takes like a little figuring out.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.120
 Like I just last night recorded the first stuff

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.080
 into it figuring out like,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.080
 "Oh, this is how you use audio buffers and things."

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.600
 There's like a language to it.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.840
 - So there's a ton of stuff just out of the box.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.760
 It doesn't seem like a limitation

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.640
 that no one's really made anything for it yet.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.880
 - And it's not like the author track

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.520
 is very user friendly to start.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.520
 - Right.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.800
 It was actually kind of vindicating.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.040
 There was a video I saw today at Surgeon.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.040
 It was at Schneider's laden or Schneider's Bureau

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.280
 walking through his live set.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.560
 It's like 50 minutes long.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.800
 It's a Vimeo video.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.040
 And halfway through it, he's like,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.640
 I actually don't even like this Octa track

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.800
 but it's the only thing that will do this looping trick.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.280
 And I used the headphone out to send like an audio pulse

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.400
 to my modular and that's what clocks everything.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.960
 He's like, "I don't like this thing.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.160
 This is the only thing that does it."

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.600
 And that is, it's like the only thing

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.420
 that kind of scratches that itch for this

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.840
 Uber box that lets you send some MIDI and some sequencing

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.320
 and play a sample back.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.160
 - Sure.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.400
 - Which kind of doesn't want that live, you know?

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.680
 But getting there is like kind of a pain in the ass.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.920
 - Yeah, I mean, they didn't fix that with this new one

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.960
 which is disappointing.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.240
 - Right, so it's not like if they were to take

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.480
 at that route that you're talking about,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.200
 it's not like they would be turning away people being like,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.920
 oh, this machine's too confusing.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.680
 - Now it's going to be like, yeah, it's already there.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.160
 If you jump into an Octa track,

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.080
 you're making a commitment to learn how to navigate it

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.360
 and do what you want to do and go back to the digit hack.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.360
 I've only basically like screwed around

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.680
 with electronic stuff.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.520
 I've never had one before this, just sitting down.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.360
 I've maybe looked at the manual twice.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.080
 Everything is just super intuitive.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.000
 Basically no point have I had a roadblock where I go.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.760
 All this is confusing, this doesn't make sense.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.480
 I've been super impressed with how intuitive it is

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.600
 given the electron sort of reputation

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.520
 for being sort of a two sort of thing to get into.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.680
 - I feel like that reputation came along

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.520
 with the Octa track.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.360
 - Yeah, 'cause before that--

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.200
 - Oh, it's well deserved.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.640
 It's a well deserved reputation.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.440
 - Like they even said that DigiTax

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.200
 is meant to be a throwback to the machine drum,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.600
 even though I don't understand that,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.680
 but that's what they said.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.520
 - Yeah, I don't get that either.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.200
 - And the machine drum was a fairly intuitive box.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.560
 You had your function key, everything was labeled.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.000
 Not too much menu diving.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.520
 - No, no, you're like one or two screens away

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.600
 from pretty much everything.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.160
 But then once the Octa track came out

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.980
 and the A4 and the rhythm things started getting

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.760
 way more menu diving and more convoluted.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.760
 The Octa track is just on a level of that.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.720
 Isn't beat by anything else in their lineup.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.280
 It's just like their most complex product.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.920
 - Like so many people use it live.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.440
 So that's why they keep it like still--

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.280
 - Yeah, it's still, it's still use it.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.280
 Blush responds like all these people.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.120
 - Sure.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.040
 It's like if you can figure out how to do

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.880
 the one thing you wanna do with it,

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.720
 that's all you need to learn.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.760
 - Yeah, you don't have to fuck with anything else.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.480
 Just like, okay, I figured this much out.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.680
 I'm just gonna focus on that.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.760
 I'm glad to hear that the DigiTax is

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.740
 a little more intuitive 'cause I kinda missed that.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.300
 - Yeah, about the machine drum and even the mono machine.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.380
 Like I'm sad to see that there aren't

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.300
 Mark IIs announced for those.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.460
 I would buy a Mark II mono machine and fucking heartbeat.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.540
 - Are those going for a ton now?

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.380
 - Sorry to interrupt that note.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.580
 - Yeah, yeah they are.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.020
 Whenever they announce the price drop,

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:25.020
 the electron, they used ones plummeted price-wise.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.740
 And there was like a three month period there

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.260
 where you could get a mono machine or a machine drum

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.700
 dirt cheap compared to what they would be new from electron.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.460
 And then when they announced that they were paying

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.300
 discontinued, after that like three month sale period,

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.040
 the prices of skyrocketed again.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.340
 It's hard to find a mono machine.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.540
 And if you do, it's usually a grand plus.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.660
 At least that I've seen, I don't know.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.400
 They might be going somewhere cheaper,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.500
 but I like to keep an eye on them

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.980
 'cause it's something I kinda regret selling.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.620
 - And now there's like there are X of them.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.100
 They were not gonna be anymore.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.420
 And as you get older, some of them are gonna start failing.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.620
 Some of them are gonna start having problems.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.460
 So that number's just gonna go.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.860
 - Yeah, they service them either.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.020
 - How does that work as far as like,

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.000
 do they have like an end of life type of process

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.420
 for their machines?

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.260
 - I don't know.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.100
 - Like softening things.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.660
 - Nothing that they announce to people,

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.060
 but they do at a certain point just say like,

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.220
 we're gonna stop.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.900
 We're selling these and we're gonna stop supporting them.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.260
 I don't, I would think if you bought a new mono machine

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.460
 like three years ago, I would hope that they honor

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.380
 the warranty still.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.460
 So those are only a year though on all their devices, I think.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.460
 - But they're not even making parts.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.660
 I mean, basically there's like,

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.060
 Sintarga gonna have to like step up

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.540
 and start making the parts for those.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.180
 - 'Cause I don't think, I think half of it's the screens too.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.140
 'Cause people used to sell like,

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.740
 you could get green ones and people would do like aftermarket.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.300
 And I think they're just impossible to find now.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.900
 Screens always seem to be like the big limiting factor.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.340
 If you put a screen on your device like that,

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.940
 you're gonna be screwed down the line

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.340
 like 10 years if it breaks.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.500
 - Hopefully stuff like the Terraz doesn't have that problem

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.700
 because it seems like people are gonna be making

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.620
 full color touch screens forever.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.460
 There's gonna be at least someone out there.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.740
 - Screen on that thing is amazing.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.780
 - Yeah, nice. - So nice.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.980
 Makes me wonder why I don't see other manufacturers

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.420
 utilizing screens like that now.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.740
 I mean, it's obviously, it's doable.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.460
 - Did they add this thing to dim it a little?

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.780
 Okay, that was my only complaint

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.420
 when the first time I saw you using it

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.500
 like in a dark space, it's like, holy shit.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.860
 - I kinda keep it bright, but yeah,

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.860
 you can dim the pads and all that stuff and screen.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.220
 - No, that's cool, yeah.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.300
 Yeah, I think that was like the second update or something

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.100
 where they had that ability.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.420
 And I did it immediately.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.660
 Like I saw it in the patch notes

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.180
 and as soon as I updated it was the first thing

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.300
 I did was turn down the bright notes.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.140
 - Did you see that noise engineering mixer

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.460
 that he's putting out that's kind of been quiet?

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.700
 It's like a, it's called like zerist pola or something like that.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.220
 - I did, but I didn't look into it.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.700
 - It's like a three and it's got four knobs on it,

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.020
 four switches and four jacks. - Yeah, so four channel.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.260
 - Five jacks, it's got a headphone out.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.180
 Each channel has a potentiometer and a mute switch

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.700
 to the left of it, real simple.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.460
 And you can split the output,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.700
 use it as an attenuator or some,

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.620
 it sums all to the fourth output mixer.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.140
 It's like 133 bucks for like an eight HP mixer

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.380
 with like mute switches.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.100
 And that's like, I've gotta get that thing.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.900
 Like I'm gonna fit that into the performance case somehow.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.100
 - Yeah, wait, did you say eight HP?

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.740
 - Yeah, yeah, it's just tiny.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.740
 - That's only a little bit bigger than that goes out to,

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.380
 or what's the one with the mixer

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.980
 that has the sliders and sports channel?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.500
 - Oh, the circuit abby that does that.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.700
 - Yeah. - They did the output one

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.060
 with the lit sliders.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.940
 - Yeah, which I always had my eye on 'cause I was like,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.220
 oh, that's so cool, but like this sounds like one less channel,

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.380
 but infinitely more functionality.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.340
 - Yeah, and it looks like it just looks so nice to use live

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.060
 'cause I had that Pittsburgh one, which I sold,

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.980
 which sounded great, but it wasn't,

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.940
 even at home it was like a little too much.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.900
 It felt like a little version of this,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.180
 like a Mackey or something, and it's like,

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.220
 I just, I don't need that for that much space in my modular.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.700
 - It sounded good, no beef with it or anything,

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.740
 but it's just not what I want in the modular,

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.220
 but that noise engineering one is like exactly it,

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.740
 and it's got a headphone out on it.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.420
 - And you said you could split the output.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.260
 - You could split the output.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.100
 - Mm-hmm. - So does, I mean,

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.340
 you can send it like left or right output.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.420
 - Oh, it's not stereo. - Okay.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.740
 - You can, every input has an output too,

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.900
 so if you want to, you can break them out of the box.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.580
 - Oh, gosh, okay, okay, is there any way there?

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.780
 Okay, is there any way to route the output

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.380
 to more than one output?

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.580
 Is it just like one sum or is there like AB?

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.860
 - No, I think it's just one sum that's all mono.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:29.060
 That's the one downside, there's no stereo-ness to it.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.900
 - Gotcha.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.020
 - And also that, one that's sweet,

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.820
 but 500 bucks is that Rebel technology Praga.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.420
 Have you seen that one where it's like two stereo

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.300
 aux sends and returns, like five channel mixer

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.780
 with clickless mutes and awesome.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.580
 And there's the aux knob, you twist it to the left

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.340
 and it's the first one, you twist it to the right

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.740
 and it's the second aux.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.780
 And it's like really clear, like mutes at the bottom

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.500
 with lit switches, all clickless.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.860
 It's like 500 bucks, but it looks like pretty damn sweet.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.220
 - It's a little simpler.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.220
 - No, one went totally under my radar.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.820
 - It just came out recently, I think.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.620
 They have the kind of calm, he's looking like face-poles.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.460
 - Oh, yeah.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.660
 - They have like the, they have that one sequencer

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.540
 like the stroygia or something like that.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.780
 - But yeah, it looks cool.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.060
 And it's kind of smaller than the Pittsburgh,

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.820
 and that's my little mixer diversion.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.900
 Cause I saw that noise engineering one a few days ago.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.780
 It was like, oh shit, it kind of dropped it along

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.460
 with the percido news, but kept it quiet.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.660
 I guess it's coming out soon.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.860
 It's like dirt cheap.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.060
 - You're calling it percido?

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.620
 - Yeah, I've been calling it percido.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.860
 I didn't know, I didn't know which is correct.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:34.700
 - No idea.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.980
 - I like how we all come up with different ways

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.420
 to pronounce noise engineering stuff all the time.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.980
 - Like I always did was like the one with the L.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.460
 Yeah, in that video.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.220
 - Yeah, like the, the locale like Dave always says,

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.060
 "How do you say it?"

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.420
 - Look, look, look, look, yeah.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.500
 - Yeah, look, yeah, it should always call.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.980
 - We just make up our own pronunciations

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.020
 for noise engineering stuff.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.580
 - It's just an extra every time.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.620
 - The percido, percido looks fucking amazing.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.380
 It's available for pre-order on control mod I saw,

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.540
 but I haven't pulled the trigger yet,

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.220
 but I'm definitely keeping an eye on it.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.060
 Where would you put it though?

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.900
 - I freed up space just for it.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.740
 - Oh, okay.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.980
 - I sold one of my BIAs.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.820
 - Really?

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.340
 - Yeah, I have one now instead of two.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.380
 In preparation for it.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.500
 - Yeah.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.180
 - Because I like the BIAs, but I like the Lekeluk too.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.180
 So this thing looks like a mixture of the two.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.020
 - Yeah.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.860
 - You know what I mean?

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.380
 It's like if you blended the BIA with the Lekel idea.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.220
 - Yeah, I mean, yeah.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.060
 - I don't know.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.380
 - Which is just an appealing sentence.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.460
 I mean, like that it looks amazing.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.820
 - So yeah, I have enough space for it now.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.380
 I'm gonna slap it in there right next to the Basilimus.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.020
 The demo vids for it show that it can be free running,

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.860
 which is awesome.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.540
 You don't have to have the envelopes locked.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.300
 So you can let it drone basically.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.460
 You'll have CV functionality that you won't have

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.020
 on the normal Lekeluk.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.140
 Like for example, you can CV the algorithm.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.620
 If you're using it as like a synth voice.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.380
 - That is my only complaint about that.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.220
 It's not being able to CV it.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.460
 - That was one of mine too.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.020
 When I was using it live, I was manually hitting the switch.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.540
 But I was like, man, it would be nice to be able to see.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.060
 - Well, the thing about the manual too is it

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.300
 because it's a three state switch going from one to three.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.700
 You had to go through two, right?

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.540
 That was the bummer.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.900
 I was like, oh, like, if I could even if it was just like

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.020
 a knot or something in some way for me to get from one

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.380
 to three. - That would be cool.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.220
 - But I mean, that's--

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.140
 - Some way to scan through those models.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.140
 Like on a pot, that would have been awesome.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.900
 - It's slightly bigger than two BIAs, I think.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.140
 - So that by side.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.580
 - If I remember correctly.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.420
 It looks awesome.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.620
 I saw there was a few other new stuff from him.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.220
 - Well, you were telling me too about their,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.220
 like almost a utility analog VCO.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.420
 - Oh, that sync-a-terre.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.340
 - Yeah, that's the one.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.500
 I had totally missed that.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.100
 Like, I just never noticed it.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.700
 - I figured you dig this while I showed it to you.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.540
 - Yeah.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.380
 - Like right up your alley.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.220
 - Yeah.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.380
 - Yeah, I got it last minute back in the summer.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.660
 Like I needed a small VCO.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.500
 - Oh, okay.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.060
 - That, you know, was a little unusual.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.420
 And it was hoping for, like, I was looking at noise modules

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.700
 too, like I just wanted something that was compact

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.980
 and able to do noise.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.620
 And I saw that thing had a noise mode on it

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.180
 and quantizer and act as LFO and whole nine yards.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.260
 Had the super wave mode.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.660
 I was like, this thing pretty nice for HP.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.500
 - Yeah.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.820
 - Kind of pricey for a 4HP module.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:17.660
 You know what I mean?

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.660
 - It's like three interlocks.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.500
 - It's doing a lot, though.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.340
 - Yeah.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.380
 - It's pretty versatile, pretty compact.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.220
 I dig it.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.900
 - I would say too, his shit never has like issues.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.740
 But I know of that.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.580
 - Not what I mean.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.420
 - It's always solid, yeah.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.260
 - Always solid.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.620
 It always works, like, no trickery.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.380
 - Is anybody telling him that we're just gushing endlessly

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.700
 about his product?

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.900
 Like, if he needs anyone to demo anything, wink, wink.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.100
 Or like, watch his car or watch his dog.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.260
 I mean, not too much other new stuff that caught my eye

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.660
 recently, aside from that, except for the plonk.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.460
 - The, for me, it was the variation of the Turing machine.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.300
 - Oh, yeah.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.980
 - Yeah, see, I haven't even looked at it.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.980
 - Permutation.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.820
 - Permutation.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.420
 - That fixed everything about the Turing machine

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.300
 that kind of bugged me.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.140
 - Tell me about it.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.620
 - 'Cause the big thing is, it's built on the Turing machine,

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.540
 but it has gate outs for everything

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.580
 as opposed to like that pulses where you would have

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.260
 just a subset and a couple of combinations.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.660
 This now has every step.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.780
 - Okay, so with every note on, it's generating a gate?

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.820
 - Yes, at least it's--

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.660
 - Is that correct?

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.060
 - Yeah, every like clock it gets in,

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.740
 it's gonna shit out a clock at the appropriate jack

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.660
 based on the pattern.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.500
 - Exactly.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.940
 - And now you can tap in any of those

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.460
 instead of just like one three pie,

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.020
 or something like that.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.900
 - Yeah, the pulses combinations that they had.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.420
 'Cause there was like one four and seven

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.540
 would give you, like, there was an and.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.380
 - Yeah.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.460
 - Like, it's cool.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.420
 But if you could build those, your own with logic,

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.460
 that's even cooler.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.300
 - Right.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.420
 - Well, and also, right and save toggle is not CVable.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.980
 So you can send that a gate to do the right.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.580
 - Oh yeah, you can write the sequence

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.060
 to the Turing machine instead of just like,

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.940
 kind of give me something new and then lock it again.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.140
 - Right.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.180
 - Interesting.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.260
 And is this by the same people, or is this somebody else?

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.220
 - It's by grayscale, but they got the,

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.660
 at least the muffler wiggler thread,

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.980
 states that they got like the blessing of whoever

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.900
 made the Turing machine till I hear otherwise,

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.980
 this is on the up and up as far as a legit,

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.500
 you know, variation on Turing.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.220
 - Yeah, I think it's all open source anyway.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.460
 So I was just like, falling the license

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.660
 and got the dudes okay.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.500
 - Yeah.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.340
 - Is it all DIY?

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.180
 - I don't know.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.020
 - There's a premium.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.860
 - It's a good question.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.060
 'Cause I know grayscale does have a couple of kits,

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:24.900
 but I think it's--

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.900
 - So it's complete stuff, too.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.100
 - He does remember all of us building those

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.500
 turns and all the expanders at one time.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.820
 That was a lot of work.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.660
 - Still missing.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.980
 - I do too, I truly regret selling that thing.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.060
 - It was a lot of work.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:43.020
 - But I mean, I don't think he's even decided

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.260
 how big the panel's gonna be,

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.140
 like where they're cutting off the function.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.860
 - Oh, okay, so it's still like very much

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.860
 a work in progress?

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.860
 - Yeah, I just wanna announce it.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.700
 - Okay.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.820
 - I wouldn't expect it anytime soon.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.300
 - I mean, I'd be wrong, but at least based on what,

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.460
 interaction and thread was still designed,

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.100
 but how big are we talking?

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.580
 - I think the big one was going, I might be wrong,

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.020
 I think the big one was gonna be 18.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.500
 And then the smaller one was gonna be like 12 or 14,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.820
 and then there was gonna be like a weird expansion thing

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.220
 that was optional.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.020
 - I kind of use the voltage block

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.740
 as a Turing machine in some ways.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.900
 Like, I feel that.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.740
 - You know what I mean?

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.460
 I'll just pound a random sequence on one of the channels

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.900
 until something I like,

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.900
 and then I'll sometimes even like randomize that sequence.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.740
 You know what I mean?

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.620
 - It's good random.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:29.860
 You can't like send it CV to generate new random,

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.140
 but it is a handy source for randomness

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.340
 when you need it in a pinch.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.180
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.580
 - And if you feed the random into the varigate,

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.500
 it's on the same bus,

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.180
 it'll also randomize the voltage block.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.220
 So if you take like the trigger out from the end

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.380
 on the varigate and put it in the freeze,

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:49.220
 or in the random, it randomizes the voltage block settings too,

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.580
 which some people don't like,

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.820
 that it randomizes both, but it kind of like trickles down.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.100
 - So there's no way to turn that off?

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.740
 - I don't think so.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.820
 You can randomize the voltage block by itself,

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.900
 but if you randomize that varigate and it's on that bus,

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.140
 it's gonna send that same signal to the voltage block.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.660
 - So you have mine on the same block now,

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.220
 but I don't, I haven't updated to the version

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.620
 of the voltage block firmware that like can recognize,

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.940
 you know, the varigate yet.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.180
 And I'm concerned with it.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.220
 I don't really, I don't think I need that bus stuff.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.660
 I just patch it manually.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.500
 - That's all he fixes.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.660
 Even with it, I always patch it manually

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.940
 'cause it's not reliable.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.300
 Doesn't always sync all the time.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.460
 - That's still kind of weird.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.980
 Is there any kind of rhyme or reason,

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.780
 is there any pattern or is it just randomly?

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.620
 - If you turn the module off and on again,

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.820
 and most of the time it will then start to sync.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.660
 So something is locking up during the startup process

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.820
 or some issues occurring.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.380
 But that being said, I almost sold the varigate

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.940
 and I was like, I even had it on muffler, took it down.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.580
 And I'm super glad I didn't,

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.940
 'cause I'm already using it a bunch

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.820
 and it just does what it does.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.660
 There are things like mind shifts forward in time

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.660
 when I move the slider when it's playing.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.500
 But I think that happens to a bunch of people.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.420
 We'll see if it gets fixed,

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.700
 but either way it's kind of a beast.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.540
 - Right.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.220
 I mean, is that something you are changing

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.540
 while you're playing live or do you have a lot?

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.540
 - You're just not anymore.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.500
 - Yeah, I brought mine out on that mini tour.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.260
 Had the presets saved, you know what I mean?

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.180
 But I didn't tweak much on the sliders.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.380
 I just kind of let it run.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.500
 - Yeah, I noticed if you tweak it live,

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.660
 it could cause problems.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.420
 I would mute things on the fly.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.500
 That was about it.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.020
 I didn't really wanna mess with it too much

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.940
 in the during performance.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.860
 - Just let it do its thing.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.700
 - Just want your stuff.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.140
 - Program to change patterns.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:38.980
 - That's it.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.560
 (upbeat music)

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:52.020
 - Oh, some sort of brain-eating bacteria.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:52.860
 - Oh, that's the thing.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.740
 If you don't, you have to use distilled,

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.940
 if you use tap water,

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.300
 you can fuck yourself up with an eddy pot.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.820
 You have to use distilled water,

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.660
 or tap water that was boiled that you let cool down.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:06.740
 But if you just take regular tap water or something,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.580
 you can definitely,

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.500
 if there are those protodular,

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.340
 whatever the fuck in the water,

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.460
 you let that shit get in your brain.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.980
 It's similar to the stuff that kills people.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.540
 And swimming pool is now when they go in

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.500
 and they get some water in their nose,

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.340
 which is always terrifying.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.500
 - That is one of many reasons

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.700
 why I don't enjoy swimming.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.380
 - No, I'm looking forward to going to the other side.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.220
 - No, yeah, I'm coming here.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.660
 - I don't know anything about what's gonna happen,

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.380
 but I would be,

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.780
 if they had a knife convention,

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.940
 that was also right next to the, that would be the shit.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.620
 If you wanna try to play to that market,

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.980
 like I would box a knife.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.420
 - I tell you what I went to the anime con last year,

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.860
 and they had a fucking vape convention

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.380
 on the opposite side of the con.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.060
 - Dude, this blueberry man.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.940
 - All you could smell was vape.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.940
 - And they're all staring at all these cosplayers,

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.660
 like what, and we're all staring at these dudes

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.860
 who are all chasing the fattest rips.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.100
 I'm like, what the fuck, man?

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.100
 It was so bizarre.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.260
 - Also, it was like a shitload of different vape flavors,

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.820
 all sort of like blending together.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.340
 - Oh yeah, they split the convention center.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.300
 - Did it smell like a swamp?

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.060
 - Yeah, the smell just kind of lingered over,

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.180
 even though it was like blocked off.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.660
 - You can't block that off, right?

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.660
 - It was very bizarre, yeah.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.180
 You could just smell these different smells.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.620
 And I kept getting a whiff, I'm like, what the fuck?

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.500
 And then I went up on that tunnel, you know what I mean?

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.620
 The bridge, like on the second floor.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.500
 And you can see like both floors on the right floor.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.540
 I'm just seeing like, you know, anime con going crazy.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.900
 I look on the left and there's like these circles of people

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.420
 blowing out all these clouds

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.420
 and like demonstrating vaporizers

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.780
 and talking about flavors of shit.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.780
 And I'm just like, what?

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:42.060
 It's just an odd thing to partner with an anime con.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.580
 - Yeah, although I think it's a partnership,

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.940
 I think it's just like coincidence.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.020
 'Cause I don't think no con partnered up

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.140
 with the real estate flipper.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.940
 It was just a two thing that was scheduled that weekend, yeah.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.140
 - But I'm just lobbying for knife show.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:55.980
 - Absolutely.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.900
 - You can hear us at Schomburg, Illinois,

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.140
 a hotel whose name I don't remember.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.860
 Good knife show in there.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.780
 - Absolutely.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.220
 And babe.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.860
 - I just found a bunch of my throwing stars

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.700
 and that's probably why I thought I'm gonna work it.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.220
 (laughing)

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.980
 - 'Cause those are so huge.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.740
 - Have you had any nerd household is complete

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.300
 without a fucking sharp throwing option.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.540
 - You need something to throw that's kinda sharp.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.380
 - Can you throw it?

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.460
 - You need your mall swords.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.860
 You need your shrukins.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.260
 - Battleaxe. - Your blow guns.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.300
 - Battleaxe.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.140
 - Crossbows.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.140
 - Battleaxe.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.700
 - You know, I almost bought a battleaxe

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:38.300
 at the last rent fair, but instead I bought a cape instead.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.340
 - Cool. - Yeah.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.500
 It's pretty, it's pretty, you've seen it.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.340
 - I've seen your cape, yeah.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.380
 I know how much that was.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.340
 - It's a nice fucking cape. - It's a nice fucking cape.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.860
 I would've got the cape and the battleaxe.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.860
 - Nah, I couldn't afford both.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.460
 - That's true. - That's rent fair.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.500
 - That's rent fair. - That makes tough choice.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.700
 It's a rent fair.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.500
 - I'm sure we hear the story of id Software

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.340
 when you were making a doom.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.020
 They hit an old oak door in the place that they were renting.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.420
 And he just had battleaxes, just grabbing an axe

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.700
 and throwing against this big oak door.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.140
 So I was like, oh, fucking chopped up.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.620
 - You can do that a rent fair.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.460
 And it's fun.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.900
 (laughing)

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.660
 I mean, they have throwing stars and knives too,

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.180
 at rent fair, but it's like,

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.260
 you have fucking rent fair.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.100
 - Yeah. - If you have the option

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.700
 to throw an axe, I'm gonna throw a fucking axe.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.180
 - Yes.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.700
 - Fuck, what were we talking about?

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.020
 - Not a gong. - Not a gong.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:20.860
 - Yes.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.860
 - Would she get a booth?

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.380
 - For axe though.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.580
 We could ask people to bring,

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.860
 like their junk gear, shit that's broke.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.940
 - Oh yeah. - You know?

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.540
 Set that up, throw your axe at gear.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.540
 - Got an old electric car. - You go to the electric car.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.540
 - You're sick of, throw a fucking axe at it.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.300
 - You have a question. - Yeah, and old fuck.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.540
 (laughing)

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:42.940
 (laughing)

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:43.780
 - No, that was good.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.040
 (laughing)

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.120
 (laughing)

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.960
 - Yeah, it would be cool if there was a room dedicated

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.920
 just for people who were showing off their shit

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.440
 and, you know, jammin'.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.480
 - So that one dude brought that TTSH

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.560
 that he had like just built. - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.240
 - And like, he walked away and we were like,

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.600
 ooh, don't mind if I do.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.440
 (laughing)

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.960
 And we just, 'cause they got built in speakers too

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.200
 and they got pretty loud and we just made an obnoxious

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.920
 fucking noise patch on it.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.080
 And then we walked away and just let it drone on.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.440
 - Until the dude came back.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.880
 - You called it great.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.320
 - I was impressed by the sound coming out of that thing.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.400
 Tiny speakers, big sound.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.240
 - Yeah.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.160
 (laughing)

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.840
 - It was cool.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.000
 They're kind of un-obtanium now, but yeah.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.760
 - Yeah, those kids are fucking sweet.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.520
 - Yeah.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.320
 - He was selling that one, I think.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.600
 - No, I think he built two of them

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.560
 and he had one for sale.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.000
 I guess the cover of the cost of building

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.240
 the other one type of thing,

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.480
 but it was like, I think you saw it for like 32,

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.320
 something like that.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.320
 - Yeah, he probably just likes that now.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.160
 - Really?

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.000
 - Oh yeah, there's stuff.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.440
 - Yeah, it's not, you can get a lot of money

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.280
 for those now.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.640
 - Wow.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.320
 - Especially with like we were talking about last week,

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.080
 the vintage stuff kind of going through the ceiling.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.040
 Like, those orbs are really expensive now.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.640
 The TTSH is kind of like,

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.480
 wow, this one might not break for another fucking 15 years.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.680
 You know, I would take that over a regular one.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.520
 - Yeah.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.800
 - Smaller too.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.640
 - So did they just stop building those boards

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.480
 or something?

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.320
 Like what?

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.160
 - You guys can build them.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.360
 - Because they at Thonk still has a rare parts kit for them.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.000
 That's just like, here's all the hard stuff.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.800
 You just have to get the PCB, the enclosure or whatever.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.400
 Inclosures sounds like it would be real.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.000
 Like that would be, that'd be hell of a project.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.640
 - If you have access to like CNC machine,

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.800
 might not be too bad.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.920
 - So wait, what else is on the list?

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.880
 You don't even mean a list?

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.920
 - Yeah, what are you, you're excited about it.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.920
 You're gonna get some plonk action, right?

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.760
 - Yeah.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.600
 - I'm kind of excited to check that out.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.600
 - Plonk is definitely on my list, yeah.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.040
 In fact, I sold my elements over it.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.400
 - Which is right next to me.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.400
 - Yeah, I have to box it up and ship it.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.680
 Yeah, I don't know, I like elements,

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.720
 but the thought that I could fit two plonks

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.920
 in the space of like one elements

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.560
 and probably get the same results.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.400
 I don't know, it's definitely peeling me.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.160
 And I just, I'm pretty intelligel heavy setup already,

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.000
 you know?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.760
 I think the plonk is real peeling,

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.840
 and especially for live being able to save your setup.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.680
 You know what I mean?

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.200
 I hate to use the word presets,

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.120
 but you know, I could have different sounds saved

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.680
 that I could recall live, and that's nice, you know what I mean?

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.040
 - You looked into this more than I have,

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.360
 so I looked at it and I was like,

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.000
 it's a modeling percussive elements,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.360
 but there's no direct envelope control

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.800
 of like attack into end.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.360
 It doesn't look like it has it on the panel,

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.200
 or maybe I'm missing something.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.160
 - It has assignable.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.760
 - Oh, so it's not knobs.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.080
 - There's knobs, it's just they're assignable.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:44.920
 - Kind of like the monitor.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.760
 - It's on the rain making.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.600
 - Exactly.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.400
 - Okay, so as you go to that,

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.800
 you still have that kind of control.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.280
 - Yep, you can assign different shit.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.840
 There is a model of unit two, yeah.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.680
 - So models of unit.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.520
 - Oh, that's cool.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.360
 - Yeah, okay.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.000
 - And the elements had one too, like just depending,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.400
 like you had your gate input and your strength input,

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.360
 which was like velocity type of control.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.720
 Depends on how you hit the envelope.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.640
 - Right.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.880
 - But like whereas the elements has everything

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.560
 spread out real nice for you on the panel.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.000
 - And has a knob and a tennewater for everything

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.880
 and input, you have to pick and choose.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.680
 - From what I gather,

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.000
 you have a lot of options on the plonk as well.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.760
 It's just you're gonna have to do a little bit of assigning

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.160
 and menu diving to get there.

00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.000
 - Okay.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.480
 - Which I hate, but.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.080
 - But can you set it as a preset then?

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.200
 And then recall that.

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.240
 I mean, is that how it's gonna work?

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.080
 - Yes.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.360
 That is what is appealing to me.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.680
 'Cause like I can fiddle around on elements forever.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.600
 And you know, and I do every time I play with it,

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.760
 it'd be nice to be able to save that type of setup.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.600
 - Gotcha.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.440
 - You know what I mean?

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.280
 - Yeah, I'm gonna be able to do it live.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.280
 - Also it has the random functions, which is interesting.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.760
 You know, if you just want a crazy fucking percussion,

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.960
 I don't know if you can adjust what you want

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.560
 the randomness to go towards.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.440
 Like you came with the Rainmaker, that would be nice

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.440
 if you can scale it back a bit instead of just having it

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.520
 like full on random, but just the fact that that's there

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.360
 is nice.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.200
 Richard Divine did a couple videos showing it

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.720
 and full Richard Divine fashion.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.280
 And it's definitely like interesting to see it being used

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.720
 as like a glitch percussion generator.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.560
 You know what I mean?

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.640
 Instead of just like your standard physical modeling bongo.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.320
 - Is it like a tight go or whatever that is?

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.400
 - No, is that a Solonix thing too?

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.240
 Or is that--

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.080
 - Nope, separate.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:28.920
 - Okay, this is out.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.160
 - Not some of my knowledge, but maybe he's,

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.040
 he did something in the background,

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.200
 but just for the no, it's just intelligible in that AAS.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.560
 - Oh, right, that's who it is.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.760
 It's where the AAS.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.040
 - Yeah, but I would say that the module,

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.880
 which should not be named, is that sound quality on that.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.480
 It's fucking ridiculous.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.440
 Like it's really good.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.840
 - I was impressed with that.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.040
 Like immediately I fucked with the pitch shifter

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.640
 and listened to the sound quality and stereo and shit.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.000
 And I was just like, yeah.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.280
 I was like, that's what I was looking for right there.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.120
 - Compared to the Echo Phone, for instance,

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.240
 it's a completely different world.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.600
 - Yeah, Plunk has me excited because,

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.000
 I don't know, every few months I get on this kick

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.800
 where I'm sick of everything that I have

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.600
 that make drums with, you know what I mean?

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.440
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.200
 - And I always like look for a new drum machine

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.760
 or a new drum model, because it's a never ending search for me.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.000
 And put the Plunk and then the,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.480
 that noise engineering, Perkido,

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.240
 - Both have my attention.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.360
 - That's a nice thing, but the 301,

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.160
 'cause it's like the antithesis of that,

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.840
 it's like infinitely, like ultra menu diving.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.040
 But you can make these quick save states really easy.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.080
 So it's like, oh, just bring up the last thing I'm working on.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.680
 It asks you, like, you want me to bring up

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.680
 the last thing you're working on?

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.920
 You're like, yep, just kinda, I know what that is right now.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.760
 So I think after I save up a few chains,

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.280
 it'll be like, I'll get these instruments.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.960
 And the cool thing, he added the ability to screenshot,

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.720
 which is nice, it just outputs like a PNG file

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.000
 into this folder, so now people can finally be like,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.320
 oh, I did this and it made this bug,

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.120
 or here's my chain of stuff,

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.640
 and you can just share them that way,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.160
 and be like, just do this and it'll make this,

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.520
 'cause that kind of enables the ability to share things

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.160
 a little more easily, 'cause they're all just like a Lua,

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:16.160
 Lua file, it's like that Mac, like heavy format for,

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.920
 yeah, it's like, essentially a programming scripting language

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.720
 that all the chains are made in, so you can,

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.200
 they're really small and you can trade them with people.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.560
 - Oh, that's cool.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.720
 But one thing to the point, I saw it was kind of sad,

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.760
 the Valhalla Sean Costello just said he won't do any effects

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.520
 for them, he's kind of like claiming loyalty to the ZDSP,

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.320
 which I understand, like that's completely respectable,

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.840
 and he's like, I have my head around the FV1 spin processor

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.040
 now, like I know how to make things for that,

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.560
 like your format is something else I'd have to learn

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.000
 and go whole other SDK and stick with them,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.040
 'cause they've treated me good.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.560
 And I was like, all right, I respect that.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.360
 And he was pretty open when he was talking about

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.080
 developing the halls of Valhalla for ZDSP

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.000
 and talking about the problems he was overcoming

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.960
 'cause there's crazy limitations of it.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.440
 - Oh yeah, there's like 128--

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.280
 - There's like 128-- - There's like 128--

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.320
 - Instructions, or there's a lot of instructions

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.800
 but there's 128 Macs, but it's a ridiculous number

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.480
 of limitations, it's really interesting

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.000
 that he was able to pull crazy shit out of it

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.960
 with those limitations, but that wasn't overnight.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.240
 - Especially when you wanna uphold

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.960
 like what's a very high quality brand at this point.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.920
 - Like this shit, you know.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.520
 It's the shit, as far as plug-ins for Reverb and all that.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.920
 Like, just having a master.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.840
 - I got all those cards, even shimmer.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.320
 I never use anything except the halls of the hall

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.080
 and I didn't know nothing, like it's so weird.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.680
 - That reminds me actually.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.600
 Summer name.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.440
 - Oh yeah.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.280
 - There was like nothing, it happened.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.200
 - Oh yeah, it happened.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.480
 The only thing that was announced was the Eventide

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.240
 modules and-- - And the play.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.800
 - Yeah, and I was--

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.160
 - 500 millisecond delay.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.280
 - And I was very disappointed that it wasn't

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.480
 like an Eventide space module, you know what I mean?

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.600
 Which I would probably buy in a heartbeat.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.680
 - It was an odd offering for their first module

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.440
 to put out like that delay, which isn't going to excite

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.840
 people, especially when people know like that space pedal,

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.680
 it's amazing, you know, people use it live.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.160
 Make a patched out version like that guy did DIY style

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.040
 and you would sell quite a few of them, you know?

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.120
 Like that would be as popular as a ZDSP I would think.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:20.960
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.720
 - Especially if they gave you some ability to switch

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.600
 the algorithm to go from like reverb to a pitch shifting

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.800
 or something like that.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.360
 So it's probably just they're not familiar

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.240
 with the market as much as we are.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.080
 - Like a big instrument.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.120
 - And they're probably like putting their feet

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.160
 in the water a little, not doing it maybe, yeah.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.080
 - I don't know, the natural thing would be for them

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.800
 to do the space with each nine.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.640
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.400
 - Here's this version, but they're probably scared

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.960
 of the power requirements.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.680
 Can we use an amp?

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.000
 No, probably not, you know?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.720
 You're probably gonna put like most people

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.080
 would need a new case or a new power supply

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.240
 to like use another amp for something.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.720
 - Right.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.200
 - It might be a little trebidacious of that.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.400
 - Yeah, what else is on the list, Greg?

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.240
 - That was it for gear and then I was just gonna

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.800
 mention, I think that's it, yeah.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:15.520
 I was gonna mention the soundtracks.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.520
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.040
 Kind of wanted to talk about soundtracks for a minute.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.640
 - Well, soundtracks.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.040
 - So here's the thing.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.280
 I went and saw Dunkirk two nights ago, right?

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.120
 - Oh, okay.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.320
 - Yeah, which the sound was fucking amazing for.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.360
 I enjoyed the soundtrack, it was like very low key.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.200
 You know what I mean?

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.280
 - Was that also Hans Zimmer?

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.880
 - I don't know, but it sounded like it

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.200
 'cause it reminded me of certain parts

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.080
 of the Dark Knight soundtrack.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.080
 Like there was a lot of strings droning in the background,

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.720
 very slow, just building suspense and tension.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:55.160
 And all the sounds of like the guns and the planes

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.040
 and everything was amazing.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.960
 But before the movie started,

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.960
 there was a Blade Runner 2049, right?

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.800
 - Oh yeah.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.960
 - Okay.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.040
 I've been trying to avoid everything and anything

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.520
 having to do with the new Blade Runner.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.120
 'Cause I didn't wanna spoil it.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.640
 I didn't wanna build up hype for myself.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.480
 You know what I mean?

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.320
 - I'm just gonna go see it.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.400
 - I need to know any piece of information about it.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.240
 - Like I'm already sold.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.840
 - Yeah, well I'm not sold.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.840
 - I'm gonna go see it.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.000
 - I'm gonna see it.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.040
 But I had like no expectations that I'd enjoy it.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:26.880
 You know what I mean?

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.720
 Like fair enough.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.560
 - Fair enough.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.480
 - I fucking love Blade Runner.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.400
 - Yeah, which is expected.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.560
 And it does have Harrison Ford back in it.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:39.080
 And like, I think that's a great idea.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.760
 But like everything that he has done

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.080
 and every role that he has revisited

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.920
 has been kind of weak over the last--

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.760
 - It's Han Solo.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.600
 - It's pretty good.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.600
 - It's Han Solo, Richard was pretty good.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.520
 - It was okay.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.840
 - It wasn't as bad as his Indiana Jones Richard.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.960
 - It wasn't nearly as bad as he was last.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:55.960
 - Last one.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.000
 I don't really want to.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.800
 - Wait, the Crystal Skull?

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.120
 - I didn't see the Crystal Skull one.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.320
 - Yeah, it's pretty bad.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.840
 And I don't know.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.520
 I just felt like his Han Solo was kind of--

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.360
 - I liked that though.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.560
 - Kind of phoned in also.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.480
 So when I heard that he was gonna be

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.560
 in the new Blade Runner again,

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.360
 I'm like, yes, I want Harrison Ford in Blade Runner.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.640
 It just wouldn't be Blade Runner without him.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.480
 But at the same time,

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.920
 I'm like, I don't want to see fucking Harrison Ford

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.240
 phoning it in because in my opinion,

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.880
 the original Blade Runner is like one of his best

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.640
 fucking performances of all time,

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.360
 aside from Raiders of the Last Dark.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.720
 - That is fucking Harrison Ford.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.640
 You know, when I think of him,

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.240
 I think those two fucking movies.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.680
 - I don't want to know anything about this.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.800
 I'm going as cold as possible.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.960
 - That's the thing in the trailer

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.560
 they kind of touched on that already.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.840
 I'm sitting there ready to watch Don Kirk and all of a sudden,

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:43.400
 I recognize the aesthetic immediately.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.080
 - Was there like, oh, this looks like

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.680
 this is gonna be a fucking Blade Runner trailer.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.040
 And then it was and I heard the sound.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.040
 - Is it Van Jealous?

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:50.880
 Is it Van Jealous?

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.720
 Don't I get in?

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:52.800
 - That's where I was coming to.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.000
 There is definitely like a redone,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.160
 Vangelis score.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.000
 - Okay.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.120
 - Like throughout the trailer, I'm like, oh shit,

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.040
 this sounds like Vangelis did the soundtrack.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.760
 You know, and I got pumped and I came home

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.880
 and I looked into it.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.800
 It's actually not Vangelis.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.440
 - It is, and I'm probably gonna say this all wrong,

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.240
 Johan Johansson.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.920
 - He does like ambient stuff.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.600
 He played at the Rex for people in Pittsburgh.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.440
 - I'm sure listening.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.960
 - Yeah, a couple years ago, it was astounding.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.840
 Like, his music is amazing.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.480
 - I will say that part of the trailer I saw,

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.160
 I was like, oh, the sound, like it sounds like a fucking C.S.E.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.320
 going nuts right now.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.240
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.120
 I would have bet money that it was Vangelis.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.160
 But apparently it's not, it's him.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.120
 - Oh, that's super exciting.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.320
 'Cause I like you fan of his, yeah.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.480
 - Yeah, that's why I wanted to touch upon it here,

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.800
 even though it's a little off track.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.440
 But yeah, I was like kind of pumped for it

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.120
 because he does good work.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:45.960
 - Yeah.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.600
 - And so once I found that out, I did some digging

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:53.600
 and he said like he has given a lot of props to Vangelis

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.720
 on the original score and wanted to keep, you know,

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.120
 what he created there like intact,

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.000
 but also do his own thing with it.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 So like, kind of cool.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.840
 Like I guess the two are buddies about it.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.200
 There's no like bad blood or anything.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.200
 Like so it's interesting.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.640
 I'm very interested to see his take on Blade Runner soundtrack.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.920
 Recently a couple movies that I've watched

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.640
 happened to be scored by him

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.880
 and the soundtrack's all stuck in my head, you know what I mean?

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.120
 Like I don't know if you ever seen Sicario.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.920
 - No, I've heard that it was good.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.880
 - He does the soundtrack for it and it's fucking excellent.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.240
 - I like strings, you know what I mean?

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.800
 Especially when it comes to cinema.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.120
 Like I just feel like it's, you know, it's a good instrument

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.000
 that goes well with moving pictures.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.480
 All the time it helps build tension and shit.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.560
 And it's like all strings and like filthy fucking percussion

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.160
 that like swells and builds in on top of it.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.680
 Like there's a song on Scarra soundtrack called The Beast.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.920
 And I've listened to it like prior 100 times

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.560
 in the last month since I've seen the movie.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.760
 'Cause it's just, it's like,

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.520
 I can't get it out of my fucking head.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.160
 And it's just, it's really excellent.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.080
 Really ominous, very ambient.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.360
 And then like there's this, you know,

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.000
 like industrial percussion that builds on top of it

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.200
 after a while and it just fills in real nice.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.440
 And it kind of reminded me of, you know,

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.040
 like throbbing gristle and shit like that in some ways.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:12.880
 - Oh wow.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.360
 - And then I read an article while I was looking into him

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.360
 doing the Blade Runner soundtrack and shit

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.840
 that where he was talking about Sicario

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.000
 and that he was heavily influenced

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.640
 by a classic industrial, namely throbbing gristle.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.480
 - Oh, that's awesome.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.880
 - Yeah, so I was like, okay.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.240
 (laughing)

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.160
 I like this dude.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:35.200
 He knows, like if anyone should be scoring Blade Runner

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.160
 who isn't evangelist, I think would be him.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.000
 You know what I mean?

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.280
 Like I think that's a good choice

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.440
 and I'm curious to see what he does with it.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.080
 Kind of pumped for it now.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.080
 But yeah, he did Sicario, prisoners, arrival.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.600
 - Oh, oh.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.560
 - Which was also good.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.000
 I liked the sound and that one.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 Also very tense and just like ambient throughout, you know what I mean?

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.240
 - That movie was the shit, by the way.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.080
 - Yeah.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.040
 - I just watched it recently.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.560
 Like I was just watching a bunch of movies in the middle of the night

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.520
 and like a few of them happened to be scored by him.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.600
 And I was like, okay.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.960
 And I didn't find that out until like after the fact, you know what I mean?

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.600
 Like every time I watched a movie in soundtrack sticks with my head,

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.280
 I always try to look it up afterwards.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.440
 Like I did that and a couple times I was like, oh, it's this guy again.

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.440
 Like, you know what I mean?

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.280
 It's like cool.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.840
 I'm not surprised.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.520
 - I'll say to piggyback off that to David Lynch

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.920
 killing it with sound effects work for the new Twin Peaks.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.760
 - Absolutely.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.760
 - He's doing it himself.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760
 - Yeah.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.760
 - Apparently he's doing all of that.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.480
 He still has Angelo but elementi helping with the scores and things.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.080
 You can tell all the parts that are like sound design-y,

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.080
 drone-ier stuff.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.080
 He's crushing it.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.080
 - Oh, yeah.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.080
 - I mean, his eraser head.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.080
 - I was just going to say, his eraser head.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.080
 - His eraser head, yeah.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.720
 - The sounds is what made eraser head, in my opinion.

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.720
 - Yeah.

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:50.720
 - Not just the sound tracks, you know what I mean?

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:57.120
 Like the background noises, but like just like the, I guess the folly work also.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.840
 Like you can tell he's the one that makes the sound effects sometimes for things and

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.920
 it's just always like kind of loud.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:04.920
 You know what I mean?

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.920
 Like it does, very interesting distorted sounds all the time.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:08.920
 Like episode eight.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:09.920
 - Oh, yeah.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:10.920
 - You know what I mean?

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:16.560
 All the weird distorted sounds and like when the fucking miners are talking and their voices

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:21.560
 are all like electrified and scrambled but still like coherent.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.560
 I'm like, that is a good effect.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.560
 - Yeah, or like in Blue Velvet when it's starting to zoom into the ground.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.640
 - Yeah, the ground and all the fucking worms and shit.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:30.640
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.880
 - Yeah, I almost forgot about that part rewatching and I was like, oh right.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.720
 This is kind of like, he's always carried that thread through.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.320
 - Yeah, I love that scene.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.320
 - Yeah.

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.240
 - Like the opening scene of the opening scene of Blue Velvet?

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.240
 - Yes.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.840
 - I always forget that that happens.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.840
 - Yeah.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.440
 - Like the dude has like a heart attack or something.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.440
 - Uh huh.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.000
 - And then it's gardening as long.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.720
 That scene is always embedded in my scope.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.720
 - I forget that.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.320
 Like every time I'm always like, holy shit, that's how this fucking movie starts.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.880
 I totally forget that every time.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.560
 - 'Cause I grew up in Crafton.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.560
 You know what I mean?

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.840
 And that opening scene always reminds me of like Crafton and when I'd be like all out

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.960
 of my mind wandering the streets of Crafton, there's all these happy fucking families and

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.600
 these old dudes watering their lawn and shit.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.600
 You know, like on the surface, you know, everything's the perfect fucking, you know,

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.880
 suburban town and then like, you know.

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.880
 - Underneath the dirt.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.880
 - Yeah.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.040
 - You know, where all the fucking bugs are out of sight.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.280
 - You were Crafton's Frank.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.280
 - Yes.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.440
 - Yeah, that was me.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.440
 Candy color, come on.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.640
 - I was sitting around in my wheelchair, I remember what those were called.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.640
 - Wonderful in Chasim modular.

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.640
 - That's a good question.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.640
 - That's a good question.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.640
 - I don't want to know that.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.600
 - I don't even know what his gear is.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.760
 I mean, there's no famous piece of gear tied to him.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.760
 - Right.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.760
 - If he doesn't, he should have one.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.760
 - Yeah.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.760
 - He would love it.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.760
 - He would love it.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.560
 - He probably just goes to Trent, the governor's studio.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.560
 - Probably everything there.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.960
 Trent, I'm looking to make a sound.

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.440
 - You're reminding me.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.360
 - That reminds me of electricity.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:05.560
 Trent, can I come to New Orleans and play in your studio?

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.680
 (motor revving)

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.420
 (motor revving)

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:41.960
 - This sweeps bring all the voltages to the ground plane.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.300
 (laughing)

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:44.800
 - Oh, geez, Christ.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.060
 (groaning)

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.400
 - Fuck.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.000
 - Oh, so many extra syllables.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.740
 (laughing)

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:53.580
 - Oh, God.
