00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.700
 [Music]

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.260
 Episode 27, "Cisex Dumpster Reunion"

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.060
 Out and about, back in the flesh, in my backyard.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.420
 Kind of. We're still pretty far apart.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.300
 Yeah. Socially distanced. Mm-hmm.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.020
 Just close enough.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.020
 Yep.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.580
 Better than a discord.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.420
 So that was cool when we needed to do it that way,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.420
 but it's, you know, as we were talking.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.420
 It's not the best way to roll.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.340
 No, no, it's not.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.500
 Although, again, going back to what we talked about,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.100
 I'm still having a little bit of trouble

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.780
 getting used to being around people.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.260
 Yeah.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
 Because I was pretty bad at it before.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.980
 Uh, quarantine and, you know, now I'm really out of practice.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.260
 So like, I'm trying to make eye contact with the two of you,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.060
 but the second I see you, I'm like, "Oh, God, no.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.100
 You're gonna have to look down."

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.060
 I even mentioned it earlier.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.380
 I was like, I was excited to do this episode.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.460
 There was a lot on, you know, that I wanted to talk about,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.100
 but as it got nearer, like, my social anxiety started creep

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.060
 and up, and I started like, have like a mild anxiety attack

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.900
 as a thought of like getting together to do this.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.860
 And I was like, "What the fuck?

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.780
 I'm like so out of touch, dude."

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.180
 And like, yeah, but you're doing great.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.980
 I'm trying.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.180
 I'm working on it.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.740
 Yeah.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 So that would explain to our listeners why there's crickets.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.900
 Yeah, you're gonna hear some crickets on occasion?

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.700
 Probably some dogs.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.060
 A dog barking.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.500
 A jet plane going overhead from time to time.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.460
 Temperature is perfect.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.460
 It's way too warm for an end of October day.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.860
 Yeah, we couldn't have picked a better day, I think,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.260
 to come together in the meat space for the first time

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.140
 in almost a year.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.820
 And your neighbors have a, like, not a bad Halloween

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.700
 front yard setup.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.340
 That's all right.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.660
 Yeah.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.660
 Got some spider webs, got some little light show,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.540
 with some pumpkins.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.220
 There's a lot of good ones on the street.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.100
 And I've been doing all my walks at night,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.060
 and yeah, I've been stumbling across a few houses

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.580
 that I'm actually impressed with the amount of effort.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.140
 I guess people are bored.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.940
 You know what I mean?

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.420
 Yeah.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.420
 People are just going all in for Halloween.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.140
 There's nothing else you can really do for Halloween,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.380
 aside from, like, decorate your house right now.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.900
 I decorated this year.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.300
 You really?

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.580
 The CSA, they gave, like, a pumpkin,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.780
 to, like, make a pumpkin pie,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.700
 and I just sat it on the front porch.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.980
 Did you carve it?

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.460
 Fuck no.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.340
 I got three of them on my porch right now.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.220
 I grabbed it.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.420
 I ain't gonna carve them,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.300
 but they're there.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.660
 I contributed.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.220
 Hey.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.100
 So this decoration could easily be mistaken for garbage.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.060
 And these fuckers,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.420
 as you can see them two doors down,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.140
 had a one-up with, like, the biggest pumpkin I've seen.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.500
 Oh, shit.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.100
 Yeah, that's gigantic.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.420
 Just trying to one-up everyone.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.340
 Projections.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.540
 Fancy.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.540
 Yeah, that's one I've been staring at since I sat down.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.820
 Nautic.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.500
 It is, and it's sufficiently random, like,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.420
 kind of.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.260
 I'm starting to see maybe some repeating patterns.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.100
 I think it's just a bunch of circles.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.300
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.140
 There's a house down the street has projections,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.100
 it's words.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.380
 And when I was walking the other night,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.340
 it just said creep.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.580
 It was to you.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.820
 I know.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.180
 I was like, that's appropriate.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.820
 How you doing?

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.900
 It just said, "Ainlingus."

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.660
 I'm impressed I could have that many letters.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.020
 Dirty boy walking around at 2 a.m.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.100
 looking to sniff some toes.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.580
 That was the weirdest one.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.780
 I was like, what the hell?

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.820
 It's like this thing knows me.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.660
 Three of them and chain them together.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.900
 Off to a good start.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.580
 So you can't get this type of interaction through Discord.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.660
 We've got to be in person for this shit.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.180
 So the electronic music equipment.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.180
 [laughter]

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.900
 So how long is everyone's lists?

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.900
 I've got a few things.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.660
 I feel like I probably have the shortest list.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.940
 So it doesn't seem to make sense for me to go first.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.740
 Greg, how long is your list?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.780
 You said you had a lot.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.820
 Not a lot.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.620
 Just I had like three main topics,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.620
 but I felt like I was passionate enough about them

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.620
 that it would stir some probably lengthy conversation.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.540
 The first I wanted to discuss with you guys was

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.020
 what type of plants should I put next to my modular

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.700
 to make it sound the most lush?

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.820
 Cacti or succulent?

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.860
 I mean, is it the plant that's the most important

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.460
 or is it the pot that it's in?

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.500
 I think that's a good question.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.460
 That's a good question.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.900
 There's a lot going on here.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.300
 First you've got to go to a synthesis and shady side.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.220
 You've got to get a pot.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.340
 Doesn't matter what plant.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.740
 We'll figure that out, but you've got to get something

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.540
 fucking dope.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.940
 Right.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.500
 Right.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.980
 Texture.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.820
 Like well over $50 for the pot.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.380
 Handcrafted, artisan pot.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.620
 Tasteful colors.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.660
 Hand blown glass.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.020
 But like it can't be too perfect.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.780
 Because then it looks like some sheet made.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.380
 Yeah, a little bit of asymmetry.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.740
 A little one perfection.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.860
 A little chip in the top of it.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.460
 It's not the 50s.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.020
 It really speaks to me as a person

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.820
 and represents my modular and my lush ambient drones.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.340
 You got to talk about the wood cream of the table underneath it.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.820
 Yeah.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.100
 And what it was stained with.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.460
 Well, of course.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.820
 I mean, you just go get a wood table.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.940
 What are you?

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.900
 Some fucking amateur?

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.740
 Poser.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.060
 Yeah.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.420
 What kind of oxygen are you pumping into the room?

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.740
 To make it pure, you know.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.620
 And how does that reflect the lighting choices that you've made it?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.260
 Have you even thought about your lighting situation?

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.380
 I better not be fluorescent.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.780
 I have not.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.820
 See, I guess I was focusing on the wrong thing this entire time.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.060
 I was more or less focusing on the plant, but

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.460
 it's everything around the plant that matters.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.700
 It's layers.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.020
 Like I've got a cake.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.660
 Yeah.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.860
 Fucked up design cake.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.620
 Oh shit.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.460
 Yeah, it's succulent.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.860
 Yeah.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.580
 I mean, probably.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.380
 Over cacti.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.780
 Yeah.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.980
 Cacti a little too harsh, huh?

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.180
 Too pretty.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.980
 Doesn't represent.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.180
 Lush.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.580
 You're not.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.740
 Yeah.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.020
 It's not smooth.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.460
 You can't pet it easily.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.260
 Right, right.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.020
 And the fern is just too ferny.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.500
 You know, it doesn't say lush.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.300
 Anyway, could do that.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.780
 Yeah.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.220
 I mean, unless it's a fern that goes up to the top and sort of like

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.980
 come with some of the leaves like are over top of the cables.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.300
 That gives it that sort of vibe of like,

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.900
 are you in the woods or not?

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.180
 Is this like a module?

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.500
 Is it like blending with the modular?

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.700
 That's the kind of fern you want.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.180
 Exactly.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.620
 Is where does nature begin?

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.060
 Nature begin and man ends.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.180
 That's the question that fern asks, man.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.260
 Is it triggering the gates or is it the flux?

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.660
 It sounds natural and beautiful.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.780
 Plantasia.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.180
 Lush.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:28.380
 Lush is the new analog.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.060
 Is the new fat?

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.780
 I've noticed on forums and on YouTube,

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.140
 comments, everyone's talking about the lushness of their patches.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.860
 It just kind of makes me Google.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.060
 It's funny though that it actually is like,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.660
 I thought fat was bad enough.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.140
 Mm-hmm.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.540
 And the fact that I'm like, I kind of miss fat.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.100
 Yeah.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.900
 Like, yeah.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.740
 I think I prefer fat over lush.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.700
 I definitely do too.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.180
 Yeah.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:55.420
 Yeah.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.220
 Nothing about anything against lush sounds,

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.060
 but just a lot of things that aren't all that lush

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.620
 but are being pushed as lush.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.140
 It's like, okay.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.020
 When did the modular demo become ASMR?

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.700
 Yeah.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.500
 That's a good question.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.460
 That is a good question, yeah.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.580
 There's an abundance of that stuff.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.060
 Yeah.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.060
 No more like technical demos or like patches

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.580
 that show off a variety of sounds.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.220
 It's all about like the lushness.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.300
 It's like being in that reverb.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.620
 Do you feel the fucking reverb around you?

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.820
 That's what I hear about.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.540
 Let it wash over you like a warm bath.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:34.780
 Yeah.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.580
 Listen to that single sine wave oscillator

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.100
 drone on through clouds.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.420
 Yeah.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.100
 Opie 1 next to it, of course.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:47.420
 Yeah.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.020
 I have seen a lot of Opie 1s in, uh,

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:51.740
 they're everywhere.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.380
 Yeah.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.900
 I don't know if they've come down in price

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.980
 or if that's just the tools of the trade now

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.100
 to achieve lushness.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:57.980
 Yeah.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.620
 But, uh.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.100
 Or maybe just to take up a lot of screen real estate

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:01.900
 in your video.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.220
 Yeah.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.500
 Maybe that's what it is.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:03.900
 Oh, shit.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.700
 That's true.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.380
 That probably has a lot to do with it.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.580
 Things that'll fit in the frame.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:07.900
 Right.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.900
 Hmm.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.260
 I bet you're right.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
 We've talked about doing interviews.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.740
 Maybe we should get someone who makes

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.820
 these type of videos and they can come on.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.380
 And, uh, you know, like walk us through it.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.260
 Give us a primer.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.180
 We clearly don't know what we're doing.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:23.980
 We're out of our depth.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.820
 We could use some advice.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.860
 And so could our listeners.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.100
 I assume if they're listening to this,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.700
 instead of watching one of those videos,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.860
 they're dirt bags and need some advice.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.420
 I don't think all the patches sound the same.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.060
 The fucking YouTube thumbnails all look the same.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.020
 To the point where I got confused as to

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.500
 which videos I've watched and which ones I haven't the other day.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.100
 I was just trying to look into,

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.980
 I don't even remember what it was.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.620
 It was a reverb of some sort.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.540
 And it just brought up like all these different

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.580
 YouTube videos that had like the same screenshot.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.220
 Plant next to a modular, maybe an OP1 tucked in the corner

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.340
 on a wood grain table.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.260
 - Where's the Pam's do you work out again?

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.140
 - Oh, there it is.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:04.620
 - There it is.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.980
 Straight top down perspective from the camera.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.780
 - Exactly.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:14.060
 'Cause that replaced the at an angle in front of a window

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.940
 overlooking a beautiful vista on a cloudy day.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:17.420
 - Sadly.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.500
 I think this was mainly from like light bath

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.500
 and red means recording starting this trend.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.420
 And now like everyone is just writing on their coattails

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.220
 trying to simulate the same type of YouTube videos.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:30.620
 - Agreed.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.580
 - But I'm not necessarily complaining

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.260
 it's just something I've observed lately.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.220
 - Especially in quarantine, it's been a thing.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.380
 - Yeah, and I started to question my own setup.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.660
 I'm like, can I achieve that level of lush?

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.220
 I just don't think I can.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:48.700
 - Yeah.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.380
 - Have I tried?

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.180
 Probably not.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.100
 But if I did, I don't think it would add up to these guys.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.260
 - No.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.820
 - I need more succulents.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.420
 - That's why we should have somebody on.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.780
 It's like it guide us.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.620
 We don't want to make mistakes.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.260
 - Back in my day, you just had a cat next to your module.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.700
 And you were holding the camera with your hands.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.740
 It was slightly shaky.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.940
 - Hand held, shaky.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.620
 Sample and hold, computer beep-op module going off.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.460
 You know, just random bleeps and bloops.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.980
 An occasional Richard Divine fart in there somewhere.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.660
 - There was a protocol when we all stuck to it.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.980
 - Times of changing.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.740
 - Yeah, we're getting left behind.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.900
 - You though, you should put holes in your ceiling

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.980
 that will let blood drip down the walls

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.060
 with certain gates that you trigger.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.100
 And then when a guy gets old,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.380
 you can then the black paint fluid comes up.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.900
 - Obviously, and that's the end of the video.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.220
 - Yeah.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.260
 - I like it.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.580
 - Match with the jack and cable scheme.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.900
 So yeah, how is that flux sequencer?

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.980
 Is that something you want to dig into this episode?

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:48.860
 - I do.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.980
 I'll say that for later though.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.380
 - Okay.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:50.700
 Yeah.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.820
 - I can understand.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.660
 - I was reading about it today.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:53.980
 - Yeah.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.100
 I'll probably say that for last on my list at least.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.820
 - Did you get a quadrax?

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.780
 - I did.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.700
 - Oh, it's awesome.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.180
 - Very jealous.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.220
 - Yeah, it's on my list too.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.340
 - I don't have a, you just want to dive into that.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:07.740
 - Yeah.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.700
 - Go for it.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.980
 - I don't have a whole lot to say about it off the top.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.580
 Like I've only started to dig into the behind the scenes

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.380
 functions on it just last night actually.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.900
 - What would, what would,

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.700
 - Don't we interrupt?

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.420
 - Yes, yes.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.220
 - Let's introduce what you're talking about.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.740
 - IntelliJil quadrics.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.700
 It's quad envelope generator.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.380
 - And this is the next generation

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.140
 after the original quadra.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.900
 And it sort of combines both the quadra

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.140
 and the expander they had for the quadra

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.220
 and new things on top of that.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.220
 - Well, there was an expander for the original quadra too.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.460
 - There was, and it was about as big as the quadra.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.420
 - It was so massive.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.780
 - Yeah, I missed that.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.740
 - That's why I never got it.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.660
 I have a quadra, but I never got the expander

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.660
 because it was literally almost as big.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.380
 - Huh.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.020
 - Yeah.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.100
 So okay, so go on to the quadracks.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.700
 - I got it mainly as a companion to my flux.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.340
 I wanted more envelopes because that thing just kind of,

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.340
 it's like peas and carrots, generating envelopes with the flux.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.700
 I knew you spoke highly of it.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.220
 So I was like, all right, I'll give it a shot.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.580
 And yeah, I'm using it in like every patch now over the last week.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:13.980
 - Same.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.220
 - Even just with the surface level functions,

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.100
 it's pretty great as a standard envelope generator.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.540
 It does LFO bursts, which I think is fucking awesome.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:24.540
 - Awesome.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.220
 - Yeah, the version is really cool.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.820
 - Especially with the flux.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.460
 - Yeah.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.540
 And, but it has a bunch of behind the scene stuff too

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.300
 that maybe you've tapped into a bit more of a--

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.020
 - A little bit.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.980
 Like I haven't fucked with the modulation matrix too much,

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.100
 even though I've modulated and know I'm starting to remember

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.380
 the modes a little bit enough,

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.820
 which things will take attack versus decay and things like that.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.020
 One of my favorite things is just sending like the top channel

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.340
 trigger and then having the rest of them just like

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.380
 different modulations using that trigger at different like offset.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.780
 So you get like four different fucked up modulators.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.500
 - That's the one thing I haven't--

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.580
 Oh my god, who's honking their horn?

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.740
 - Someone's a car alarm.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.580
 - We did not guess this on the list of things

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.540
 that was going to interrupt us.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.740
 - We didn't say car horn.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.060
 - Shit.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:08.780
 - Goddamn that.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.580
 - What's--

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.780
 - Let's give that a second.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.860
 - Hear that everyone?

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.420
 - I still don't know why people fuck car alarms and pointless.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.100
 - I saw someone in the parking lot the other day still had a club

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.220
 on their fucking steering wheel.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.340
 I was like, are you shitting me?

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.300
 Like what year is this?

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.140
 But any who--

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.740
 Yeah, that was--

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.820
 That's actually the one thing I haven't dove into is

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.940
 the daisy chaining of the channels.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.340
 I've fucked around with like the modulation matrix a little bit

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.620
 and it's pretty sweet.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.660
 It's definitely not something I'm going to memorize anytime soon though.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.140
 - Same here.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.540
 - I'm going to have to like constantly refer to the manual.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.220
 - So those of us who don't have this,

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.980
 what is this modulation matrix and how do you configure it?

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.900
 - Basically each channel has a CV in that you can route to

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.580
 any parameter and I think any channel.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.220
 - Yeah, each channel.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.740
 - So you can have like one channel with like four CV inputs going to it if you want.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.220
 - Oh wow.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.300
 - And it's all done with like key combos.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.860
 There's no like surface level way of configuring this.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.140
 - So what are the destinations?

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:10.780
 Attack.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.340
 - There's a lot.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.220
 - Yeah.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.220
 - Attack to K like speed of the modulation if it's an LFO mode.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.300
 I think the shape of the modulator.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.420
 - But it's pretty cool.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.500
 I don't know.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.460
 I didn't know that I needed another function generator,

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.980
 but I'm glad that I got it.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.860
 - Yeah, it's a great one.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.500
 And at first like I had a weird experience with it and that I got it.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.420
 I was like, oh, I almost wish I had the quadra because it's that quadra is flat.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.740
 You know, there's no complexity to it really.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:37.740
 - Right.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.540
 - But then if you just push through to understand the colors a little bit,

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.820
 then it becomes a little clearer.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.740
 And sometimes if you don't know, it's just like,

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.420
 it's a color until it does what you would expect it to do kind of thing.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.340
 So it's just pushing through it.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.740
 It became much more useful to me.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:57.420
 - How does it respond to getting a gate while it's in still within the function?

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.100
 Like how does it handle being interrupted?

00:15:59.100 --> 00:15:59.980
 - That's different.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.740
 There's actually under the hood things that you can change in regard to that too.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.300
 - Oh cool.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.380
 - Like burst mode, for example.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.500
 If you go into the hidden menu, it's like a hidden global menu.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:17.980
 You can change, by default, the left knob will be changing the pulse width of the burst,

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.780
 but there's a secret mode you can get into where it's going to change,

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.820
 where it's going to like re-trigger the burst instead of doing that when it receives a new gate.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.220
 - Gotcha.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.140
 - So yeah, it's all dependent on the mode and what global options you have.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.260
 It gets pretty deep.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:31.980
 - Yeah.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.340
 Damn.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.460
 - And it's not that much bigger than the original quadra.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.020
 I may be getting rid of my quadra.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:41.260
 - Yeah.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:41.900
 - That sounds amazing.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.020
 Did you get the expander?

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.740
 - I didn't know it existed until I was reading the manual.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.860
 I was like, oh, okay.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.900
 - It's fun, but it's not essential at all, I would say.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.300
 It's nice in that I have a source of like all these gates that are triggered to the rise and

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.780
 fall of these envelopes or these modulators, right?

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.580
 But is it crucial now?

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.500
 I would take it out if I needed space.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.980
 It's not mandatory.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.340
 It's just, I'm nice.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.700
 - Yeah, I might get it in the future.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.300
 As I have that row configured currently though, it's like maxed out.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:12.860
 - Right.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:20.620
 - It's 84 HP across and it fit exactly an eloquencer, the flux sequencer, and the quadrics.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.740
 - Oh, that's sick.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.580
 - It filled up the whole row and I was like, that's perfect.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:23.980
 - Yeah.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:24.460
 - Yeah.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:29.900
 But anything ever gets shifted around and I can squeeze the expander and I'll probably get it.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.540
 - Wow, so it sounds like you're sold.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.620
 - Yeah, no regrets so far.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.100
 - Same.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.180
 - Still a lot of exploring I need to do with it though.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.940
 - Are they updating it frequently or is this basically what you have?

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.980
 - I don't know.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.940
 I haven't checked.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:43.900
 - Yeah, I haven't checked.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:49.980
 I mean, IntelliJel isn't really known for pumping out firmware updates unless there's like a crucial bug to fix.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:57.020
 Like even the Rainmaker, you'd think that would be a module that would be getting a lot of like

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.900
 add-ons and things like that, but I think it's only received like one major update over time.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:07.500
 I never had a Rainmaker. I always just kind of assumed there was this like secret thread of

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.340
 updates to Rainmaker.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.340
 - Yeah, I'm not really thankful.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:11.740
 - Yeah.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.940
 - That is really surprising.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:21.500
 - Yeah, mostly just fixes to some additional like mod targets and other features like randomizing the randomizations, I think was a little later on.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.700
 - Yeah, plain.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.500
 That was on the list.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.380
 - That was on the list, yeah.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.020
 We called that one.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.540
 - You gotta, you re-upped on the Rainmaker.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.900
 - I did. Yeah, it's back in there.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.380
 - Nice.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.340
 - Yeah, I just, I missed it.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.900
 And now it's back in every patch again.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.380
 - Yeah.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.740
 - You know, there was a time where I was trying to trim down the, you know, the large modules in my rig.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.260
 - Well, I got rid of mine.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:51.180
 - And it was good for a while, but there's just nothing out there that really does what Rainmaker does.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:51.980
 - Yeah, I agree.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.940
 - You'd have to have a lot of modules to get there and it still wouldn't be the same way of doing it.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.580
 - Yeah.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.420
 So I missed it and now it's back.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.060
 - Did you get how used or how new?

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.700
 - I used.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:04.780
 - How do you use it?

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.100
 - Nice.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.540
 - Yeah, I did a trade, I think.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.260
 I can't remember for what exactly.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:18.300
 Yeah, I did a lot of rearranging with the modules over the last couple months since our last episode.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.660
 A lot of things have changed in there.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.380
 - I noticed.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.500
 - Yeah, because you've been posting videos on Instagram.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.340
 And at one point I was like, "Holy shit, I don't actually recognize this."

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:27.660
 - Yeah.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.900
 - Yeah, it's gotten a lot of renovations.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.740
 - You mentioned that you got some carbons.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:38.620
 Mine now is in basically every patch.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.860
 I fucking love it.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.180
 How are you warming up to them?

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.620
 It sounds like you got a lot of them.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.820
 - I got all that I could get, which was one.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.420
 - What?

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.860
 - They are gone, dude.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.780
 They've been out of stock for months.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:58.380
 The only one that I did get popped up used on muffs and I grabbed it within 10 minutes of it popping up.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.180
 Yeah, it's just insanely out of stock at the moment.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.620
 - Oh, that's a bummer.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:12.300
 - It's everything I liked about the Polaris initially in a quarter of the size

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.220
 and with more functionality and more flexibility.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.540
 Instead of just on off the asymmetrical distortion on the Polaris,

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:25.020
 you instead have three saturation modes and an optional fucking wave folder.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:31.340
 Also remember, that saturation, that's just the button for those different modes.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.980
 You can send CV at whatever level you want.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:39.420
 You actually have more granular control over that saturation control.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:46.220
 It's just the button gives you off quarter 75, 100.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.460
 But if you want to send it CV, you can.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.060
 You can send it an offset you can.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:55.980
 Yeah, you have pretty good control over it outside of just those modes.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.020
 - Yeah, I think WMD knocked it out of the park with this one.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.420
 Like, not only does it sound good, which is the most important thing when it comes to a filter,

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.740
 in my opinion, and the resonance is nice, which kind of wasn't on the Polaris.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.140
 I always kept the resonance kind of scaled back because it just didn't do it for me.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:19.020
 But you got your multi-out four pole and then your individual outs

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:24.300
 all crammed into 4HP with wave shaping and all that on top of it.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.100
 That was such a nice extra feature to just toss in there.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:34.140
 I feel like, yeah, it's a workhorse and it's going to be like, in my opinion,

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.060
 an essential tool.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.140
 You know what I mean, in any compact setup.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:43.740
 And I was even talking about that last time and the idea of that is now in my live setup,

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.980
 the concept of a live setup now that's going to be kind of funny.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:53.580
 But when I was using it, I'm like, this is that missing piece that this is the stuff I wanted for

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.940
 live modular that I didn't know until I got it.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.220
 It just lines up so perfectly, especially being able to switch modes,

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.620
 having that different like, sort of like hold it until you want to.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.260
 I mean, it clearly put just an incredible amount of thought into it.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.340
 I'm still impressed, even though I already said I was impressed last time.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.780
 Yeah, it was your review that sold me on giving it a shot, you know.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.740
 I was so bad, like, whenever I encouraged someone to get something in there,

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.100
 like, oh, that was terrible.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.940
 At first, I was like, I don't need another filter.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.740
 And then I thought due to the size that it would probably suck.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.700
 You know what I mean?

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.500
 I just could not envision like a really good sounding filter in like a 4HP package.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.060
 How many are there?

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.820
 But one, that one.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:32.300
 Right.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:34.460
 Yeah.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:45.100
 But eventually, my plan is to get three more so that each BIA has its own dedicated filter/waveshaper/saturation.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.340
 I'm excited for it.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.780
 But yeah, out of stock.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.980
 Yeah, that's a bummer.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.420
 Because you talked about it, Dave.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:53.900
 Yeah.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.180
 Then everyone bought it up.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.060
 My influencer.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:56.380
 Yep.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.500
 You're an influencer now.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.500
 Get up, WND.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.980
 Get them free carbons.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.620
 Even if I just got a sticker, that'd be cool.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:15.180
 Speaking of WMD doing cool shit, they finally are releasing black panels separately.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:15.500
 Yeah.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:15.980
 That's all that.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.540
 All their stuff.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.340
 Yeah, that's cool.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.060
 Yeah.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:26.220
 So my silver trash master that has been an eyesore in my rig for years now will soon be black.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.260
 Very excited about that.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.620
 So like, IntelliJale, you want to make like a million dollars?

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.940
 Like, easy money IntelliJale.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.780
 I know there's probably holostatic things, but yeah, then the knobs won't match.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.300
 And like, all this shit, like, just like a black panel.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.260
 I don't have your knobs on there anyway.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:39.420
 Yeah.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.620
 I already switched those out.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.180
 Don't worry about it.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.540
 Make the black panels.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.820
 Or should we just start that business?

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.180
 What?

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.940
 Everyone has, and then they stop doing it.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.180
 Yeah.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.620
 You're going to sue us IntelliJale?

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.420
 This is like a...

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.340
 This is like, come at me, bro.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.140
 It's like a phone call.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.420
 You don't respond, we can do it.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.940
 Oh, I see.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.500
 You didn't say not to do it.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.700
 If they're going to do anything,

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.140
 I would really like to start remaking some of those 1U modules

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.700
 that they can't seem to make enough of.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.500
 This is for sure.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.060
 On top of making some black panels, but...

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.140
 For the 1U modules.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.340
 And every other one.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.780
 Yeah, the only other WMD silver modules I have are the Pro outputs.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.780
 And I messaged them about that, and they said that those will be available in a couple weeks.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:23.340
 Well, that's cool.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.060
 They go all the way back to like the Hadron Collider and like...

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:26.780
 I don't know.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.260
 Gamma-wave.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.340
 But there's a lot available right now, just out of nowhere.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.500
 And for a while, they said they weren't going to do that.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.060
 Right, right.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:38.140
 You know, like, they're like, yeah, we're offering black versions moving forward.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.820
 That's a wrap we're not offering separated panels, which bum me out.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.860
 And then I just happened to look at their website to see when...

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.100
 If carbons were in stock, and then I stumbled upon a whole section of black panels now,

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:49.900
 and I was like, holy shit.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.740
 Well, even like the...

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.660
 Because I mean, a lot of the new modules have come out with black panels,

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.020
 and their video is like a...

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:04.460
 You know, that sort of like, make noise black panel style, and it looks... boss.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:04.780
 Yeah.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.780
 So it's a really good aesthetic.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:11.420
 And Erika, Erika had that techno system that they were using for a lot of their demos.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.100
 It just looks cooler.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:13.580
 It looks good.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.420
 It's easier on the eyes too.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.740
 Yeah, also, yeah, the five-use systems are black.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.340
 It just looks a lot better.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:24.140
 Can't imagine like a big white five-use system that's like fucking disgusting.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.380
 I got a black BIA, and super glad.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.820
 Like, I can't believe that I thought I didn't need a BIA for a while,

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.340
 because it's just that fucking crucial.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.940
 But man, those jacks suck.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.860
 Yeah, I'm sorry, but those are really tough to the point where I'm like,

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.100
 oh, is the module like...

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.060
 Is the module broken?

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.700
 What's going on?

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.180
 It's not working.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.900
 It's like, oh no, I just needed to like really push it in a lot harder,

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.740
 because it wasn't in all the way.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.220
 And it's like...

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:52.300
 So those are the same shitty jacks that are on the Versio.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.420
 Right.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.460
 That I don't like.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:26:01.900
 And I guess, at least from what people were saying on the forums,

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.820
 what are they called?

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.500
 People that like build modules for people.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.020
 Builders.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:09.500
 Builders.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:09.900
 Yeah.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:15.020
 It's a specific place that is doing that called ElectroSmith.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.620
 Oh, they make modules.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.100
 Yeah.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.940
 Well, apparently ElectroSmith made these latest noise engineering ones,

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.300
 and all the latest ones like the BIA and the Versio feature those jacks.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.100
 And a lot of people seem to be unhappy with them.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.580
 And at first, I was engineering saying like they just need broken in.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.300
 But I've been putting my Versio through its paces, and those jacks still suck.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:34.620
 Yeah.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.660
 I even tried like they're like, "Angle the jack."

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.260
 And then move it through.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:39.980
 And I like did that.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.860
 And I'm like, okay, this is 0% better at this point.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.100
 Right.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.700
 To your point of probably bent this jack a little, which I don't care about, but...

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.380
 Yeah, I almost knocked my modular over trying to plug something into it.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.540
 Because you know, my cases are like freestanding.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:52.860
 Yeah.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.140
 Like it just wouldn't go in.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:54.860
 I was like, what the fuck?

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.020
 Like I have to grip the back of the case to push it in the rest of the way.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:05.260
 And I have a module from Cubit, the surface.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:05.980
 Same thing.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.340
 Those jacks are the same way now.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.180
 And their stuff wasn't like that previously.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.340
 So maybe they're also going through ElectroSmith.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.060
 I don't know.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.820
 Someone made some cheap jacks.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:14.060
 Yeah.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.580
 And someone even pointed out on muffs, they were like, look, this...

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.460
 about the Versio.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.060
 They're like, this module is like a 400 bucks.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.980
 That's by no means cheap.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:27.100
 So like, why do these knobs feel like the cheapest worst knobs money can buy?

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.140
 But yeah, I have to agree.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.580
 So wait, how are you using yours?

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.780
 Like a synthesizer.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.940
 Yeah, so you're using it as part of a drum setup.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.100
 That's the main purpose.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.340
 But yeah, I use them for synth lines too.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.300
 I use them for everything.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.580
 That's why I decided to get four of them.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.660
 Because in my opinion, they're a fucking Swiss army knife.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.140
 Yeah.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.380
 I mean of like sonic potential.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.100
 They nailed it.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.460
 Well, that classic.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:56.460
 Wait, what other parts do you have for your drum machine?

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.780
 Your modular drum machine?

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.540
 Well, like I was saying, the BIA is the flux as like the heart of it.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:07.260
 The carbon and I'm using other filters now in place of,

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.220
 you know, a lack of other carbons.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.780
 You still have like a handful of plots though, right?

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.180
 Yes.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:13.660
 Yeah.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.500
 And I'm using those not so much in my drum machine setup.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.220
 Those are just more like synth stuff that I'm doing.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.140
 Things like that.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.460
 You used to rock the FM mode on those quite a bit.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.260
 I did.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.620
 And in the last record that I finished, that's on there heavy.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:35.180
 The FM mode, I was using the plats and FM mode quite a bit.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.700
 Wait, Craig, what records are you talking about?

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.060
 It doesn't have a name yet.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.580
 Oh, wait, I figured how about this, the one you put out.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.700
 No, that's talking about the split with Kevin.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.220
 Oh, I think I'm about the stress signal.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:48.460
 No.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:53.980
 Dude, I honestly, my brain was in a weird place when I made the stress signal

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.540
 and I don't remember most of how I made it.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:03.180
 I'm happy with how it turned out, but I don't fucking remember

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.700
 what I did to make those two tracks to be honest.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.420
 To be like that.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:07.980
 Yeah.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.740
 But thank you.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.340
 You know, it's astounding.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:11.660
 Yeah.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.140
 No.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.060
 Yeah, I guess I can give a shameless plug.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.620
 I have a new album called Distress Signals,

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.620
 two track album out on Bandcamp.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:24.460
 The proceeds go to the Navajo Nation COVID relief fund

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.060
 and it's Pay What You Want.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:33.340
 And it was mastered by fellow Muffwiggler Hermitek mastering.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.420
 Check it out.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.660
 We'll put like a link.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.740
 Okay, I say that now, but realistically, we're probably going to fuck this up

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:42.620
 and put it up.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.100
 Bandcamp.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:43.660
 We never promote that.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.540
 No, we don't.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.540
 We're horrible at self-promoting ourselves,

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.980
 so I'm just going to do it.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:48.860
 Yeah, do it.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:49.580
 Yeah.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.540
 Bandcamp.com/disheveledbeats.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:56.700
 Is that Disheveledbeats all one word?

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.740
 I think so.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.020
 That's why I recompt him again.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.020
 There's an underscore.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.140
 There might be.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.060
 Do a Google search.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:04.940
 You'll find it.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.140
 It'd really be cool if you could embed a sound that when somebody was

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.140
 listening to your podcast, it would just populate a bunch of URLs or something like that.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.140
 Ooh.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.940
 You know, like some way to get like data across.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.500
 Right, right.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.900
 That was some of the more aggressive, faster stuff that I've been

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.260
 that I was working on.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:21.820
 That was fast.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.300
 Thank you.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.860
 Yeah, it was just like, that was all modular based from what I remember.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:33.340
 A lot of vector sequencing that record was like driving a lot of that.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.060
 That might have been pre-vector.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.020
 Be back here.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.020
 When I was doing most of that sequencing, honestly.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.100
 Um, fuck.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.220
 That was probably.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.740
 Was marbles maybe?

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.580
 No, that wasn't marbles.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.540
 So this is actually just pure speculation on your part.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:55.020
 I'm trying to remember what I had at that time that I was like really digging on.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.060
 Not in the dark lab.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:04.300
 It might have been BeatStep Pro and something else in the modular doing most of the sequencing.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.220
 I can't remember what the hell did I have before the vector?

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.300
 Can't fucking remember.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.580
 Oh.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.260
 Oh, the Erica.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.220
 The Erica one.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.660
 Yeah, with the with the clunky buttons.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:14.220
 That's what it was.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:14.940
 That's what it was.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.980
 That's what it was.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.140
 Yeah.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.860
 That was me digging in on that thing.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:24.540
 I could talk about the, uh, the acid saga and its conclusion.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.780
 Because you started talking about it last time.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.260
 I did.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.940
 And I thought I was done.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.780
 I thought I was just going to use what I had or maybe get the TBO3,

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:37.820
 which I won't do, but the, uh, someone, one of our listeners, um, shout out frozen reads,

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:44.940
 was like, check out the TT03, TTT 303 Mark II, which was from Cyclone, um, who, you know, used to,

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:49.580
 be kind of infamous for cloning shit back in the day, Cyclone the name, but any more now,

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.580
 they kind of, you know, I don't know.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.860
 I think they made a great product in the TT 303 Mark II.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.060
 Um, very high quality.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.820
 Like case, the case is really nice.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.700
 Um, it's got like a metal back panel.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.980
 It's like, I like the LEDs and the colors on it.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:11.180
 Um, it sounds fucking right for being twice the price of a TD3.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.420
 It completely fucking destroys it in my mind.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.940
 And then they actually somehow managed to like clone the sound that I'm going for.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.780
 And, uh, I don't know.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.380
 It's like just all sweet spots.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.620
 Um, I've loved it so far.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:28.540
 It has the nice benefit of having a draw oscillator output of, you know, pre filter,

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.020
 pre anything that you can send into the modular.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.860
 Um, it's got some nice functionality in the back, patching out like accent outputs,

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:41.180
 CV output, gate output between those, it's almost like having the modular 303 that I wanted.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.540
 If I can just take like, I was taking the raw oscillator output,

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:50.220
 putting it into the system 8810 module and filtering it again and layering it on top of the 303.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.300
 Or just like having those two weave within each other.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:57.340
 And it's like, okay, this is what I wanted with an XOX heart or something like in the modular anyway.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:57.980
 That's awesome.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.500
 I didn't know it had all those CV's.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.940
 That was, I thought that was going to be like, oh, it's got an oscillator output.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.900
 And it's like, no, that's actually one of the coolest fucking things about it.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:11.500
 Um, it's got swing, like it's got variable gate time for the steps.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.260
 It's got there are two buttons, one's called a mute and one's called hammer.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:20.860
 And, um, those, all they do is make slightly softer or the hammer like pushes the notes

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.700
 forward in the sequencer.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.100
 And it makes like fucked up crazy effects that no, no 303 has this.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.340
 Features that are like clone 303s.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.660
 Nor do they have the gate time feature.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.580
 I fucking love it.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.220
 Like it's-

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.500
 I saw that hammer button on here.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.780
 Take it over a 303.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.540
 Yeah, I had no idea what it was meant to do.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.700
 I just assumed it was like an accent or something.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.460
 Yeah, I thought it was kind of like it like,

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.380
 shoves the sequence forward a bit and that plus the accents makes it like,

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.980
 and you can record that.

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.420
 You can go into edit mode and just record the amount of that on each step.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:55.660
 It's all like, you can do like kind of classic step recording 303 style.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.980
 You can do the TB3 style where you can just real time input it.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.900
 The one thing is it doesn't have like a metronome out.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.540
 So you've got a good-

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.380
 and we're no more like indication of progress.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.460
 So you've got like, like, guess.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.500
 But I always have it like,

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.500
 slaved to a drum machine already.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.740
 So it's like, okay, this is no big deal.

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.540
 And I love programming 303s in like real time that way.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.980
 And then using those modifiers on top to layer it and fuck it up.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.780
 Like it's-

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.620
 Yeah, I like it.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.300
 I would rather have that than a 303.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.100
 I would rather like, it's almost the ultimate to me.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:25.980
 Wow.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.180
 Honestly, the only thing I could ask for is a CV input on the filter,

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.620
 which it turns out,

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.900
 if you read enough notes about modifying 303s,

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.180
 that that's like a sketchy thing to be able to-

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:37.740
 Oh, what's that?

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.620
 CV the filter.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.140
 Because of the way the electronics work,

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.660
 it's like there's going to be some slew.

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.100
 Sometimes it can fuck up other parts of the circuit I've read.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.940
 And it's just like something that's not generally known to work very well.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.060
 Okay.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.740
 But having that raw oscillator output and like being able to fuck that up,

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.300
 that like totally scratched the itch for me.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.380
 So I've decided that the TD3, which I still have,

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.740
 because I'm not going to bother to resell it and I kind of fucking

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.340
 fucked part of it up like the case.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:09.260
 I'm going to start modding it to be like all the mods for the devil fish stuff.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.060
 Oh, nice.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:10.860
 Why not?

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.260
 Yeah.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:11.420
 Yeah.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.700
 Like there's nothing-

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.340
 And you can do it all with like non-surface mount components.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:15.980
 So-

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.700
 Oh, that's cool.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.020
 Yeah.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.860
 And it seems like there's enough space in there.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.740
 But even at this point-

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.180
 Like I'm not going to spend time doing that.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.380
 Let's click a rainy day.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.900
 Yeah, a couple of years project or something like that.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.580
 Or if somebody would have a mod service, I would send it out gladly.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.660
 Just have it, you know, trick this out.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.620
 Just trick this out.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.020
 Yeah.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.140
 Do whatever you can to it.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:34.780
 Send it back.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:35.180
 Yeah.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:35.980
 That'd be cool.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.580
 Via TT3 or 3 Mark II.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.060
 Nails the sound, the functionality.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.100
 It's got MIDI sync.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.180
 So you don't have to fuck with like CV gate sync.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.380
 Um, it's just-

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:44.940
 I don't know.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:45.820
 They nailed it.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:46.060
 So-

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.780
 Yeah, Cyclone did a good job on that.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.540
 I think they actually did something more unique than just cloning it.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.940
 And um, let's go to 3-Year warranty.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.460
 I hope it lasts like-

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.340
 The weird thing like the AC adapter jack on it is also like the on-off switch.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:05.740
 It's like this really shitty switch like right above the jack itself.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:06.700
 And that just seems like,

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.180
 Oh, what do you-

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.660
 You've rated for like tens of switches, you know?

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.820
 Like this isn't going to last very long, but I'm not sweating it.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.820
 I so rarely even look or think about warranties on all the shit.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.140
 The fact that you said this had one, I was like,

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.860
 Do I have stuff that has warranty?

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.660
 Granted, they're probably all expired by now because-

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:26.860
 But whatever, but like I-

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.180
 That's a-

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.740
 Not something I really think about that, huh?

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:30.300
 That all then.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.020
 Yeah, because that one-

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.300
 The first version of that looked exactly like a 303.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.100
 To the point where I think Roland pressured them to make a different case.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.820
 Right.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.060
 That one had problems and had like noise issues

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.540
 and they actually fixed some of the noise issues in this one.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.220
 I thought there was slight noise,

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.900
 but that was just the headphone output.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.980
 And it turns out the fucking regular output is like-

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.500
 Perfect.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:49.820
 So.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.180
 Yeah.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.340
 Super psyched for like 300 bucks.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.140
 That was fucking-

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.420
 I wish I just would have gotten that one right out of the gate.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.900
 And that plus the TB3 is awesome.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.300
 That's like total dream scenario for me.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.420
 So.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.220
 Has it made you think about looking at some of the other stuff they offer?

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.140
 Yeah, I- I- I do-

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.820
 They do the CR78 clone and the 606 clone, but I don't-

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.340
 I'm not excited.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.260
 I've never been excited by the 606,

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:19.900
 um, unless there was somebody making one that could be changed a lot.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.780
 Like, and the new boutique one does not look appealing to me at all.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.740
 And then the CR78 was just like, uh, yeah.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.780
 Yeah, the same case is very similar,

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.900
 but the 303 of that case is fucking nailed it.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:32.380
 Nice.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.180
 That's awesome.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.660
 So- So is this- is this the end?

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.020
 Is this the end of the asset saga?

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:37.660
 Yeah.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:38.620
 I'm confident of that.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:46.700
 Did you see Mylar Melodies just posted a big video of his take on his modular dream 303 box?

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:47.180
 No.

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:50.060
 And if I recall it circles around the Zox Heartland,

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:53.420
 like the LS1 light strip that he was like using control.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.900
 If you're like- it was a real interesting video and made me think of you

00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:00.380
 because like your- your quest recently for the ultimate 303.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.260
 But um-

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.980
 I'll check that out.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.740
 Yeah, it was- it was a good- good watch.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.300
 Probably my favorite video from him in a minute.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:14.060
 But yeah, he just has like a- basically a one- you live 303 in a modular setup

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.980
 that just jams on for like 20 minutes.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.540
 Yeah.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.460
 And explains his thought logic behind it.

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.220
 By the way, Cosmo-Tronix?

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:22.860
 Cosmix.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:23.740
 All right.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:24.940
 I think it's Cosmo-Tronix.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.620
 I don't know why I keep putting an X in there.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.820
 It'd be cooler with an X.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.260
 Cosmo-Tronix?

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:29.900
 Cosmix.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.740
 AKA-

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.740
 Arl Enhancing Stereo Mixer.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.980
 Arl Enhancing.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.420
 Arl Enhancing.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.380
 Where are they from?

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.420
 Do you need Cosmo-Tronix?

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.060
 No fucking clue.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:40.460
 No clue.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:40.700
 Yeah.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.580
 Is anyone- have they done other modules before this?

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.180
 They have like a envelope.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.980
 I think called Delta V.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:48.940
 I might be getting that wrong.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:49.580
 Something like that.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.740
 But nothing that ever popped up on my radar.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.140
 Okay.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.580
 Before.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.540
 And either did this mixer.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.060
 I kind of stumbled upon it.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.460
 Wait, was it you were looking for something on modular grid?

00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.580
 And this is what popped up?

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:00.140
 Yes.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:05.580
 I was looking for the perfect mixer for my drum machine.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:05.980
 You know what I mean?

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.300
 I wanted something that had auxiliary sends

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.820
 and had like stereo onboard, things like that.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.820
 I was kind of tired of my Erika ones and they're kind of bulky

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.500
 and they don't have a lot of other features.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:19.980
 You know what I mean?

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:25.420
 And I stumbled upon this one and it apparently was like just released.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.380
 And I was like, okay.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.340
 So I was going through all the options that had four mono channels,

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.780
 which is what I needed right off the bat for my drum machine.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:37.420
 Had one auxiliary send and then it had two stereo inputs.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.820
 And I was like, okay, that's everything.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.140
 Yeah.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.660
 That's like perfect.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:42.700
 And then on top of it.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:49.100
 It working with it reminds me a lot of working with my old Mackey.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.620
 Every channel, even the stereo channels,

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.660
 anything past 50% line, like there's a white line,

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.020
 you're going past unity gain and into saturation.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.460
 Oh, that's awesome.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:00.540
 Yeah.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.820
 So each channel has its own saturation that you can do.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:10.300
 And then the master bus has a dual band maximizer.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.900
 Like the BBN maximizer?

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.460
 No, I'm sorry.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.740
 It's they call it a clipping diode distortion circuit

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:25.100
 with low end and high end frequency sliders that function like a dual band maximizer.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:29.340
 Yeah, you can disable this, but of course I have not.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:33.980
 It's constantly on and it's just really nice.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:39.980
 Like there's a lot of headroom in there before you reach any distortion on the channel and on the master bus.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:46.700
 And just messing with it, it can go on full on destructive distortion.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:51.020
 Or if you tweak it, there's some nice harmonic enhancing sweet spots.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:56.140
 And it's dual band, so you can fine tune that even further.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.100
 That's awesome.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.860
 Yeah, I'm really excited about it.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:04.300
 So in my opinion, just as a stereo distortion, it's kind of nice.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:04.620
 Yeah.

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:04.860
 You know what I mean?

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.420
 On top of being a very versatile mixer.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.260
 I liked it so much that I bought a second one.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.940
 Also, every channel has a clickless mute.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.780
 It has panning.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:17.260
 Nice.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:17.740
 Yeah.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:24.620
 And it has pre or post switches for the faders and the auxiliary send.

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:24.860
 Yeah.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.500
 It's a lot packed in there.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.820
 I think it sounds great.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.020
 And I haven't found any other mixer like it.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:33.580
 You know what I mean?

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:34.060
 So far.

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:34.540
 Right.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:38.700
 The only thing that I think would come close is the performance mixer from WMT,

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.420
 which is--

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.300
 But does that smell of rice?

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:40.780
 Huge.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:41.260
 Yeah.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:41.820
 Huge.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.100
 Also like a million channels.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.220
 Yeah.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.180
 Those are VCA's.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:45.740
 If you'd--

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.220
 Yeah.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:46.540
 Yeah.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.660
 It's still huge and pricey.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:54.140
 This costs 270 compared to like the 800 of the WMT performance.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.700
 Yeah.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.340
 That's awesome.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.100
 This also sounds like people that are like,

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.700
 this is what we want to use.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.820
 It doesn't exist.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.180
 We're making that thing we want to use.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.900
 That's sort of like noise engineering approach of like,

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.900
 we're making this thing that we want.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.900
 Oh, and by the way, we'll sell it to other people too.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.740
 That's kind of how I interpreted it too.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:13.020
 Like I was like, this is somebody's dream mixer that they came up with.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.460
 And I'm glad they did because it falls in line with my dream mixer.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.020
 I do this--

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:21.180
 I've been wanting a standalone of that for a decade now.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:21.660
 Mm.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.580
 Like I would love to have something like almost exactly what like what you've described.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:30.140
 Like that's the mixer I've wanted from playing live with all this other gear

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.980
 for a really long time now.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.860
 That sounds perfect.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.620
 Not to derail, but did you all see the 10-10 blue box mixer?

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.100
 I did.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:37.420
 Yeah.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.220
 Yeah, exactly.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:38.620
 I was like--

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.060
 It's not the thing.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:40.460
 Nah.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:44.940
 No control, but regardless, not to take away from the cosmetronic.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.260
 Yeah, it's pretty dope.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:54.380
 Like it's weird to get so excited about a mixer, but like I'm a huge fan of like

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.100
 fucking with weird mixers and finding overdrive.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.540
 I was gonna say it's not weird for you.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.020
 Right.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.620
 I've known it for a really long time now.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.020
 Like you've used mixers as an effect.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:03.500
 Exactly.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.100
 So this is not that surprising.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.620
 That's what blew me away about this.

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.180
 Like when I got this within minutes, I realized I was like,

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.380
 OK, this isn't just a mixer.

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.620
 This is a fucking instrument and I love it.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.180
 Like it's exactly what I was looking for.

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.540
 It feedbacks nice.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:18.700
 Yeah.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.180
 You know what I mean?

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.220
 Like feedback patching using it with the auxiliary send

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.900
 and all that jazz and the saturation.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.100
 It's a fucking dream.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.940
 Really happy with it.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.780
 And even buying two of them and having them in my rig now

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.660
 is still cheaper than like a WMD performance mixer.

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:34.220
 You know what I mean?

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.340
 You have two?

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:35.820
 Yeah.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.700
 I bought a second one like within days of getting the first one.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.100
 I was like, OK, I really like this.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:45.260
 So I bought a second one and then I sold my Erika drum mixer.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.060
 I sold my Erika stereo drum mixer.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.620
 I sold my IntelliJel mutamix.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.700
 Didn't need any of them anymore.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.220
 Like this does everything that I need.

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:58.620
 I have two of them being routed into the WMD

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:02.220
 cross-fader module that I forget the name of now.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.580
 Oh, the axis.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:04.140
 Axis.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:04.780
 That's it.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.500
 Thank you.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.220
 Yeah.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:10.060
 So I have like each mixer going into its own stereo.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.100
 So they're independent.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.660
 There's no sort of behind the scenes

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.100
 relationship between the two mix notes too.

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.140
 Not yet.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.140
 There is an expansion port on the back.

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.820
 OK.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.820
 And yeah, so I suspect in the near future there might be a way

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.020
 to daisy chain them or something which should save you on like,

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.860
 you know, some outputs there.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:29.180
 Right.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:30.460
 Which would be exciting.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.580
 I also recommended on the Muff thread

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.460
 that an expander with CV over the panning would be pretty nice.

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.260
 That would be amazing.

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:39.500
 Yeah.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.620
 And maybe even CV over the mute control.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.540
 Right now it's the flip switches.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:45.980
 And they are fun to perform with.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.700
 I've already tried it in a couple patches

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.100
 through one up on my Instagram the other day

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.060
 that I was having fun with.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:54.940
 And but you know, having CV control over that

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:56.460
 would just be that much nicer, you know.

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.140
 That's cool.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.860
 I mean, like I had not heard about it until you brought it up.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:03.740
 It was one of those happy discoveries, you know what I mean?

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.620
 I was like, cool.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.700
 I don't think many people know about this thing yet.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.660
 It hasn't even been out long yet, you know what I mean?

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.220
 I was like, I jived with it.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:15.420
 I just wanted to spread the word, I guess.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:16.380
 You have.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.820
 Also proves that the only real way to get down to finding the module you want

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.980
 is to go on module to grid,

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.940
 click other and unknown modules, set your type,

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.500
 and get to fucking scroll and there's no way around it.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:27.820
 Yeah.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.340
 I should mention I got the FX-Aid XL.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.540
 Oh.

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:34.220
 When did you get that?

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:38.860
 Oh, when we were talking about the Anwale Cave and got a few of them.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:39.340
 Mm-hmm.

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.380
 And it was like at 1.30 in the morning or something like that.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.260
 I was like, oh, they got them in.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.860
 I ordered mine then.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:48.220
 No, I guess I love having to love the XL.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.660
 Having the three CV inputs and not having to think about assigning it,

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.180
 that's like actually kind of gold.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.860
 High recommendation for that just on the CV inputs.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:00.300
 Yeah, I actually have them right next to each other right now.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:04.380
 So I can run one into the other if I want just like a delay reverb or something.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:07.420
 But I still have them on the stock firmware

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.860
 because you can take them both in the same firmware and just slightly alter them

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.220
 and then have two patches through them.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.940
 That's a lot of fun patching lies for sure.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.140
 Yeah.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.260
 Fucking the XL.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.780
 It's like, I don't know, happy nerding.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.380
 Like I have so much respect for them.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:24.140
 Just that module fucking is a game changer for me for sure.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.780
 I also still have the default.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.340
 And I keep seeing like, okay, there's new stuff.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.020
 There's stuff that like maybe I should get.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:33.340
 But I don't want to get rid of any of them.

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:38.220
 Like I have probably used all 32 of them at some point.

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:38.700
 Same.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.180
 Yeah.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:43.340
 Rarely do we say something has been nailed or they stuck the landing.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.460
 That is one.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.660
 It feels like it shouldn't exist.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.500
 It's like a fucking cheat code where it's like,

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.820
 why does this sound like, what the fuck did you do to make this sound like

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.740
 this shit that I've spent way more money on?

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:53.980
 Yeah.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:59.100
 I was feeling some real FOMO over the Hyperion synth tech for a minute too

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.860
 and not like jumping on one of those and the XL actually it was just like

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.380
 burst that fucking bubble for me.

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:08.220
 It's like the three CV controls over an effect that sounds this fucking good.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:09.820
 I don't even give a fuck about that.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:10.780
 Plus it doesn't have a screen.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.500
 And I kind of like, I don't necessarily like

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.620
 Hall's user experience for his screens on the stuff.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.060
 It works and it's fine, but it's not like I get it.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:23.100
 I'm sure Paul would love to explain why it's the best way to do it.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:28.380
 But it's not exciting for me to use the 352.

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:32.380
 Might only interested in that is having Paul come here and yell at us for an hour.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:32.700
 Yeah.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.540
 It's not the actual Hyperion itself.

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.660
 Always an open invitation.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:42.780
 And those were I think those were like 700 bucks and the XL was like 250 and the regular one's like 200 bucks.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:45.660
 He could charge twice that now.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.860
 It's still be like, okay, I'll do it.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:50.620
 I still don't have one.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:51.260
 I gotta get it.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.460
 Damn it.

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.420
 Honestly, and we've talked about it.

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.260
 The XL worth waiting for.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:01.100
 The non XL worth getting now.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:01.740
 Yeah.

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:04.300
 I know for that I won't the XL.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.340
 That's what I've been waiting for.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:09.820
 Like even though the non XL versions came back in stock, I was like real close pulling trigger.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.700
 And I was like, yeah, I know I'm going to want that CV control,

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.140
 even though it's a little bigger.

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.060
 So I'm just holding out.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:16.460
 Fair enough.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.060
 I'm just saying you are you would get a lot out of that.

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.340
 You would just right now.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.500
 Because remember you still have one CV.

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.660
 Three parameters.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.420
 It's easy to pick which one you get.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:32.300
 Get the non XL now and get a lot of use out of it.

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.140
 And then like I said, I'll buy it off you.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:36.860
 Right.

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.220
 I won't get rid of either.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:38.620
 Oh yeah.

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.300
 I mean, I don't think anyone is like, I've been keeping an eye on the use market too

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.740
 in hopes that one would pop up.

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.180
 I haven't seen any.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.140
 No, that's full on like even if someone got out of modular,

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:53.340
 it's worth getting like a small foreign mess like just for that.

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:53.900
 Okay.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.460
 That is like you are not going to get rid of that.

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:56.780
 Yeah.

00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:58.620
 I like the idea too.

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.300
 Like, okay, I have the bigger one.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.980
 If you like a theoretical hilarious future of live shows,

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:07.500
 it's like, oh, it's nice to be able to take the 4 HP one with the same shit,

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.220
 put it in a smaller case and then have that room.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.340
 But I'd still probably won't both of them in a live case anyway.

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:17.180
 Yeah, I like to run like two sounds out of my modular generator.

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:19.980
 Like maybe some drum, but like two big sounds.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:24.300
 And I've been used to send other than the modular in a minute now.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.300
 I think I've used this the DX 200, but that segues into.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.740
 Oh yeah.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.420
 So the only thing that I wanted to talk about.

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.860
 Please, please, I'm really curious about your opinion on this.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:35.180
 All right.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.260
 So this has an exposition.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.100
 This is a backstory.

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:39.580
 Nice.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:45.980
 This is like that one cut of Dune that has the 15 minutes explanation as to what's going on.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:47.260
 Have that on VHS tapes.

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:47.820
 I do too.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.980
 I mean, Harrison Ford to do a voiceover.

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:53.020
 A little narration introduction.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.980
 So I was talking about Blade Runner.

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.660
 Yeah, not Dune.

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.740
 I figured as much.

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:00.540
 Okay.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.540
 I don't know if you've ever seen Blade Runner, but-

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:03.100
 Oh my god.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.300
 I have it.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.500
 I see you just wanting to smack me.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.780
 Is that a rollerblading movie?

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:13.420
 Oh my god.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:13.580
 Yeah.

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:18.700
 Because there was that weird rollerblading skate rink up in the North Hills called Blade Runners.

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:18.860
 Yes.

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.780
 Are you kidding me?

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:20.940
 Yeah.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:25.820
 No, it was in like Wexford had like Blade Runners and it was just like some weird rollerblading plays.

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:26.700
 Oh, that should have been-

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:31.660
 I didn't mean to derail your exposition with Blade Runner talk.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:32.700
 That's why I wrote it down.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:33.020
 All right.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:34.460
 I can't fucking derail the strain.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.900
 It's written down.

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.540
 So yeah, like it was about a year ago.

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.980
 Roror 714, which is a Quailood reference.

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.220
 Whoa.

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.020
 We didn't know that.

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:48.780
 Yeah, that's what was printed or sort of stamped in the Quailoods.

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:52.780
 Also known as Ludes for you kids out there.

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:53.260
 Ludes.

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:53.660
 Kids.

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.180
 Definitely not for the kids.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.700
 For you.

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.420
 Grandparents.

00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.020
 Kids, go out there and get some Ludes.

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.740
 Do you think they stopped making it in the eight seventies?

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:05.340
 If you can find some Ludes, please send them to us because

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.060
 they're really hard to come by now.

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:08.700
 We'll take them.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.820
 So, but it's a local label.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:16.460
 They do like, put on like noise, industrial ambient stuff.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.740
 And the dude runs it.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.500
 Super nice guy, Greg.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.900
 Goes by Easy Bake Oven.

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.300
 Does really good stuff like in his own right.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.860
 And then he puts out stuff and he asked me to make a record.

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:32.540
 So I did over the last year and I mean nine tracks originally.

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:36.140
 And then I'd send it to you two and the ninth track,

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:39.020
 both of you were like, oh, this seems really out of place.

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.660
 And you both had the same opinion of it.

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.820
 And what it was, that was something I made almost entirely with a DX 200.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:46.300
 Okay.

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:50.780
 So it was just like super FM heavy with some like weird IDM beats.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.700
 So you know what you're right.

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.700
 This doesn't belong in that release.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.780
 And the releases come out if we're doing plugs.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.820
 Yeah.

00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:58.140
 Yeah.

00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:58.860
 Plug it up.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.500
 Go into the Rover 717 bandcamp.

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.980
 I think it's still the latest release up there.

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.220
 Eight cylinder.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:08.460
 Proceeding through weightless wreckage.

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.740
 Oh, this is a big one.

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:09.980
 Yes.

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:17.340
 I've really been into like the really like wordy, super pretentious titles.

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:18.380
 I've been doing that for a while now.

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:18.700
 Yeah.

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.380
 I don't know.

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:22.300
 I don't find it to be pretentious, but I know you.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.260
 I think it's better than the opposite side of the spectrum,

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:28.380
 which is a bunch of random characters or like,

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.420
 "Weathered Stone."

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:30.300
 Yeah.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.740
 That's so yeah.

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.940
 But in any case, that is now out.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.620
 Available on digital NCD.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.020
 That stands for compact disc out there, kiddies.

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:44.540
 But I was really happy with the results of the other eight.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.740
 And I'm glad they're out there.

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.940
 But that ninth track just like stuck in my crawl.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.140
 I'm like, "Oh, that didn't fit."

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:51.820
 Oh, but I really liked it.

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.420
 I like making it.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:57.500
 And so I started thinking about like just FM and getting back into that.

00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:02.620
 So then I was like, "Well, what FM options are there in modular?"

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:07.020
 So obviously, the first big one was a chemis castle.

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:11.260
 And I have a couple of other modules that have like FM as an input.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:16.780
 Basically it just operates as like a single operator or single carrier, single modulator.

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:20.700
 Those are great, but that's not really what I'm looking for.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:25.420
 So I was looking into a chemis and it has the fixed algorithms.

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:30.940
 And it actually uses like sort of like new old stock Yamaha ICs.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:31.580
 Oh, no shit.

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:31.980
 Yeah.

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:32.940
 I didn't know that.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.740
 So while initially like was like, "This is perfect."

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.180
 There was a part of me in the back of my head.

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.580
 It was like, "You kind of already have that.

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:41.020
 You have a DX200."

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:44.940
 This is more or less the same with like some CV inputs.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.580
 Let me just take a look around and see what else is out there.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:54.540
 So I started looking around and came across the humble quad operator.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:59.980
 And I saw it and I was like, "Whoa, that is a lot of shit surfaced."

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:03.980
 And then I saw a video of the guy who designed it talking about, he was like,

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:10.060
 "We have this idea of FM that is algorithm based."

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.660
 And you have this idea of like, you've got these fixed algorithms where these operators have

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:17.180
 these set sort of relationships that define the sound.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:18.700
 And that comes from Yamaha.

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:19.100
 Yeah.

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:22.060
 He's like, "There's no reason that has to be the case."

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:23.660
 He's like, "You could..."

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:28.780
 And his like one of his plans was to come up with a way to set up a sort of

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:35.100
 mod matrix of operators where you define what those relationships between the operators are

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:36.140
 and surface all of that.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:40.380
 My interest was immediately peaked.

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:45.420
 So I started looking into it and it's a four operator.

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:51.980
 Each of the operators are variable wavelength, going through the sort of standard wave shapes.

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:58.540
 So basically from there, that's where things start to get off the rails.

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:03.580
 There's an individual output per operator, which ends up being a really interesting addition.

00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:05.500
 Yeah.

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:08.780
 There's also a fifth operator, which is just an input.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:13.980
 And so you think about it like combining the fact that the other four have outs,

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.620
 process them and feed one of them back in.

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.700
 Yes.

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:24.460
 All of the operators have their own VCA associated with them.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:31.820
 Then there's on top of that, they're either locked to, there's like a little toggle for each of them.

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:35.420
 They're either locked to this main tuning.

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:37.020
 Oh, that's sick.

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:37.340
 Yeah.

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:37.820
 I know that.

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:42.620
 Or you can unlock them, in which case the ratio then becomes just a free floating

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:46.700
 like course tuning.

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.420
 All of that is C-viable.

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:53.580
 The gain for each of them, all the VCA's are C-viable.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.980
 The shape of them are all C-viable.

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:56.940
 Yeah.

00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:04.620
 Then on top of that, you have the four outputs of them, there's the mod matrix.

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:07.580
 So it's a matrix of four by five.

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:14.300
 So for each of the operators, there's then a column that set, you then set how much,

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:20.060
 in each row sort of corresponds to the operator, you set how much that other operator is going to

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:23.580
 affect the one that you are operating in that column.

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:24.140
 Okay.

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:25.180
 Including itself.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:30.940
 So for the first operator, you could then have it feeding back itself by just

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:39.260
 turning up the gain on that mod matrix for that one one or two, two, three, three, four, four.

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:40.300
 Nice.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.660
 Like I actually have the note, say this just because it's important.

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:51.020
 There's an LFO mode and you can reset the input based on a gate to reset the LFO mode.

00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:52.220
 That is not exciting.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:52.380
 Right.

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.900
 Like it's cool.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.020
 Maybe someday I'll use it.

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.100
 Seems superfluous for what it's supposed to do.

00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:01.900
 A little bit like, like if I'm using this for that, things have gotten weird.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.220
 Right.

00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.580
 I'm bored.

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:04.380
 Yeah.

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:09.260
 There's also what an expander for, the algo expander.

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:13.020
 It has three persisted settings and settings.

00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:17.980
 Basically you hold it in and it will set, it captures the state of the mod matrix.

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:18.540
 Okay.

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.500
 And stores it.

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.780
 And then there's a crossfader and you basically select which two you want running.

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:28.060
 The fourth one on the algo, this algo expander is just the current state.

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:35.340
 So you can have a preset or two presets and mix between them or preset and what's going on live

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.380
 and mix between them.

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:42.940
 So this is also really reminiscent to me of the DX 200 morphing between these different

00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:48.860
 FM settings or they called them on the DX 200 scenes, but basically you create these scenes.

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:55.020
 So you can come up with this like super crazy noisy configuration, store it in one,

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.220
 then do something live that's a little more subtle or maybe a little more musical, a little

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.020
 more harmonic and then slowly mix between them.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:04.700
 That also can be C Veed, just the crossfader.

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:08.540
 I got this over the course of the next week.

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.540
 I basically change and rearrange everything.

00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:13.740
 This is now the centerpiece of everything I'm doing.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.460
 Oh shit.

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:15.100
 Yeah.

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.020
 This is flip my script.

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:22.540
 Like the next thing that I make is entirely focused on just using this.

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:27.980
 It is it's opened up FM in a way that no other sort of FM thing that I've worked with does.

00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:31.340
 It opened it changes the way that I'm thinking about it.

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:39.100
 Even just being able to take different sequences and run them into the ratios for either the locked

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:44.220
 or the free floating operators gives me these different patterns that are moving in and out.

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:50.380
 So you almost have this like a four piece and it's not just sort of I'm playing a note.

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:55.260
 I'm bringing this in and it then morphs these other things and you can have

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:59.340
 this morphing this and this morphs that and this affects this.

00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:06.300
 And while that's happening, you now have an LFO just very slowly switching between the waveforms.

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:11.100
 Then on top of that, you can have a sequence of VCA's where things just disappear for a while

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:12.700
 and then slowly come back in.

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.780
 I fucking love this module.

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:18.540
 I completely blown away by it.

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:22.060
 Seemed like the quintessential Dave module when I was looking into it.

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:29.420
 I remember using the prototype of it like two years ago at knob con and was immediately like

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:30.220
 wildly into it.

00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.460
 So I was super curious to see what you would get.

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:35.900
 And I've only had it for a little bit a little bit of time now and I've done a bunch of

00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:40.220
 experimenting and at this point I'm still, I'm not making anything with it.

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:43.100
 This is me just still figuring things out.

00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:48.220
 And really that fifth operator taking an operator that is being modulated internally

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.980
 by this mod matrix, processing it just slightly because it's FM.

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:52.700
 So it's touchy.

00:59:52.700 --> 01:00:00.860
 If I fuck it up too much and it comes back in, now I'm into noise, which is cool.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.060
 I like that.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:06.380
 But if I just take it out, just do a little bit with it, just a slight mod,

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:12.460
 bring that back in and then incorporate that into this just network of things that are

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.900
 operating off of each other, the results have been astounding.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:19.180
 I'm absolutely blown away by it.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:22.220
 And this is normally the part where I would go, here's my complaints.

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:22.620
 I don't.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.580
 I don't have anything.

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:29.260
 So what's the people bitch about a VCA bleed thing or something like that or is that?

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:33.660
 So I got the latest firmware in which he said he corrected it to a high degree.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.660
 I don't hear it.

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:39.500
 Apparently there is a VCA bleed where it doesn't.

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.340
 Nothing goes all the way down to zero.

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.220
 I'm not picking that up though.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:48.380
 I'm getting the clean, I'm getting clean signals from all of them.

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.900
 I'm able to turn them all the way off in the mod matrix.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:57.660
 And if I send CV to it, I'm getting these clean signs that are not being affected by it.

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.580
 So you've individual operator outputs, right?

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:06.540
 Is there also like a summed output or are you mixing these things like separately from it?

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:07.340
 How does that work?

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.060
 That's a good question.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:12.540
 So you basically can decide which operator you want to be the main operator.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.300
 Okay.

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:19.500
 Or what I've been doing is I've been sending all of those to the four inputs of planar

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.140
 and mixing them via vector mixing.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:22.780
 Oh shit.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:23.260
 Okay.

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.220
 That's fucking hard.

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:27.100
 There is no main output though to answer like that.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.020
 Like you might expect out of like another like sort of fix packs like DX.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.300
 Yeah, like a DX7 is right.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.340
 Stereo output or whatever.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:33.580
 Yeah.

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:34.700
 No, there isn't.

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.780
 So you know, you can say like, okay, operator one, you're going to be the main one.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:44.060
 And then you just sort of design everything in your mod matrix towards that being your main output.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:48.300
 But you could easily just choose a different one.

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.660
 Can you have two main oscillators?

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:54.540
 Like can do, oh like two and two pairs or something like that.

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:55.980
 Well, you can just do however you want.

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.060
 And you would define that by the matrix.

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:00.460
 You would then say, okay, I want these two to be the main outs.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:00.860
 Oh right.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.060
 Just route it to that.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:02.380
 Exactly.

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.820
 And there is your mix.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.980
 You could then set them in your matrix.

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:13.500
 However you want, you can even have them slightly off from one another and send CV to the gain or the

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.260
 the waveform.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:21.340
 Then you get that slow sort of weird stereo offset as they're sort of shifting in and out.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:25.980
 It's more like an FM canvas than an FM pipeline.

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.100
 Oh yeah.

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:27.500
 That makes sense.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.700
 Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:28.780
 Yeah.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.340
 Yeah.

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:29.900
 That's awesome.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:34.220
 That sounds very modular, very up your alley in that regard.

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:38.540
 Because you get all the freedom to make all the mistakes and choices that you want.

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:39.180
 Yeah.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.820
 And the mistakes are there plenty.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.540
 Oh yeah.

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.940
 You can definitely go the fuck off the rails on this.

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.180
 Like there's a little bit of patience.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:51.580
 And I think maybe that's one thing that the DX design is like,

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:54.300
 they're not going to let you go too far off the trail.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.500
 However many algorithms.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.140
 Exactly.

01:02:56.140 --> 01:03:00.940
 And those algorithms are catered towards good sounds or this is going to make a lot of sense.

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.820
 Oh, Bo.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:02.140
 Yeah.

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:02.460
 Yeah.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:07.260
 It's going to keep you sort of confined to that where this is like, you're not confined.

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.900
 This is not something I hear that got out of my DX 200.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.140
 Right.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:10.700
 Right.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:13.260
 How do you feel what the mini pots is annoying?

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.940
 Is it just not a big deal?

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:18.780
 It is a little, not annoying isn't the right word.

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:22.220
 It is sometimes a little hard to dial in exactly right.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:27.740
 It's not just not a big problem for the ratio when you're locked because it's 11th.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.340
 So you're just kind of like.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.460
 Oh, you're monetized a little.

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:31.180
 Yeah, exactly.

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.300
 That one's not too bad.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:37.420
 But like if you go into free form mode, that is a pretty wide range of octaves.

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.660
 That's that ends up being a little tough to dial in.

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:42.700
 I guess maybe I said I wasn't going to have a complaint.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:47.660
 But one of the complaints maybe is I don't see myself using this live because of that.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:48.060
 Okay.

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:51.900
 The only reason I could ever see myself using this live is if I was like, okay, I have three

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:56.300
 saved presets and then was mixing between those.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:56.940
 That would work.

01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:01.340
 But I cannot, I can never see myself jamming on those tiny pots.

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:01.660
 Yeah.

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:07.180
 It wouldn't like I got the compromise because if you would make it like normal pots,

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.700
 it would be fucking huge.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.140
 It's already a pretty big module.

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:10.700
 Yeah.

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.740
 And I'd like that he decided to surface all of this.

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.220
 That's the thing that makes it so appealing.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:20.060
 It's a lot of stuff surfaced and a lot of everything that you want to be CVable is

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.980
 has CV for it.

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:27.580
 If they were big size pots, though, yeah, it would be it would be a pretty big module.

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:31.660
 Is this the final nail and the DX 200s coffin then?

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.580
 I think they're actually slightly different.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:39.820
 Just because there's still a little bit of character to those old Yamaha chips,

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.980
 there's a part of me that's like, I'm just so used to it.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:45.420
 I've been using it for so long that like, I don't want to I don't want to get rid of

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.700
 something that I know really well.

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.700
 If that makes sense, sure.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:51.100
 I just I think they're kind of different at this point.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.500
 I would probably come up with different uses for them.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.860
 Would you buy another DX 200 if it died?

01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.060
 That's a really good question.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:58.860
 Probably not now.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.540
 I think if before this, I would have said yes and a heartbeat.

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.460
 And now I'm like, I could probably live without it.

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.780
 This would probably be enough for me.

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:14.460
 If what I just described you sounds like your cup of tea, I would suggest going for it.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:22.700
 If that sounded like tedious, hell or too much math or too much possibility for failure.

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.740
 Yeah, no, don't get it then.

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:26.780
 Yeah, get the fuck out of here.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:30.700
 I love FM, but I love FM for idiots.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.740
 Yeah, it's always been my take on it.

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:39.100
 Like the most experimental I've got with FM was the Hertz Donut on occasion,

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:44.140
 which was a little freestyle, but not nearly as complicated as that.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:48.060
 Like when I looked at the quad operator, I was like,

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:53.900
 I probably wouldn't make anything worth a damn on that for hours and hours.

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:59.340
 But I was like, I can definitely see Dave mastering that thing and shit like that.

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:03.980
 You get a lot out of cycles though or model cycles.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:07.100
 I do because that's for idiots.

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.820
 That's why I still have it.

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.860
 Sounds good.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:13.740
 Actually, I've had a lot of people message me about that, I guess,

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:17.100
 because I posted a couple demos on Instagram and I had a few people reach out to me

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:26.460
 and inquire my take on it on Muff's and Instagram, which is weird because I didn't say much about

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:32.220
 it and by no means am I into electron over all these days.

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:38.380
 So I was kind of confused as to why so many people wanted to know more about that over a lot

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:43.660
 of the other things that I've posted. But no, I still like it. I still have it.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:50.140
 It's still a very simple to use down to earth FM drum machine.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.180
 You know what I mean?

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:55.340
 I can't do any of the things you just described with a lot of operator.

01:06:55.340 --> 01:07:01.020
 But I can get some decent FM results nonetheless out of it.

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:01.980
 It works for me.

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:06.140
 But again, it's FM light.

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.900
 What have you been principally using it for?

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:10.460
 Just drums.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.660
 Yeah.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.460
 Nice.

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:15.100
 I mean, it's kind of what it's designed for.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:15.260
 Right.

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:18.860
 You know, it's got the cord and the tone machines in there, which I like,

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:22.700
 but I can do that in modular, of course, you know, wherever.

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:29.100
 But if I want to have like eight, you know, FM drum just going on at once,

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:34.700
 I can bang that out on, you know, the electron cycles within seconds.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.780
 I haven't really been recording much with it. It's more like a fun fuck around

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:42.620
 box for me when I just want to jam out, you know what I mean?

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.940
 Without putting too much thought into it.

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:48.780
 Are you pross- are you running it into the modular and processing in a lot?

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:49.340
 I was, yeah.

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:49.660
 Okay.

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:53.260
 Still shame they didn't do the separate outs.

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.260
 Yep.

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.300
 Have one in that case.

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.780
 Yeah.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.540
 But um,

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:05.100
 I did get a new voice lately though.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:05.740
 Oh, what's that?

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.340
 Some FM shit in it.

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.140
 The uh, I'll wait for this plane to go away.

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:15.580
 Got the qubit surface.

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:17.180
 Huh, okay.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:20.620
 I took another gamble on a qubit module.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.700
 What had enticed you about it?

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.980
 Uh, curiosity.

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:24.860
 Okay, to be honest.

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.180
 Um,

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:31.340
 because I've been really enjoying rings and this is qubit's version of rings.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:32.940
 Yeah, that's what it kind of seemed like.

01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:36.700
 Yeah, it's described as a multi-timber physical modeling voice.

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:42.780
 However, they kind of focused directly on like what rings it does.

01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:46.300
 Like physical modeling can go in a lot of ways.

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.020
 Oh, saxophone.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:47.340
 Yeah.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.660
 I mean, or percussion.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.060
 You know what I mean?

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:50.540
 Yeah.

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:56.140
 This is definitely more rings than say like IntelliJel Plonk or something like that.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:56.540
 Gotcha.

01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:02.380
 Um, but there is some similarities, some similarities between both uh, rings and plonk with

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:04.700
 in surfaces, uh, feature set.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:05.580
 Um,

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:12.620
 I think they did a good job though of making it feel unique and not just a complete

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.420
 rings rip off.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:13.980
 Mm-hmm.

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:17.100
 Um, they like tried to push things a little further.

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:22.780
 Um, the voices, for example, the multi-timberal aspect.

01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:26.140
 It can go up to eight voices whereas rings caps out at four.

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:26.460
 Okay.

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:30.540
 Um, so that's, you know, essentially double.

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:32.220
 Um,

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:38.460
 both rings and surface can do like your pluck strings, your bells, your FM plonks,

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:41.820
 and can get like percussive.

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:46.300
 They did add a few models in there that are straight percussive and percussion though.

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.220
 I don't know why I'm having trouble saying words.

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:55.420
 Um, like they have a model in there that's kick and snare, um, which is, it's nice.

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:59.820
 Um, are they natural or are they emulating like 808 and 909?

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.060
 No, it's, it's, it doesn't sound like

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.300
 and, you know, like a machine to me.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.820
 It sounds a little more natural.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:10.700
 It doesn't sound like, um, anything specific.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.740
 You know what I mean?

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:17.020
 It like, and it all depends on how you adjust the, uh, the other parameters,

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:19.340
 the tone knob and the strike knob.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.020
 I was gonna ask, what are those parameters?

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:23.020
 What are the dimensions you have control over?

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:29.340
 You have control over choke, which is also a new unique feature that isn't on rings.

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:30.540
 It is on plonk.

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:35.340
 Um, so you have choke, you have strike and you have tone.

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:39.260
 Both of those do different things depending on the model.

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:43.020
 Um, and then you have decay and model.

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:45.900
 So you can CV all of those.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:46.540
 Even model?

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:47.180
 Even model.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.180
 Um, oh, that's weird.

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:55.820
 That's, that's, now what is the effect of setting like a pretty high, high frequency LFO

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.020
 into model?

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.980
 Would it like, I haven't tried anything like audio rate or anything like that,

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:04.940
 but I have tried just like, you know, typical like envelopes and LFOs and things like that.

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.820
 It was like, yeah, switching types kind of like, you know,

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:12.300
 switching modes and not smoothly sweeping through those models.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:17.100
 It's, in my opinion, it doesn't work.

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.860
 You know what I mean?

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:19.500
 Yeah.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.780
 Like, that was a problem with braids originally too,

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:25.980
 is that you could adjust the different macros via CV,

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:29.660
 but a lot of them didn't go nicely into each other.

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:31.740
 Um, it's kind of the same deal here.

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:35.820
 And the positioning of some of the models, I think is weird.

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:40.700
 Like, like over halfway through, you hit like the kick in the snare.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:46.780
 And then after that, there's prepared keys, I believe it is, or a weird, yeah, whatever.

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:51.660
 It's like got some things going on that shouldn't be at the end.

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:54.860
 I feel like the kick in the snare should probably be at the end of the chain there.

01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:55.660
 Things like that.

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:58.700
 Um, it's a neat feature.

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:03.420
 I don't see myself utilizing it too, too much, um, especially because like,

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:08.140
 the other parameters vary between the models.

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:11.500
 So like, just because you have something dialed in nicely on one model,

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:15.180
 it can sound like not nice by the time you go into the next model.

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.660
 So if you've got modulation on all of the parameters,

01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:19.740
 right, it's going to potentially be a mess.

01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:20.140
 Yes.

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.020
 Oh, wow.

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:21.260
 Okay.

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:26.060
 So yeah, I haven't been getting too much use out of the model modulation.

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:28.780
 Um, it's also similar to rings, though.

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:31.340
 This does have some hidden modes.

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:38.540
 They have a mode that's called dark mode that you can get into.

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:42.220
 The manual doesn't describe what the hell this is.

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:43.340
 [laughter]

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:45.100
 Um, it's too dark to print.

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:45.260
 Yeah.

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.300
 It's just a panel color.

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:51.900
 All it says is that it unlocks extreme settings that are unique to each of the different models.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.020
 Oh, it's a loudness button.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.620
 On a boom box.

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:55.100
 Loudness.

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:55.740
 It sounds louder.

01:12:55.740 --> 01:13:00.860
 It just seems to change some of the models and how they react to strike end tone.

01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:05.260
 That's a little unnerving that they can't describe to you in any sort of like,

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.580
 scientific or plain terms.

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:08.060
 Yeah.

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:09.580
 It's extreme.

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.820
 It's extreme with an X.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.540
 So I have no idea what it is doing.

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:20.940
 They only say that it won't sound as good when you're mixing between the models.

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:24.860
 But in my opinion, I kind of like it or I like it more.

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:25.660
 Which is great.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:30.940
 I've been using it more than the default mode and I kind of like it when I'm switching through

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:31.980
 the models a little more.

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:34.940
 So I don't know what it's doing, but it's neat that it's there.

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:40.620
 There is no onboard secret reverb modes like ring has.

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.100
 Mm-hmm.

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:42.460
 So that's a bit disappointing.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:49.020
 Because I feel like it just begs to be heavily processed, especially by reverb.

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:49.500
 Mm-hmm.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.860
 You know, I mean same with rings.

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.580
 Like rings has an onboard reverb.

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:54.060
 You can...

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:54.940
 I didn't know that.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:56.060
 Yeah, it's secret mode.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:56.380
 Yeah.

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.300
 And it's decent.

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:03.180
 But I usually opt for a different, you know, reverb module anyways.

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.180
 But sometimes like it's nice to have both.

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:06.700
 Is it like the clouds verb kind of?

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:07.260
 Kind of, yeah.

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:13.980
 And it does have secret modes similar to rings that will adjust the panning of the output.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:14.780
 Like...

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:16.860
 Gotcha.

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:22.140
 For example, you'd have like different hits going at random coming out of left

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:26.220
 right, things like that instead of just like a straight hard pan and things like that.

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.540
 Rings has some secret modes like that also.

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:35.020
 But yeah, definitely a lot of similarities there.

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:35.660
 But...

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:38.220
 So how have you been using this so far?

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.380
 It's...

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:43.740
 I've only gotten like into it for the last couple nights.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:46.620
 So far I've just been using it as like a...

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:51.340
 I guess you could say a texture or pad voice.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.500
 Which is often how I use rings too.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:59.740
 It lacks the input that rings has, you know, the route,

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:03.020
 you know, external sounds through the resonator to, you know,

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:06.300
 do any type of processing.

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:10.300
 So it's kind of like just is what you get, you know what I mean?

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:11.180
 There's no real...

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:17.660
 You can't use it as a processor, which I like to use rings for a lot.

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:20.060
 Do you still have a rings?

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:23.100
 I do. I got rid of one to make room for surface.

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.300
 Like I was having trouble choosing kind of like both of them.

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:28.940
 So I just decided to keep both surfaces.

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:30.860
 Have you been running surface through rings?

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.220
 I have not done that.

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:35.820
 I don't... didn't really feel necessary.

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:36.540
 You know what I mean?

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:41.420
 It seemed a little redundant, but I have been running it through clouds, go figure.

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.780
 Right.

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:43.660
 You know, of course.

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:45.820
 So I need the cactus.

01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:47.020
 That's right.

01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:49.900
 I need some more succulents, cactuses.

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:53.500
 Yeah.

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:58.060
 It doesn't sound as good to me as rings in some ways.

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.660
 Like rings kind of feels like you can go off the rails with it

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:05.020
 and get some dissonant results that might not be intended.

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:05.580
 You know what I mean?

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:09.660
 It feels like you're doing physical modeling with rings.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.740
 Like it feels like you're getting your hands dirty

01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:15.740
 with that type of synthesis.

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:24.140
 Whereas surface to me kind of feels at times like they've made super limited ranges

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.900
 of the sounds you're getting out of it.

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:30.460
 Like it almost feels like you're manipulating like a sample engine at times.

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:31.340
 Like you know what I mean?

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:36.620
 Yeah, you're heavily bounded into these sort of like good sounds or like prescribed sounds.

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.100
 Exactly.

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:37.420
 Yeah.

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:39.660
 And it does sound good though.

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:41.420
 It's just definitely more limited.

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:44.860
 Like you're not going to cover as much sonic territory as you can with a rings.

01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:47.740
 In some ways that's a good thing though.

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:51.100
 Like I've been using it when I would just want to dial in something quickly.

01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:54.460
 Like an FM drone or strings.

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.020
 You know what I mean?

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:55.900
 Things like that.

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:59.020
 I haven't really been using it too much for percussive elements,

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.900
 which I do more with rings.

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:05.340
 So I feel like it's a nice counterbalance to rings.

01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:10.860
 It's probably the first qubit module that I've purchased

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:14.460
 that I didn't immediately have like buyers remorse or regret over.

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:16.140
 You know what I mean?

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:19.260
 Like usually there's stuff seems good in concept to me,

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:22.540
 but the end result usually leaves me a bit disappointed.

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:23.980
 So far I'm digging this.

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:27.180
 I don't see me like getting rid of it in the near future.

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.580
 I feel like it definitely has a place in my current setup.

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:35.740
 Another nice feature is that it actually remembers the extra modes

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:37.820
 when you enable them at power on and off.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:38.700
 So you don't...

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:42.140
 Yeah, like so once you get it in a configuration that you're happy with,

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:44.860
 you don't have to dial that back in every time.

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:48.700
 Is there a way to save presets or any sort of...

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:49.980
 No, okay.

01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.500
 No presets or anything like that.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:55.900
 But yeah, like I made a generative patch with it the other night,

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:59.580
 with it as like the sole voice and you know,

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:04.620
 it was going through I think the Joe filter and clouds and things like that.

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:08.460
 And it just made like some hypnotic atmospheres that I got

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.780
 lost in for like a couple hours.

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:13.340
 So it's interesting.

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:14.460
 I'll give it a thumbs up.

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:18.060
 Your voice though is the training.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.060
 Yeah, it's like this.

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.420
 It's a thumbs up.

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.420
 It's not a vertical thumbs up.

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:27.900
 I hope that they kind of push it a bit further.

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:30.940
 Like I hope that this isn't the final firmware.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:33.580
 God, it seems like there's a lot of room for growth there.

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:37.020
 Are there pins on the back for maybe an expander?

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:37.900
 I actually didn't check.

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.380
 That's a good question.

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:43.180
 I don't know of any expanders for qubit stuff though.

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.020
 I don't think that's something they typically do.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:49.340
 But they expanded it.

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:50.060
 They should.

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:50.860
 They should.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:51.260
 They should.

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:52.220
 So if they expanded it,

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:53.660
 you think it's going to be in firmware.

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:54.700
 It's gonna be in software.

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:56.700
 Yeah, I would like to see more models.

01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:59.660
 Do you have recommendations?

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.020
 Here's your platform.

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:02.540
 You're on a pedestal.

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:03.740
 I don't.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:08.540
 But I feel like if they're already going to borrow that much from rings

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:11.740
 and plonk, I feel like they should go all in.

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:12.380
 A little bit.

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.380
 Yeah, and just take it to the next level.

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:17.900
 I feel like if you're going to bother to put in a kick drum,

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:20.300
 put in 12 of them.

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:20.780
 You know what I mean?

01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:24.540
 Because you really can't get that much out of the model that's in there currently.

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:26.460
 And it's like, okay, that's a start.

01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.940
 Keep going the next route.

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:31.180
 Or maybe even like.

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.540
 Instead of having everything all in.

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:38.700
 Linear fashion through the through the modeling.

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:41.900
 Use your hidden mode capabilities to like.

01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.500
 Bring in like.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:43.820
 Yeah.

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:48.220
 So you're in kick drum mode and the model will go through 12 different versions

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:50.300
 of physical modeling drum sound.

01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:50.860
 You know what I mean?

01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:51.980
 Things that would be cool.

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:52.300
 Yeah.

01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:56.300
 You could do the same with the keys and the FM and the bell.

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:56.860
 You know what I mean?

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:58.460
 Like really blow it out.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.900
 Almost like categorized them.

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:00.460
 Exactly.

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.300
 Yeah, that would be amazing.

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:08.300
 And that would make the model selection capabilities like way more usable.

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:08.620
 Yeah.

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:09.260
 You know what I mean?

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:11.420
 Like right now it's just kind of like a novelty.

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:14.620
 Like I don't see anyone getting a whole lot of use out of that.

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:17.180
 They could do a lot more with it.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:17.660
 Right.

01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:22.780
 And that's always my complaint with Cubit is that their stuff always seems a little self limited.

01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:23.100
 Yeah.

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:28.060
 And it always seems not half baked, but like just not quite there.

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:28.860
 It's not bold.

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:29.340
 Yeah.

01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.860
 It was like so visually simple to I remember like the word module.

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:36.940
 I was like, oh, that's that's a really simple version of that idea.

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:37.180
 Right.

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:38.220
 I don't know what you know.

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:38.700
 I don't know.

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.300
 So Greg.

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:43.420
 There was something you wanted to talk about.

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.660
 The flux.

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.780
 Now, which flux are you talking about?

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:49.020
 You're not talking about the the flux.

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:50.540
 Flux one.

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.340
 No, sir.

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:56.460
 This is the I/O Labs flux temporal modulation rhythm sequencer.

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:00.540
 I would ask you what that means, but nobody knows.

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:08.060
 In fact, judging by the current state of the Muffwiggler's thread for this device,

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:11.980
 no one knows what the hell they're doing with it even after owning it.

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:13.180
 Have you read that?

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:14.300
 I just saw that today.

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:14.940
 Oh my god.

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.140
 People confused.

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:20.780
 One person today asked so, hey, everyone does had this for a couple of weeks now.

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:21.820
 How are you driving with it?

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:26.380
 And like the thread just blew of like everyone being like,

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.900
 I have no fucking clue what I'm doing.

01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:31.420
 I think one person was like, oh, I'm getting on with it.

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:32.780
 Yeah.

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:33.660
 You think they were lying?

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.940
 Maybe.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:35.420
 I don't know.

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:38.860
 They posted a couple of videos to demonstrate that they're having fun with it.

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:41.340
 I'm somewhere in between.

01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:46.300
 I don't feel completely dumbfounded by this thing.

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:54.140
 And at the same time, I don't feel like I'm fully assimilated into the flux fold just yet.

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:59.820
 I've managed to make some fun, interesting sequences with it.

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:05.980
 But there's a lot of things that I don't have a fucking clue what they do.

01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:07.580
 You know what I mean?

01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:11.420
 What are the things that you're not necessarily groking with?

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:13.580
 What are the things that are causing you consternation?

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:17.660
 There's nothing that's really frustrating me or causing me like

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:19.740
 setbacks.

01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:22.620
 There's just things that I'm tweaking and I'm getting results.

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:27.740
 And either I like them or I don't, but I don't necessarily understand exactly

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:31.340
 what some of them are doing.

01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:34.060
 If I'm doing it correctly, you know what I mean?

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:37.020
 Like, just kind of like fumbling in the dark.

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:40.860
 But it's a fun experiment for me at least.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.820
 Well, like, what would be an example of like, is it a modulation?

01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:44.860
 Is it a step?

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.620
 It's hard to even put into words.

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:50.700
 Like, this module is unlike anything I've ever messed with before.

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:51.500
 It's a weirdo.

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:52.540
 It's strange.

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:57.260
 Like messing with the curves and then messing with like the

01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:01.340
 var parameter of them and things like that.

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:06.300
 Haven't really dove into the modulation matrix at all.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.140
 I did not want to open up that can of worms.

01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.460
 And honestly, I haven't really needed to yet.

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.460
 I've been coming up with interesting results

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:15.820
 without diving into that.

01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:17.660
 Like, that was one thing that really appealed to me.

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:20.060
 It was like the fact that you could have things,

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:23.100
 you know, being modulated on your rhythm and things like that.

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.300
 But like, you can get enough variance out of your sequence

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:29.500
 that it doesn't feel repetitive without even modulating anything.

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:29.740
 Right.

01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:30.220
 So far.

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:30.860
 I could see that.

01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:38.060
 But like, it's just, it can get so meta with itself.

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.180
 Like, it really can.

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:43.500
 Like, you can have an infinite like sequence going on

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:47.580
 on a single step in your sequence pattern.

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:50.460
 You know, so like, no, I don't know.

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:51.820
 It's weird, man.

01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:53.420
 Like, yeah, it's super weird.

01:23:53.420 --> 01:24:00.860
 Like, yeah, like 64 steps that are actually denser than 64 steps

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:02.780
 because you can condense these things.

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:07.340
 And it's like 64 steps, but it's on one step.

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:08.780
 So it's like not steps.

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:13.580
 It's like points within your curve that are generating like each step.

01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:16.700
 I mean, I'm way more confused than when you started.

01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:20.380
 It's like in the duration of a drum hit, there's 64 hits

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.740
 that'll occur within that.

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:24.780
 We're talking micro steps within micro steps here

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:29.100
 that don't even need to follow any type of quantization rules,

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.420
 which is the cool thing about it.

01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.220
 No way.

01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:33.740
 And you can have interesting part.

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:34.460
 Yeah.

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:37.180
 And you can have humanization on top of that

01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:40.060
 and multiple steps and modulation.

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:41.900
 And this is all one channel, one step.

01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:44.220
 And then you have your auxiliary outs

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:49.260
 that are all ping ponging off of your main channel out.

01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:49.660
 You know?

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:50.780
 I didn't know that.

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:51.420
 I knew that.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:51.900
 I didn't know that.

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:54.220
 Yeah, you can have different delays,

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.780
 trigger delays, I should say,

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.460
 different patterns of trigger delays

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:04.780
 that are going off of your main output or temporal sequences

01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:06.460
 that are based off of your main output.

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:09.260
 So it's deep.

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:13.100
 Like, is it just fiddly, free jazz, weirdo?

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:14.540
 If you want, if you want.

01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:14.860
 Okay.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.180
 But like, or do you feel like you still have control over everything?

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.460
 Or is it just kind of like,

01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:23.420
 I'm letting this weird thing go on its own?

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:28.940
 I feel like I'm playing with the product of someone way smarter than me.

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.060
 I see, I see.

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:33.820
 Like, I thought I understood Rhythmic's well.

01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:36.860
 This module has proven to me otherwise.

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.580
 But it's exciting to play with.

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.500
 It's, you know, it's new territory.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:46.700
 I haven't sequenced anything like this ever on any hardware or computer before in my life.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.700
 Now, does that do the simple stuff simple?

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:52.380
 Like, could you not, not that this would be the, the module to get,

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:57.820
 but can you start from simple and then get progressively more and more weird and complex?

01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.660
 You can to a degree.

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:02.140
 It doesn't lend itself well to normal.

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:02.780
 You know what I mean?

01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:11.100
 Like, you don't have, I mean, it's set up on a grid in like 16 steps.

01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:14.860
 So it looks familiar like XOX style sequencing.

01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:16.700
 This feels like it might be a ruse though.

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:17.180
 It is.

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.700
 And you're not going to go beyond that.

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:24.220
 Like, there's not like, you can't extend that to like 32 or, you know, 64 steps.

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:28.380
 Like, you're on that 16 grid, but it doesn't go beyond.

01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:32.300
 It goes in deeper, like meta within each step.

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:32.940
 You know what I mean?

01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.860
 So that's where it starts to get strange.

01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:38.540
 You're getting into this microcosm of fucking complex rhythms,

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:44.540
 steps within steps that you can expand or compress down the density.

01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:45.740
 So it's really strange.

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:49.900
 Like, if you wanted to do like a straightforward 909 sequence or some ratcheting,

01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:55.020
 you could dial that in fairly easily, but like, it's not the right format for that.

01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:55.660
 You know what I mean?

01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.660
 I wouldn't even say you can do the simple stuff simple.

01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:59.980
 It's like more geared towards complex stuff.

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:04.460
 So if you're going to do something simple, it's not the simplest way.

01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:05.100
 That's for sure.

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.220
 Oh, you know what I mean?

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:06.620
 Gotcha.

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:06.860
 Yeah.

01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:07.180
 Yeah.

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:07.820
 That makes sense.

01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:12.060
 Like, you would want to stick with like a beatstep pro or something like that.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:12.620
 You know what I mean?

01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:16.060
 Like, this thing, it's not an all-in-one.

01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:19.740
 It's not like, oh, I could get this instead of a beatstep pro and take things further.

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.660
 Like, you're not going to want to do that.

01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:22.540
 That's what I was getting at.

01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:27.260
 Like, this is not going to be the ultimate sequencer that you would get that replaces everything.

01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:27.740
 No.

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:30.780
 My mind, you kind of want it when you want to break time a little more.

01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:31.260
 Exactly.

01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:31.580
 Okay.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:35.740
 That's, it's about like doing complicated roles.

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:35.980
 Sure.

01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:39.900
 Like, if you want to call it a role, it's like more than that.

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:40.220
 Yeah.

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:46.380
 It's definitely a niche product and it's going to appeal to very specific types of people.

01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:53.980
 And I think a lot of people may have bought into the hype train not realizing what that

01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:55.420
 ticket entailed.

01:27:55.420 --> 01:28:00.380
 I wouldn't be surprised if we see a handful of these start popping up used, you know what I mean?

01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:01.100
 Yeah.

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:05.420
 So they, so as they start popping up used, who would you say should look into this?

01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:07.580
 Breakcore people.

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:14.940
 People who are into like anything with a complex beat structure.

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:15.580
 You know what I mean?

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:18.860
 Like, I wouldn't say this is a techno sequencer.

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:22.780
 I would say this is someone who wants to make blast beats or integrate it into their fucking

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:29.020
 metal band, like Eigor and have like a blend of break core and meets metal and fast paced,

01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:31.980
 you know, complex beats.

01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:35.100
 Anything of that, right?

01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.340
 Anything like, it doesn't have to be fast either.

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:37.900
 You know what I mean?

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:42.780
 Like, I was generating some weird abstract slower tempo stuff as well and like spacing out

01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:45.420
 rhythm points within the step, you know what I mean?

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:48.540
 So like, so how many outputs does it have?

01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:50.780
 Like you've got, you've got this sort of like grid.

01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:54.940
 Is it outputting one gate or is it multiple gates?

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:58.060
 So I tried to, yeah, I tried to cover that briefly.

01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:00.940
 I think in the previous episode, I may have was one before that when we were just like

01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:04.220
 given an overview of it, you know, talking about the hype of it.

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:06.860
 So you get four channels.

01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:12.700
 Each channel has your main gate track and then it has two auxiliary tracks

01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:16.620
 and then it has a CV track for each channel.

01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:27.100
 So in total, that's 16 outputs per, you know, in total for each channel.

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.660
 So it can get very complex.

01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:33.580
 Like you don't even need to progress to like channel two if you don't want

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:41.100
 because you have your main and three, you know, auxiliaries basically on, you know, channel one.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:41.420
 Right.

01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:46.060
 Yeah, I would say anyone that wants to dive into like Nick said,

01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:52.300
 you want to bend time or fuck with it, you know, you want to go faster or slower than your standard

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:55.740
 XOX style sequencing can typically allow even with ratchets.

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:56.140
 You know what I mean?

01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:56.460
 Yeah.

01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:57.660
 You want to go beyond that.

01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:02.620
 But you would expect them to be sending these to envelopes on drums.

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:03.260
 Absolutely.

01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:05.740
 Or could you think of it going to other things other than that?

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:06.300
 Oh yeah.

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:10.220
 I mean, if you're the type of dude who's doing like some seriously deep IDM stuff,

01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:10.780
 you know what I mean?

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:13.100
 And you got a lot of logic going on.

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:17.820
 This thing is like kind of like the ultimate sequencer to, I guess, jive with that.

01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:18.220
 You know what I mean?

01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:20.860
 Like you have complex things triggering logic.

01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:22.940
 It doesn't have to be triggering drums, you know what I mean?

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:25.980
 Like this is a straight up gate sequencer.

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:31.100
 You don't necessarily want to think about it as the sequencer that is triggering your beats,

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:35.980
 but maybe triggering your modulations, your logic, you know what I mean?

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:36.620
 Yeah, yeah.

01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:41.340
 Being combined in other ways and triggering all kinds of other things that are

01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:45.500
 affecting your drums or even other sequencers.

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:45.980
 You know what I mean?

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:51.900
 Like totally drive sequencers with this thing in weird ways that you normally wouldn't.

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:57.180
 And like the guy demonstrated in some of the Kickstarter videos,

01:30:57.180 --> 01:31:00.220
 you can even use this as an audio engine.

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:00.700
 You know what I mean?

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:06.700
 Like you get the gates going at audio rate and you can literally start making

01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:09.420
 drones, you know what I mean?

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:09.740
 Like...

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:11.900
 Is it like a square wave oscillator at that point?

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:17.660
 You could do it as a square wave oscillator or you could just sequence like things at audio rate

01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:21.580
 and have them start behaving weird ways and like, you know,

01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:22.940
 hyper drones and shit.

01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:25.660
 It's a very, very strange piece of kit.

01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:29.420
 It's weird to describe.

01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:33.500
 Like I've never felt something that felt so immediate and yet so intimidating

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:37.500
 by the sheer amount of open-ended possibility.

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.380
 Yeah, you know.

01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:39.180
 No power in there.

01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:39.420
 Yeah.

01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:42.860
 I mean, I jived with it like immediately.

01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:47.020
 I was able to douse and stuff it in, but at the same time I felt like I'm not

01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:50.220
 gonna wrap my head around this anytime soon in its entirety.

01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:51.020
 I like it.

01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:52.220
 I have no regrets buying it.

01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:54.620
 It's exactly what I expected and more.

01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:55.180
 You know what I mean?

01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:59.260
 Like I'm not feeling disappointed or frustrated with it.

01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.140
 Like some might be.

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:04.380
 I felt like I kind of understood what the point was from the Kickstarter.

01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:04.620
 Yeah.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:05.020
 Yeah.

01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:05.340
 Yeah.

01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:05.820
 Yeah.

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:10.540
 There are a little bit of frustrating things with the firmware itself.

01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:13.020
 Like it doesn't feel like a finished product.

01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:15.260
 That was my opinion of it when I wrote these notes.

01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:21.980
 Yesterday and then I saw the designer himself weigh in on the muff wiggler thread today

01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:23.580
 and basically said the same thing.

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:26.460
 He said, you know, this is like late stage beta.

01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:29.660
 There's still a lot of things that I'm cooking up, you know, and he's been listening to

01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:31.340
 feedback and the thread and other people.

01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:37.900
 There's been one firmware release since he started shipping these out and the next one

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:40.380
 is close, you saying?

01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:40.700
 Okay.

01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.780
 It's gonna add some things that'll make it less frustrating.

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:45.340
 Like currently in its form,

01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:52.460
 there's like three pages of parameters and there's no way to quickly get from like

01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:55.500
 your first thing on page one to the last thing on page three.

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.220
 Oh, you gotta cycle.

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:57.100
 You gotta go through them.

01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:59.020
 You can't even cycle the pages.

01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:01.900
 You literally have to scroll through everything on page one.

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:02.300
 Oh, Jesus.

01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:05.260
 Then everything on page two and then everything on page three.

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:05.660
 Yeah.

01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:08.780
 And they'll and included in that is all the quantization options,

01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:14.060
 all the modulation grid shit and it's like it's a little cumbersome going back and forth.

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:18.380
 But he's gonna add the option when you hold the accelerate button and then scroll,

01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:22.540
 it'll jump page, which will be more efficient.

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:23.980
 Just little things like that.

01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:24.620
 You know what I mean?

01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:30.620
 Also, when you power it on, it's automatically running and it doesn't remember your clock settings.

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:34.460
 Like they're gonna change that to remember that at power off.

01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:39.180
 If I set it to external clock, it's gonna remember that and it's not going to be automatically running

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:40.140
 when I power it on.

01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:44.540
 There's little things like that that could use some tweaking that he said he's already aware of.

01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:46.540
 But those aren't like catastrophic bugs.

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:48.140
 No, so far it feels stable.

01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:52.860
 It feels well thought out and implemented.

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.940
 You know, I have no major complaints.

01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:59.820
 I haven't encountered any, you know, game breaking bugs or anything like that.

01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:05.100
 It's just little tweaks that you can tell this thing is going to evolve, you know?

01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:05.420
 Yeah.

01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:09.900
 I would say that is enticing to me and also like completely worrisome though in the same way

01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:15.340
 because I'm so tired of like late betas that never kind of close out and things that are like,

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:19.980
 you really couldn't set the bit flag so that it wouldn't automatically play when you turned it on.

01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:20.780
 Like shit like that.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:24.780
 It's like I get it, but it's also like, all right, you got this dude?

01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:27.020
 You don't want to get involved in another project.

01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.740
 Another fluxes one, another, you know.

01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:32.460
 Honestly, that's why I just sold the Bibo a couple of days ago too.

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:33.420
 Oh yeah.

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:35.420
 I love the Bibo slash digit.

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:38.460
 I think we talked about it a little bit.

01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:39.020
 Yeah, we did.

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:39.500
 Yeah.

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:40.220
 Yeah.

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:46.380
 But yeah, same thing like that the guy who's making it poly effects or whatever,

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.940
 he's been making changes on like a weekly basis.

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.620
 And on one hand, I'm like, that's awesome.

01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:52.460
 Like he's totally expanding on his thing.

01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:54.380
 He's listening to people's feedback.

01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:55.820
 He's blowing it out.

01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:59.820
 But on the other hand, like, I don't want to have to relearn this thing every fucking week.

01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:00.460
 Yeah.

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:04.300
 You know, and I don't want to have to go through the hassle of updating it every fucking week.

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:05.420
 So I'm like, you know what?

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:06.700
 I'm going to pass on this for now.

01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:09.900
 I'll circle back to it in a few months down the road.

01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:10.700
 Makes sense.

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:15.580
 And mainly I was excited for it as a live processing machine for like performances,

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:17.420
 which isn't happening right now anyway.

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:20.620
 So I was like, okay, I'll just circle back to this a bit.

01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:27.020
 But yeah, so far it doesn't, flux doesn't feel like it's in that state.

01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:30.140
 It feels like he just got sidetracked with the fact that he was,

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:33.740
 he's a prompt dude and he wanted to meet the deadline of the Kickstarter.

01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:38.220
 So we got it as complete as possible, added in a bunch of stuff during the Kickstarter process

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:43.340
 and is now assembling and shipping them out, which is keeping his hands filled for now.

01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:43.660
 Sure.

01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:49.100
 And he's going to do a few patches down the road that will help balance things out a little more.

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:50.780
 It seems reasonable though.

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:52.860
 I mean, that doesn't seem, it seems like a lot of

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:57.020
 those are bugs you can live with type of thing or those are UX

01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:03.020
 oddities that are not great, but sure.

01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:05.660
 And I think that is also why there's no manual current.

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:10.220
 I'm not a manual dude typically.

01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:13.420
 I only refer to him when there's something I can't figure out on my own.

01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:15.660
 I don't start at the manual.

01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:18.860
 I start with the module and then I reference it as needed.

01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:22.140
 This was the first time in a long time where I was like,

01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:26.540
 I'm going to set aside an afternoon when this thing shows up.

01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:31.260
 And I'm going to read that fucking manual front to back before I power this thing on.

01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:35.580
 And then I opened the box and while it was a great looking package and came with stickers and

01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:38.860
 everything looked nice, I saw the little quick start guide and I was like,

01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:39.500
 "Fuck."

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:42.700
 This is not going to cover it.

01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:47.340
 And I was like, maybe there's one online and I looked, no, it just doesn't exist yet.

01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:49.660
 That is not for me then.

01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:50.220
 Yeah.

01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:55.900
 I read manuals and instruction books for games that I don't intend to ever play.

01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:59.660
 I read manuals before I get modules.

01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:03.740
 That kind of sent a chill up my spine.

01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:05.340
 You got to document that shit.

01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:05.740
 Yeah.

01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:08.460
 So, but you've been able to figure it out without.

01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:09.900
 I've been able to figure out some stuff.

01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:10.220
 Okay.

01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:15.660
 I'm navigating and some things that I couldn't figure out turn out just don't exist yet.

01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:21.420
 Like I couldn't figure out how to copy and paste between channels or even between steps.

01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:26.540
 Like I wanted to make like eight steps of the same thing and then create variances between them.

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:30.060
 Because it's a lot of work to configure one step.

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:30.700
 Sure, sure.

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:35.740
 And I was like, okay, I'm going to configure this one step and then bang out a few copies

01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:36.860
 and then adjust as needed.

01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:38.220
 You just can't do that currently.

01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:42.700
 And I didn't know that until I read the thread today that that is a thing that other

01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:46.060
 people were complaining about and that he's going to address in the next firmware.

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:46.780
 So it's coming.

01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:48.940
 But yeah, it's just simple things like that.

01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:52.380
 Like you have no idea, like, am I just not figuring it out?

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:52.620
 Right.

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:54.140
 Or does it not exist yet?

01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:56.460
 Yeah, so it's kind of up in the air a bit.

01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:00.540
 It sounds like you have confidence though that this is imminent and not

01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:02.780
 shit you have to live with forever.

01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:08.620
 Oh no, yeah, I mean, like I said, I kind of started shaping my rig for the last couple months

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:10.860
 around the concept of having this thing.

01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:16.620
 You know, and now that I have it, yeah, it's exactly as I anticipated.

01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:23.660
 You know, it's, and I still am going to consider it the brain of my new modular drum machine.

01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:24.780
 You know, set up.

01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:28.700
 Again, like I don't think there's anything like it.

01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:31.420
 There probably won't be again anytime soon.

01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:36.220
 It's just, it's interesting to me.

01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:41.740
 I'm a big fan of rhythmic structures and I think this is the ultimate rhythmic sequencer.

01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:45.900
 Now, do you feel like it's making you think, like you said, it sort of clear

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:49.260
 mind about like, I know rhythms and I know how be it's work?

01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:52.220
 Do you think it's changing the way you're thinking about rhythm?

01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:52.860
 Absolutely.

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:53.340
 Yeah.

01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:54.220
 That's cool.

01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:56.140
 I mean, just watching the demos kind of was.

01:38:56.140 --> 01:39:01.260
 I was like, okay, I didn't even know you could do that in a modular, you know, like thinking about it.

01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:03.580
 Like, now you can.

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:08.860
 And like I said before, like I was trying to achieve similar things to what it can do

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:12.380
 using a lot more modules, you know, over the last few years.

01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:20.220
 And this is all an all-in-one solution of logic and gate delays, you know, curvature and the whole

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:27.500
 nine fucking yards. So yeah, I think it's like the dream sequencer I've been waiting for.

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:54.780
 [Music]

01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:56.100
 There you go.
