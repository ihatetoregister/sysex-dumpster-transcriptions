WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.300
 Yeah, episode 33.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.140
 Woo-woo.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.080
 And judging by the stats,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.760
 we have a lot of new listeners.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.600
 Mm.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.960
 Welcome and sorry.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.800
 Sorry.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.960
 Yeah, this is mostly apologies.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.020
 And somehow you all have fallen down

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.200
 this dark dank rabbit hole with us.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.400
 They need to take a look in the mirror

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.000
 and ask themselves where they went wrong.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.440
 Yeah, how did you end up here?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.280
 Right, right.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.120
 Because.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.840
 Right, in the dumpster.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.680
 Yeah.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.760
 Piping hot trash.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.120
 Oh, we do here's each shipping fees

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.680
 from swapping out modules.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.320
 And just bitch about electron.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.160
 Yeah.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.600
 It's welcome.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.840
 Actually, I don't think we have anything

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.040
 about electron this time.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.880
 So yeah, yeah, we do.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.720
 Do we?

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.560
 Oh, we do.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.360
 Well, I thought you were gonna talk about the machine drum.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.720
 The machine drum for a more.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.040
 I have a chance to install it.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.480
 I'm still wrapping my head around the X dot 04

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.480
 that we talked about last time.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.280
 I haven't even had a chance to install five.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.200
 I'm excited to, but that'll be another episode, I think.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.040
 Okay, sure.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.360
 You can go home electron.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.800
 You can fuck out of your electron.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.720
 Fuck out of the room.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.680
 Tired talking about you.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.640
 So without, without electron,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.040
 what could we possibly talk about?

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.800
 Is there anything else?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.040
 That's not true.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.720
 We all, we have copious notes.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.320
 It's October.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.480
 Yeah, we have a, we have copious notes each of us.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.480
 It's October.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.760
 Mm hmm.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.240
 Besides, you know, that being spooky month.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.080
 Mm hmm.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.320
 And, you know, pumpkin spice to everything.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.880
 From your craft beer to your CBD infused cookies.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.880
 Mm hmm.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.880
 Yes.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.040
 You know, it's a month of anticipation and excitement.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.800
 Mm hmm.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.040
 If you're into gear and modulars day.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.680
 October follows up knob con.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.480
 That's true.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.360
 And super booth.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.440
 Mm hmm.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.080
 Exciting times day.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.720
 Were those both pumpkin spiced?

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.720
 They were as artificially spicy and pumpkin-y as can be.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.440
 As far as pumpkin spice is concerned.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440
 Mm hmm.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.440
 Like where are you?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.400
 Are you a fan of the pumpkin-spiced insert object?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.240
 No.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.240
 No.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.240
 Not at all.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.440
 I can drink one of them.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.920
 Like a 4121 they had a pumpkin spice.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.200
 They're like, no, this one's good.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.320
 I tried it and it was good.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.600
 I won't get it again.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.920
 I like the taste of pumpkin pie.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.040
 And in autumn, I will usually indulge

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.400
 in a pumpkin pie or two.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.240
 Yeah.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.080
 Yeah.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.960
 That's where I get my pumpkin delight from.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.000
 I don't really like anything else, man.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.840
 I've tried.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.360
 I'm just like that.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.200
 Yeah.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.360
 I don't understand it.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.360
 I mean, don't get me wrong.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.200
 I love the fall.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.760
 I love Halloween.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.040
 Love October in particular.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.240
 But the pumpkin spice thing, I just, I don't know.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.240
 Never understood.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.720
 I like seeing all the normal people act a little bit

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.480
 spooky and gothy for a month.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.320
 Yeah.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.160
 You know, that's cool.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.000
 You don't think they're posers.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.240
 Everyone's got a little bit of goth inside them somewhere.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.000
 It's nice to see them let it out.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Yeah.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.160
 It's acceptable for a month.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.720
 But pumpkin spice thing, I don't understand where that comes from.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.800
 I mean, it's a way to sell shit.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.320
 Yeah.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.920
 I mean, that's the cynical view of it.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.000
 And as someone basically, I may have mentioned this

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.800
 in a previous episode, but like Halloween's really the only

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.600
 holiday I celebrate.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.680
 Everything else is trash.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.560
 Like it's proper goth.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.640
 And to be clear, everyday is Halloween for me.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.080
 Exactly.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.400
 But more specifically--

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400
 Thank you.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.800
 Bump, bump, bump.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.240
 But more specifically, October, I feel, as if that whole month

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.720
 really encapsulates everything that I love about it.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.640
 The problem I've been having, and you sort of touched on a little bit

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.160
 there, is finding a good pumpkin beer.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.520
 Yeah, I'm off that.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.280
 There used to be pretty good ones that were disgustingly

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.200
 filled with spice and sugar, and it just tasted like pumpkin

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.280
 and beer.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.040
 And now everything is just--

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.440
 like basically could come from Starbucks.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.520
 Yeah, I don't think I can go there again with the pumpkin

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.720
 spice beer.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.640
 Yeah, I can't.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.960
 And I'm thinking actually, too, now that I think about it,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.480
 maybe pumpkin spice is the scariest thing about October,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.080
 because it's just wretched.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.720
 Yeah.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.080
 Yeah.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.160
 It's the thing that you find in that little piece of obsidian

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.560
 that you think is your soul.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.560
 Like when it gets cold out, and you see a scary movie,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.280
 and you feel good about yourself again, but you are afraid.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.440
 Don't know why.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.120
 Take a sip of that pumpkin spice latte.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.680
 Curl up on the sofa.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.400
 Fucking die.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.760
 Jesus.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.680
 That just came out.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.360
 I heard the new Halloween movie is coming out soon,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.520
 and Michael Myers doesn't use a butcher knife anymore.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.000
 What?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.640
 No.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.200
 He uses pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.360
 You have him for a second.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.800
 I can't believe he uses like--

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.160
 he has safety scissors.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.240
 That was the best part of that.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.680
 Was watching you run like leaning in.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.760
 Wait, what the hell?

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.640
 Just throws lukewarm latte at you from Starbucks.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.800
 Oh, god.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.000
 As you're walking down the street,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.200
 it's calling your name like a barista at Starbucks.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.680
 Your order is up.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.600
 Drave, drave, here's your drink.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.280
 The cup says drave on the side, even though you said dave.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.040
 Very clearly.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.040
 Good.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.000
 Yeah, October.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.840
 October.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.160
 Yeah, it's happening.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.400
 And my other complaint about October--

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.000
 I mean, I got a lot of complaints about everything--

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.160
 is it's so fucking warm.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.040
 This is not my October.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.000
 Still very much summer weather right now.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.040
 The leaves haven't even dropped.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.680
 Now, like most of them haven't turned.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.400
 I was in Virginia.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.160
 Most of those shits were green or like poisoned, like not good.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.360
 And they were like, yeah, it's all fucked up,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.440
 because of weather.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.400
 I'm kind of happy about that, though.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.560
 Because we're going down to West Virginia in a few weeks.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.560
 And last, I think, two times we went on air.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.040
 We missed the leaves changing the wind storms,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.160
 just kind of blew them off before we could see them

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.840
 to point the fall.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.280
 And this time, it seems like since we're changing slowly,

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.120
 there might still be--

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.560
 it might be a nice display for us.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.440
 You found the incredibly micro-thin silver lining

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.720
 to global warming.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.800
 Is that it'll be convenient for a vacation

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.480
 that we're going on.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.280
 A couple years back.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.640
 I think it was about four years back.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.680
 It was exceptionally warm, even like this.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.840
 And I went down to the mountains in November.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.360
 And the leaves were still on the trees,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.920
 and we're still colorful.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.120
 And it was awesome.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.280
 Yeah.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.600
 Because, yeah, I don't know.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.880
 I just like to see that.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.200
 It's my favorite time to go down there.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, to learn to stand.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.600
 And it sucks to go down there and just see everything.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.640
 Just bear trees.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.880
 It's like, what?

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.760
 See that?

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.040
 I understand what you're saying.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.600
 And I do love the good--

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.720
 the changing of the leaves and the colors and all that stuff.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.960
 I'm also a huge fan of just barren trees

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.320
 against a gray background.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.720
 That is my shit.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.080
 It's cold out in my go-out side,

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.280
 and like I breathe in a big lung full of cold brisk air.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.200
 And I look out and there's just death for 50 miles

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.720
 in every direction.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.840
 That is kind of my shit.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.400
 See, if all leaves change and dude,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.040
 I don't know, just trigger something in my brain.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.280
 Like puts me in a certain state of mind.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.600
 And I can only get into like once a year.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.280
 Yeah, agreed.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.680
 What do we talk about, modules and--

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.440
 It's October, so now we get to look forward to all of the shit

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.640
 that was announced, knob con, super booth.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.440
 It won't be out for months and months.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.240
 Yeah, do we get in 2025?

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.720
 Yeah.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.880
 Coming out and end of fourth quarter, 2022.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.040
 But we get to see it now in October, Dave.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.520
 Yeah.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.000
 The lead time in the past had always been like a couple months.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.080
 But that was still always a little bit like, ah, I want it now.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.600
 And now it's like, fuck, I just hope this ever gets made.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.320
 Yeah.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.400
 It's the one thing Barandrick kind of fucked up

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.200
 is like, does that shit even exist?

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.000
 I think a lot of people just gave up

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.600
 trying to see if that 909 or 808 is going to come out.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.040
 Yeah.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.760
 Maybe they are.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.440
 Who fucking knows?

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.680
 The cheapest years ago.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.880
 Who even cares?

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.280
 Like the hype train left the station

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.720
 for years ago at this point.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.440
 I saw some people got some of the barbs, apparently.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.920
 But I'm like, what did they have?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.360
 Like, five of them, and that's it for another six months.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.040
 Yeah.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.240
 There are a couple of those out there.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.080
 I've seen some videos come out from people.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.320
 Like, ebotronics had two of the meanies, I guess.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.080
 Wow.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.920
 OK.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.760
 Good for him.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.720
 I wonder how many things we've had to go back to the drawing

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.160
 board, because I mean, a friend of the podcast,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.400
 Russ from Ebiton was telling us that one of the designs he

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.760
 was working on, the chip for it, discontinued.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.280
 Right.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.640
 That's unobtainium.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:10.920
 Yeah.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.160
 So now he has to go back and figure out

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.240
 how to do this with a different chip.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.720
 And hopefully, that one doesn't magically become

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.320
 unavailable.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.280
 Like, yeah, it's real.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:20.520
 Yeah.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.280
 So I mean, it's not just a simple shortage,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.200
 but now this is done.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.240
 That was one thing that was kind of puzzling to me.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.720
 It was how much new stuff was announced.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.560
 And I'm like, really?

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.560
 Yeah.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.060
 All right.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.680
 Is there just going to be six of these in existence?

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.200
 Right.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200
 Yeah.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.200
 Yeah.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.200
 So it's hard to get hyped up when you know that everything

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.600
 that we just saw announced is going to be months down the road.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.720
 And we have no idea what the availability is going to be

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.960
 even when it is officially released.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.480
 Right.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.480
 Yeah.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.480
 I mean, it's like, I feel like everything's just going to be out

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:51.960
 of stock.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.600
 And it's like, we have no idea how many are actually going

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.680
 to be available.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.560
 Do you think this is the result of everyone being

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.360
 in quarantine for the last 18 months?

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.200
 And a lot of these designers sitting there going like, OK,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.080
 now's my chance to dive in and design these and finish

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.240
 these and actually get them probably through prototype

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.280
 and actually into quasi production.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.920
 So it does seem like there was a huge explosion of all

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.080
 of these people going, here's all the stuff I've been working on.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.320
 And because it was like two, three years ago,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.800
 where we're discussing the lack of innovation that we were seeing.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.360
 True.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.320
 You know, like, and the lack of new stuff being announced

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.440
 at like, knob con, man, super booth.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.560
 It just seemed like a lot of the same old, same old for a couple

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:29.920
 of years.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.520
 And then also this year, it was just like, glam.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.040
 Yeah.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.120
 There's a lot of interesting shit being announced.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.280
 Yeah, there was that shortage.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.400
 But somehow we're all beeds up now, too.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:39.600
 Yeah.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.680
 Because that seemed a year later.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:40.920
 Yeah.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.360
 For a while.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.720
 Yeah, I guess that it's been a full year.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.320
 Wow.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.840
 I did the pre-order for it.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.080
 It was about a year ago.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.560
 Yeah.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.720
 Yeah.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:48.880
 Yeah.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.120
 I put that in my notes.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.200
 Like, it's taken us all a year to get beads finally.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200
 Yeah.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.440
 Because I think I canceled my original pre-order in February

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.400
 when I was like, this is just not happening.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.640
 And us getting them recently was actually, I think, just pure luck.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.000
 Right.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.640
 Because it was sold out two days later from where we got ours.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.200
 And everywhere else, it's still on pre-order once again.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.240
 So I think we just got lucky with our purchasing timing.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.720
 I was taking a look around at knob con.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.480
 And it didn't seem like there was as many announcements

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.720
 or just really that many people at knob con.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.600
 So does anybody actually have any notes from that event?

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.160
 A little bit.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.680
 Yeah.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.400
 Not many.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.680
 Just-- I mean, I guess it's worth mentioning.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.840
 We didn't go this year, which is probably like the first--

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.720
 well, aside from last year, because it didn't exist.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.400
 It's the first one that they had that we didn't go to.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.400
 We didn't go to, yeah.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.520
 But people did go.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.960
 It did happen.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.440
 I saw pictures and videos coming out from it.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.760
 The most noteworthy thing I took away from it

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.800
 was the industrial music electronics announcements.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.440
 That's all I really took away from it.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.840
 Aside from seeing other stuff, that's

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.400
 what I remember from the videos.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.480
 That's what I wanted to see.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:14.000
 We finally caught a glimpse of Volkmeyer's Inferno.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.160
 Scott's take on a granular synth.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.640
 And also, Stilson Hammer Mark III prototype,

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.040
 the sequencer, which I'm kind of excited about.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.480
 But not a whole lot of info.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.120
 Like, I don't even think we know when Volkmeyer's going

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.240
 to be out.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.560
 No.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.200
 But it looks cool.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.760
 Yeah.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.040
 And I'm excited for more details.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.360
 The--

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.560
 The Andre 2.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.560
 Yeah, and the--

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.960
 Yeah, the single Andre.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.000
 Andre Jr. Yeah.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.720
 Yeah, it's-- yeah.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.120
 Like, I pull up the notes here from Nopon,

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.720
 people who were there, who talked to Scott,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.280
 so you know, features are still unknown.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.960
 Which is surprising, at least for the Andre,

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.280
 because the prototype was a couple years old now.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.280
 Yeah.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.280
 We have the parameters that we can see on the prototype,

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.440
 but those might change.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:15.840
 We have controls for pitch, speed, start, and sample--

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.560
 or start and for the sample, density, size, variation,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.080
 alt, random feedback.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.440
 So some of these sound a little familiar to the time Safari.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.600
 So I wonder if Volkmeyer's just kind of like a time

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.480
 Safari on steroids, more granular-based--

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.840
 because you could kind of get granular with the time Safari.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.680
 You could definitely do time stretching and shit like that.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.240
 If you modulated it properly, but you were only

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.720
 messing with one grain.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.680
 Aside from that, I didn't see much from Nopon that really caught

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.280
 my eye.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:50.960
 Same here.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.560
 It seemed like a lot of people waited for Superbooths to make.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.060
 Yeah.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.560
 Yeah.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:54.920
 And it's meant--

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.880
 Definitely.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.080
 But before we dip into like Superbooth shit,

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.640
 Nicky brought up beads.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.800
 Should we dip into beads?

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.400
 Because now we all recently caught one

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.120
 with Labor Day coupon codes.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.280
 Finally got one.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.200
 Do we really want to blow this up and let people know

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.040
 that these coupon codes are still working?

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.680
 I mean, I guess they're probably figuring out,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.400
 because they're not going to use much money, but like--

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.480
 I feel like the retailer that we purchase from

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.720
 doesn't give anything to us.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.160
 We don't have any coupon codes.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.640
 We don't have any kickbacks.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.400
 So I'm not really inclined to give them a shout out, personally.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.560
 I don't want them to fix it is what I'm thinking.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.360
 Oh, exactly.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.320
 Like, I don't want to blow up our spot.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.400
 Yeah, that's the thing.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.240
 There is sometimes where I swear I've bought something.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.040
 And I was like, I know that they look at that order.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.200
 And they're like, god damn it.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.840
 Because it's like a brand new thing

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.680
 that you just got $60 off of or something like that.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.440
 I love coupon codes.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.320
 I love digging up coupon for everything

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.360
 that I buy online now.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.840
 Yeah, same.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.760
 You find one that's like several months old

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.520
 that they forgot to delete and still works.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.280
 It's like, yeah, it's such a rush.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.920
 I'm sticking it to the man.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.720
 Do you flip physical coupons for grocery stores or something?

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.080
 No, but I feel like this is the equivalent.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.800
 Yeah, it's a game.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.840
 I'm a queue code clipper.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.760
 Wait, what were we talking about?

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.800
 We'd cycle it out.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.120
 There's some weird shit there.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.360
 But I forget where we came from.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.120
 Coupon codes.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.120
 Yeah, coupon codes and beads.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120
 Thank you.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.120
 Coupon codes and beads.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.120
 So not only did we all get beads,

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.160
 we got out of discount.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.160
 We did.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:26.600
 Yeah.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.360
 Labor Day coupons.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.600
 It's a delicious module, I'll say.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.400
 As somebody who had a couple clouds iterations

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.560
 and ended up banding them all,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.480
 I really liked the interface a lot more.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.320
 It makes a lot more sense to me.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.240
 I like the seed and the clocked input

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.240
 and the delay mode to always stick out to me.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.040
 And I'm getting a lot more from it than I was.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.640
 Clouds for a while.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.520
 It seems like YouTube had more luck

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.320
 or at least more time with monsoon and clouds

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.840
 than I have in more success.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.640
 Yeah, I skipped clouds entirely at first.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.480
 Not out of any sort of animosity or anything.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.560
 Look at all some ways.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.400
 I just didn't have a space.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.320
 There was a million reasons.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:06.680
 And then--

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.280
 I remember telling you you had to get a monsoon at one point.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:09.760
 Exactly.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.120
 And so then I jumped on monsoon.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.480
 And it's not left my case since.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.040
 It has a million uses.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.560
 And beads, because it doesn't have the sort of parasite

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.840
 alternate modes, isn't necessarily as versatile as monsoon

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.560
 for these different things you can do.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.120
 But what it does, I think it nails

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.800
 and is getting a lot more out of it

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:37.560
 than the base firmware version or the base functionality

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.640
 that monsoon had.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.200
 I think at one point I even made a bold declaration

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.640
 that I'm going to get rid of my monsoon when I get beads.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.800
 And now that is definitely not true.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.320
 I'm keeping the place for both.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.600
 New York, you know?

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.120
 Yeah, I remember.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.640
 I think it's part of our tradition of bold declarations

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.120
 that we later take back.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.000
 This was mine.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.440
 I'd like the clarity of it a lot compared to clouds,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.640
 which was I felt I would get smudgy things out of clouds

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.360
 that didn't play to what I was trying to do maybe.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.000
 So yeah, it's been a nice go-to.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 I need to spice something up a little non-typical effects way.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 And I really didn't realize just how much I was going to enjoy

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 those sort of random attenuator.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 I almost don't know if I like the randomization.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.240
 Really a ten-year-furgers as much after having it for a little.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.360
 Because it's hard to like kind of turn it off cleanly.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.080
 And I don't want its presence a lot.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.000
 I was going to touch on that as well.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.720
 I remember a few episodes back when we kind of did an overview

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.920
 when beads was announced.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.920
 I think I called the Tenureandomizer's Brilliant.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.920
 Yeah.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.920
 And now that I have the module and I've spent some time with it,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.920
 that's too much praise.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.920
 I think it's a good concept.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.920
 Would you like it better if there was an easier way to just turn it off

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.920
 and it just begun?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.920
 First off, I think those knobs should have a center,

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.920
 a detent, whatever, just so that, yeah, it would lock in place

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.920
 when you're at the 12 o'clock mark.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.920
 And you know that it's not applying any random series.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.920
 So it does seem to be some give there.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.920
 There's a bit of a blind spot before it takes effect,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.920
 but still it would be nice to have a very, you know,

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.920
 a spot with no doubt.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920
 Yeah.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.920
 I have some other minor complaints as well that I could do.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.920
 Yeah.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920
 See, I don't know.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.920
 First off, this is announced as like a mutable instrument's final module.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.920
 You know what I mean?

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.920
 I think it was probably the most hyped up sequel.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.920
 And in that regard, I feel like it kind of falls a little flat.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.920
 I feel like as like a grand finale, there needs to be more.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.920
 You know what I mean?

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.920
 Like you were saying, I've owned a couple of different versions of clouds

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.920
 and a couple of different monsoons.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.920
 At one point, I had three in my rack at a time.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:00.920
 The original clouds and all of its variations rather be monsoons

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.920
 or typhoons or whatever the fuck.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.920
 And whatever firmware, it feels like it's always been a Swiss Army knife for me.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.920
 Yeah.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.920
 For processing.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920
 Right.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.920
 This does not feel like a Swiss Army knife.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.920
 This feels a lot more focused, which I guess is good in some ways.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.920
 Hmm.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.920
 Now, did you feel like the original clouds that just had the base firmware?

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.920
 Did you have, did you still have that idea that it was a Swiss Army knife?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920
 That's cool.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.920
 Or did that change whenever you added parasites to it?

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.920
 Parasites just expands upon it.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.920
 You know, it takes what's there and takes it to like the next level.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.920
 A little bit in some regards, but it's still inherently clouds.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.920
 You know what I mean?

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.920
 Like I enjoyed clouds.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.920
 The factory model, I enjoyed clouds with parasite.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.920
 In fact, at one point, I had one with both.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.920
 I had one that was running factory firmware and one that was running parasite firmware.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.920
 Right.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:52.920
 Um, beads kind of feels like they learned from the parasite firmware.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.920
 And I was like, okay, yeah, let's add this.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.920
 For example, the envelope grains.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.920
 Yeah.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.920
 Yeah.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:05.920
 So it's not a major improvement in my opinion, you know, for something that's considered a

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.920
 sequel.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:16.920
 Um, now could you look at maybe instead of the, instead of looking at with that sort of grand

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.920
 view, more of this is like the game of the year edition.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.920
 Basically, it's more of a refinement of all of these things that came up to this.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.920
 This is the culmination of basically every bug fix and every new feature that was added

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.920
 and every conversation that they had about like, you know, what do people like and what

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.920
 people are not like?

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.920
 I would feel that way if it didn't take away from things.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:45.420
 Like even the factory version of clouds, I feel like had some things that were important

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.920
 that beads lacks such as like, like what?

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.920
 First thing off the top of my head is the grains.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.920
 Like you were saying how you could get smudgy with it.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.920
 Yeah.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:02.920
 So we're, we're particular envelope shapes that were very smudgy, very, um, diffused that

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.920
 I liked.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.920
 I could use that as almost like a pseudo reverb sometimes on certain source material.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.680
 That option is not there in beads at all.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.840
 Like it's very sharp.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:19.920
 Even if you pick like the triangle shape on beads, it's still very, um, what's the word?

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.160
 I don't want to say sharp, but very clear.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.160
 I knew it.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.920
 You know, I mean, it's like very defined.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.920
 It's very defined.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:31.560
 There is nothing in there that will achieve that diffused shape the clouds have that I

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.960
 liked a lot, you know, um, all the shapes on beads kind of feel a little redundant to

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960
 me.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.600
 Like there's not a lot of variance between them.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.680
 Like it just goes from sharp to not quite as sharp, you know what I mean?

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:48.480
 Like there's a little bit of attack there in the triangle one, but not nothing crazy

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.720
 to me that like allows for more unique shaping of the grains.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.240
 I was like, I've liked the shape feature so far because I've been seething that and getting

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.600
 like weird rhythmic shit and doing that.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.080
 But I completely know what you mean where like there was a more diffused field of the

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.560
 grains and clouds, whether it was because of eight bit or 16 bit, probably not, but

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.880
 maybe something like that felt like that with beads.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:20.600
 They feel more glassy or like clear and like the alt modes too is a big, big issue for

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.600
 me.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.200
 I loved all the different modes in clouds and the fact that this doesn't have any.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.880
 I mean, you can get seamlessly in and out of delay mode, which is cool.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.880
 That is nice.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.880
 Yeah.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.280
 It's real nice, but it's different than the delay mode was in parasite or the factory

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:43.520
 firmware and it's a little weird that you can't get into the original delay mode by any means.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:51.200
 And I think it's strange that they removed the other two modes as well.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.720
 Specifically the spectral FFT mode.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.240
 Yeah, absolutely loved that mode.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:03.200
 And I was really looking forward to see like how these other modes would evolve for beads.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.960
 And they don't exist at all.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.720
 And I think that's like a huge disappointment.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:14.200
 I feel like beads is just a quarter of the clouds that I know, you know what I mean?

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.720
 And I was hoping to see evolve.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720
 So I don't know.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.520
 I feel like the default granular mode, despite the lack of the diffuse mode is nice and a

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.520
 good improvement.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.720
 But the fact that you can't get into these other modes is like a huge disappointment for

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.720
 me personally.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.880
 Yeah, that's fair.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:37.920
 I do like the little color coded LED to show the audio quality selection modes.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.720
 That's nice touch.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.440
 What exactly those modes do, like even after reading the manual, I'm still not entirely

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.440
 clear on.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.160
 Like I don't hear major differences between them.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.160
 It's real subtle.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.160
 Yeah, it can be.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.160
 Like the scorched cassette mode, I had high hopes for with that.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.160
 I don't hear like much differences with that.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:02.840
 I think I did notice some differences with how the attendee randomizers work in that

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.520
 mode, which isn't explaining the manual anywhere.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.920
 If that is the case, or maybe that's just how my ears was detecting it, but it seemed

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:17.040
 to like change the behavior of the internal LFOs a bit.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.400
 And that's an issue for me too, like the lack of explanation between the new stuff,

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.400
 you know?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.160
 Do you think the manual was not?

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.880
 It's not as robust as I would like it to be.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.880
 That's for sure.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.480
 I think things need further explanation to really wrap your head around it.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.560
 I agree with the modes comment.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:41.840
 I think what she wanted to do obviously was like focus this down into some core of it.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.200
 But I would have, like most things would have preferred an expansion or a bigger module

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.000
 in general that had like spectral stuff surprised me that it wasn't integrated in there.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.040
 Because it is a big, like you said, it's a big part of the clouds being able to like

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.240
 get into that mode.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:03.600
 I think there was too much focus on interface and not enough focus on functionality.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.160
 And you can see that through the history of the, you know, that she published, like how

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:13.520
 the module went through different iterations before it finally became beads that we know.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.040
 And it seemed like a lot of that was just focusing on the interface and getting it down

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.160
 to a nice panel layout and everything that makes sense.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.160
 And that's cool.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.440
 I do like the interface.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.880
 I think it's nice.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.800
 But I also would have been totally okay with like a slightly bigger module with a few extra

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:35.320
 features on there, maybe a color coded button that select alternative modes, things like

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.280
 that, you know what I mean?

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:42.600
 And dedicated CV for everything like you can find on a monsoon.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.080
 Yeah.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:51.440
 I think the little, you know, the option to select one CV input to those three parameters.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.440
 Yeah.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.520
 That's actually, that was good.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.680
 That is the one that I have.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.360
 And that's my, that was the one complaint that I was going to bring up is I'd like the idea

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.760
 that you can then pick between a three in the combination.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.920
 So you're not just limited to sending it to one, which I think is like a nice shortcut

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.920
 around that.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:12.280
 Very rarely do I want to have the same CV going to those three destinations like that.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.280
 Yeah.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.560
 So having dedicated ones for each of those, if I had that choice or even like a Silicon

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.560
 expansion, I would have got that right away.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:24.440
 Whatever the reason was to keep it to just one, being able to have selections and then

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.720
 or combinations of them seem like a pretty decent workaround.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.480
 It's just not very useful for me.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.480
 Yeah.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.240
 And it's weird because that is something that you can get on a typhoon.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.240
 You know what I mean?

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.640
 Like, I'm not saying she should have copied typhoons.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.640
 You know what I mean?

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.160
 But like that was considered like the evolution of clouds.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.680
 To limit it to just one CV input that yeah, you can bounce around different things.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.680
 It's like why?

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.200
 Just make it another couple HP bigger and then you can have dedicated input jacks for

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.280
 all those parameters instead of having to choose.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.880
 Which is funny because it's again a situation where I think we all want like somewhat of

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.920
 make a different cloned version of it that has more expansion.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:14.280
 I, you know, that was like the final conclusion I came to.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.480
 Like I enjoy beads.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:23.240
 It has its place in my rack right now to accompany my typhoons and clouds modules but not to

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.320
 replace them.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:31.160
 And it's probably going to go the minute someone comes out with a third party version

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.160
 of beads.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160
 You know what I mean?

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.840
 That offers and you know more interesting things or alternate modes.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.680
 There's still room for somebody to make a new granular module that covers that stuff.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.920
 So you've you've you've list like a litany of problems with it.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.320
 Are you ultimately going to keep it?

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.320
 I mean is it something?

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.320
 Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.320
 I'm okay.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.320
 I keep it.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.320
 I feel like it's good.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:57.880
 It's a good module to accompany clouds and and typhoon and monsoon rather.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.000
 But to me it is not like a replacement.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 Absolutely.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 It's a lot of territory.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.680
 I'm also I'm getting a lot of great stuff out of it that is different than what I'm

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.880
 getting out of my suit.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.560
 I think ultimately that sounds like I'm having a more positive relationship with the the

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.560
 beats than you are.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.760
 I do like what I'm getting out of it.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:22.320
 I do like the clarity like you said like the the audio quality is noticeably improved.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.440
 Oh yeah, especially with some of the monsoons that I've had like some of those modules I've

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.960
 noticed get a little muddy a little shitty with the low end.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.840
 It just kind of loses some of the base and also even with higher pitch stuff there's

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.320
 clear aliasing even if you're in 16 bit mode.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:48.160
 So yeah, something with like the converters and beads in the modes that you can select

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.080
 sound significantly better to my ears at least.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.080
 Yeah.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.200
 I can run complex beats through it and I don't feel like I'm losing you know anything from

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:04.520
 the source which is nice very transparent and I do like being able to seamlessly blend

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:11.320
 from like normal mode into delay mode and then you know hit the clock with like strangely

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:16.680
 timed clocks and make things go crazy especially in like the beat repeat type of mode when you're

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.360
 freezing it while it's clocked in delay mode.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.360
 Fuck yeah.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.360
 Pretty nice.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.040
 That's what I wasn't going to get one until you made that clip with the delay mode type

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.640
 shit and I was like okay this is like very interesting and then when I got it I used

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.920
 it and I was like cool this is fun and I was like playing with it for half an hour

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.440
 and I was like what the fuck am I doing with this you know like kind of just like musically

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.320
 I'm like what are you what are you going to do with this thing and I was like on the

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.000
 edge of selling it I'm like cool I could sell this for what it is it's hard to get right

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.800
 now and then it was the delay mode shit and then I was like oh okay like I kind of know

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.800
 what I can do with this that isn't just a delay and it's just more like in my mind

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.240
 it locked and I'm like oh you're just kind of like spraying these things around in time

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.160
 and I'm like cool which I get like from granular stuff but it's all in how you approach it.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.160
 Sure.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.280
 And I have the R301 which can do a lot of this stuff already granted not like can't change

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.480
 the grain shapes quite as well and things like that so.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:18.160
 Even that mode is it's kind of based off of like that camera all exact repeat mode firmware

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:24.240
 which you know came out so it's interesting to see beads incorporating all the stuff that

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:32.720
 other people have kind of also devised as like you know ways for clouds to function.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.000
 I feel like it just doesn't take it to the next level enough for me to be like super

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.120
 super excited about it but I am having fun with it absolutely.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:46.320
 The other day I was slicing up some breaks on my poly and tracker and just running it

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.960
 through that mode and just having a fucking like break core fuck fest with it you know

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.120
 it was a blast but it works very well for that.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:01.840
 It kind of like if as rings is to elements they should do like what's the big you know

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.840
 brother of beads there's still like another module they could make there that would be.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.880
 Which someone did with clouds the super super.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:08.880
 Oh yeah yeah.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.240
 So yeah I would like to see the super cell version of beads absolutely.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.240
 Exactly.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.320
 So have we litigated beads enough?

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.320
 We've dragged it through the dirt.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.320
 Yeah.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.360
 Giving it praise and then chopped it back down shoved its face in the mud.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.280
 So you're not a little pretty little princess anymore are you?

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:36.120
 So does anybody have anything else that's not super booth related?

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.520
 Because all of the rest of my notes are super booth related.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.120
 I think we do.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.320
 Yeah we got some things there.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.760
 We got some bang.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.120
 Why being cagey?

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.000
 Why are you not telling me what they are?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 Why are you keeping our listeners?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 We are listeners.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.720
 We are the wheels of it for the listeners exactly.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.520
 I had something that I wanted to bring up real quick before we dip in a new shit.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.520
 Go for it.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.520
 I wanted to take a step back.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.520
 Oh.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.520
 To our previous episode.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.520
 Episode 32.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.880
 What did I say wrong in the 32?

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.120
 No you're fine.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.440
 But we did criticize or ice especially criticize the LXR2.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.520
 Oh yeah yeah.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:17.960
 And was really not into the fact that it lacked a lot of features that the original

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.280
 LXR had.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:27.480
 It was days after we put out that episode Erika Sense released a new firmware which kind

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.480
 of rectifies some of those complaints.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.600
 Do you think it was you?

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.080
 Do you think that they did it because of you?

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.080
 Absolutely.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.080
 That's 100% accurate.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.240
 It was all hands on deck.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:40.440
 We just heard a podcast where these features are missing.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.440
 We cannot disappoint them.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.000
 They might not even have known those features were missing.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 They might have forgotten.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.200
 They were like oh shit we just got called out by the 6x dumpster crew.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.320
 They had their emergency 9am meeting because we released the episode.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320
 They were all gathered.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.240
 We were like well we got to listen to it.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.160
 Imagine the panic that hit that room when we started talking about it.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.320
 They said no one's leaving this meeting room until we get this shit fixed.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.040
 Pronzo and then a few days later yeah.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:08.280
 They came out with the new 1.2 firmware.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:13.840
 It adds a lot of the stuff that I considered pretty important to the LXR.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.840
 Micro time.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:20.400
 Micro timing, ratchets, synth parameter editing and performance mode.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.640
 They say new effects and bunch of fixes on the website.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.480
 It's pretty fucking vague.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:33.360
 But yeah I'm curious to hear what those new effects and bunch of fixes are all about.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:38.680
 Maybe one of those fixes were fixes the bug that I saw were turning one knob made parameters

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.080
 change on a different map.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.520
 That would be a bit weird.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:50.080
 I returned mine so quickly because I was frustrated with it and just didn't feel like an LXR sequel

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.520
 to me.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:57.800
 This makes me consider getting it again and giving it another fair shot with these fixes.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.320
 I would like to see more details in the patch notes.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.520
 It doesn't give me 100% confidence that everything that I encountered within my short period

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.080
 of owning one has already been fixed.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.640
 Who's to say that you just didn't get a manufacturing problem?

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:15.000
 The right back should have been hardware problems that were causing what you have.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.760
 If you got it again you wouldn't run into them.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.160
 Basically having different hardware and these fixes might be the thing in the box that you're

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.160
 looking for.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.680
 Nothing that I encountered was game breaking.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.600
 It just was disappointing because on top of all the features that were missing from the

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:33.400
 original LXR that I was expecting to have in there, you just had these weird random little

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.400
 bugs and glitches.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.680
 I was just kind of like this.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.440
 This can go back to the store right now.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.240
 I'm not going to be dealing with this.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:44.520
 I feel like even with the original LXR I will get random weird glitches.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:52.320
 But I've always charged that up to me being a small company.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.000
 I made the kit that firmware has just been kind of abandoned.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.680
 There's almost my expectations for lower at some point and been like, "Well it didn't

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.680
 crash."

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.680
 I think I got lucky, but you hit yours with MIDI don't you?

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.680
 Yeah.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.320
 I have touched MIDI input online ever.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.280
 It's always just been a clock and that's it.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:17.000
 I think it's pretty known in some ways that if you send any MIDI data that's going to

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.840
 stack on there shit.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.720
 And having the 60 knobs on top of that.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.280
 And I also used to see the outs a lot.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:31.240
 Like the back of it, I'm putting it through its paces in a way that is probably just more

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.160
 likely to run into bugs.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.320
 That's one thing they claim they fixed in this new one is the clock input.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.320
 Oh cool.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320
 The analog clock input.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.200
 Yeah that is definitely a buggy piece of shit on the original.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.200
 Absolutely.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.040
 I thought I just built the expander incorrectly.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040
 Same here.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.840
 Yeah I remember saying, "Hey you up?" and I was like, "Hey man I can't get this work."

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.400
 You know like, "Yeah it just doesn't."

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.400
 Oh shit.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.400
 Okay.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.880
 I know I didn't solder something wrong.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:00.720
 Good on them for quickly releasing a new firmware.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.800
 That gives me the Mormon fuzzies that I was hoping I would get from Erica taking this

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.800
 over.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.280
 They're going to be super attentive to this.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.000
 They're going to be on top of it.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 They're going to make it great.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.320
 Well unfortunately though, all of those aren't available for the first version yet.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.880
 Yeah that's what I was just going to say.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.880
 I was trying to check their GitHub or anywhere.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.880
 Oh like backwards.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.880
 Yeah.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.880
 Which I said was going to be the case.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.120
 They said as they were moving forward that whenever they could.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.120
 I didn't even consider that.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:30.920
 Yeah whenever they could they were going to apply that to the original firmware.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.960
 Or for the firmware for the first version.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.960
 And so far I don't think that's happened at all.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.200
 Yeah well three days after this episode comes out we'll be expecting that new release.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.200
 Absolutely.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:47.720
 I apologize in advance to the developers who now have to work 24 hours a day under terrible

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.560
 conditions in order to meet our exacting demands.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.560
 That's right.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.560
 Yeah.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.200
 So if I stick stumps it will put you on blast.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.200
 Cancel culture.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.200
 Cancel culture.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.600
 Cancel Erica's sense until they make the LXR great again.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.600
 Instead it.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.600
 Yes.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.680
 Are you actively looking for one?

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.920
 Are you seriously considering getting one?

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.920
 Or are you just sort of like at the moment?

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.920
 No at the moment.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.200
 My desire kind of passed because when I returned it you know I bought the machine drum again

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.400
 and that's keeping me occupied.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.400
 Yeah.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.880
 There's always room for more drum machines.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880
 Absolutely.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880
 Yeah.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.000
 Do you feel better getting that off your chest and sort of eating that crow?

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 Yeah.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 Yeah it's good clarification.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 Good update.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 Yeah.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 See we can admit we're wrong.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 Absolutely.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 Which is every episode.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.280
 Oh yeah sure we're wrong about something.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.720
 We are definitely wrong about something in this first like 20 minutes or whatever we

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.720
 were talking about.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.720
 Yeah.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.720
 Like 100%.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.720
 Yeah.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.720
 And we'll be wrong again.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.720
 The module is called Bard's actually.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.720
 Jesus Christ.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.720
 Jesus Christ.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.400
 So Nick did you have anything before we get into Super booth?

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.800
 Yeah I don't know.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:01.600
 I had metropolis I figured we would touch on and then industrial music electronics I

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.800
 haven't written down as hard as Mark three.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.800
 Yeah I want to hear your take on that stuff.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.040
 Yeah that one definitely the Mark threes.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:14.480
 The bucke I never knew I wanted even though I kind of wanted a bucke tip top audio we should

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.680
 talk about that too.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:19.440
 But yeah the Mark threes.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.800
 So I've had the Lester for a while since you know you got the Lester and then I got mine

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:28.240
 after and have been really liking that but I've been digging into presets a little more

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:33.240
 after the Harlequins and getting that and it was just really had my eye on the piston

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:37.960
 Honda because I love my Mark one one of my favorite oscillators not diminished by the

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.320
 arrival of the Mark three at all even though they're very different beasts.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:48.240
 But yeah that whole setup was more intriguing so I took a leap on a piston from Toman because

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.480
 they were in stock because they went out of stock forever because of a part shortage

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.320
 and shit like that.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.640
 But um the Mark three piston to start off I also got the Kermit not too long ago so those

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.880
 two came to the mix and they're both fucking incredible.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.800
 Some of my favorite modules I've ever purchased period I just think the designs on them are

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:14.080
 fucking like so well thought out like the way the presets work is so simple but so flexible

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.480
 I've never seen it in that way at anything in your rack at all because you have different

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.160
 modes for the presets that you can do like simple shit like default so when you turn

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.440
 on the module goes into preset mode so if you're playing live you don't have to like

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.880
 set each one to preset mode manually and go into it.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.320
 You only get eight presets in the whole system but it's like brilliant the way it works because

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:39.560
 you can just have a CV going in that scans through them like you know scans through them

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.280
 sequentially or morphs through them all you get of it just more for the parameters or

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.800
 more everything that happens on the module.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.240
 When you get the module and you put it in preset mode that locks out all the other controls

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.040
 which some people don't like but I totally see why it's that way you can get out of that

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:59.800
 mode quickly too but you can also just have triggers go in and iterate each one going

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.880
 forward.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:06.960
 He also put in fixes so that the CV when you use multiple passively molted inputs on

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.640
 the preset it doesn't the loading effects like don't fuck with it so it's like it works

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.840
 like really well so for I'm very excited for live use and the cool thing is it would

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.440
 also work with the Harlequins context like I just use one of those outputs to also go

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.520
 in and control everything and then I have three other modules that I kind of preset

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.520
 with.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.080
 So you're talking about just like having one thing as like an offset.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.080
 Yeah.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.080
 Exactly.

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.080
 Yeah.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.320
 Just having an offset in that Harlequins context going in and managing all the CVs on the

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.320
 Mark 3 shit.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.560
 It's something that presets and the fact that that's cool and flexible and like wow

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.440
 Scott designed a preset system that almost anybody would want to use that doesn't use

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:50.040
 the fucking awful select bus shit that's on you know the extra pin on the bus boards.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.640
 We have the Mark 3 piston sounds fucking amazing.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:59.420
 I love it but there are also some things it doesn't have like it doesn't have more discontinuity

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:04.280
 for some reason which is a really good CV controllable effect on the Mark 1 piston which

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.080
 sounds like really fucking good.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:11.800
 It lacks the flaw that the Mark 1 and I think the Mark 2 have where if you send it too much

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.960
 voltage on one side and leak out through the other which I really like and people you

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.880
 know I think he retained that on purpose on the Mark 2 actually.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.880
 Yeah it was on it too.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:26.200
 So much which I use all the time for effect and really like the ability to disrupt that

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.560
 shit.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.920
 But the nice thing is the Mark 3 has the SD card where you can upload the wave edit

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.040
 shit which I haven't tried yet because I'm just trying to get familiar with what's there

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.840
 first because I'm skeptical sometimes of like yeah can I design a wave table that's

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.440
 better than what Scott did I could probably find something that I would like that's maybe

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:48.280
 more mellow in some cases but for the most part it's all kind of covered if you actually

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.440
 like just learn it.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:54.200
 That's how I've the Erica graphic VCO where you can edit I thought I was going to use

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.200
 a shit out of that.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.200
 Yeah.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.120
 I've made like five genuinely different and usable things total.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.600
 Well the most part everything's covered like especially when you got like huge banks of

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.600
 waveforms like that.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.600
 Yeah.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.280
 I also didn't use it as much as I thought.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.480
 This one actually has less waveforms than the Mark 2.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:17.240
 He reduced the number before it was like 2048 number.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.240
 Yep.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.240
 No you're right.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.400
 And some reason that number is burned in my head.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.400
 Yeah.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.400
 2048.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.760
 This one's in 8x8x8 cube like kind of like the Mark 1 is.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:32.680
 So I think it was it seemed like the Mark 3's are like Scott like refining all the shit

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:36.160
 and being like cool I kind of went ham with the Mark 2 and now how can I make these like

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.840
 even more playable.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.040
 Which takes me to the Kermit which is like quad modulators.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.880
 I have a couple of them now Zadar Kermit quad racks.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.800
 Saw Kermit and saw like the setup and the fact that it could use the presets and it had

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:54.400
 envelopes and LFOs and tempo sync Delafos and some other cool shit.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.520
 I was like I've got to try this and like zero grads.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.400
 It's one of my favorite quad modulators ever.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.360
 I think it's easier to use in the Zadar in a way because it's a little more nopped out.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.480
 It's got a lot of combos on it.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.440
 There are different button combinations for everything because you've got on the Kermit

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:15.960
 you've got A, B, C and D. A and B have like full controls for like amplitude, wave shape

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.440
 and then pitch or time or whatever.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.360
 And then C and D just have like one knob for each.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:29.560
 But you can use the hot hot buttons like the channel buttons I guess on each one hot buttons.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.560
 Something totally different.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:36.400
 You can use the channel button on each modulator and then like use the knobs for C and D and

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.880
 like select the other parameters.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:44.320
 So they're all like full function except it may be C and D don't go as high modulation

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.320
 wise.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.520
 They're like slightly different or something.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.520
 But you've got like six banks of like all these other wave tables in there.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.720
 There's a VCO mode for each of them which I haven't played with too much.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:00.720
 But sounds like pretty good and weird and he made it like not stable on purpose apparently.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.720
 I don't know why.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.200
 Just Scott be it Scott probably doesn't want to have too much overlap with the piston I

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.200
 would think.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.640
 Pretty well versed in the pistons.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.920
 I had two Mark twos for a long time.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.920
 You know what I mean?

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.920
 I love them.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:16.720
 And I just haven't had the chance to jump to the Mark 3s and you telling me you got the

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.080
 Kermit Mark 3 recently.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.960
 I was like what is that all about?

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.040
 It's one thing that like I always had enough modulation in my rack.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.440
 So I never really got into the Kermit from Scott.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.160
 And I was like let's see what this is all about.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:36.560
 And I watched a few demos like this is like almost like a piston junior in some ways.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.560
 You know what I mean?

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.360
 I was like there seems to be a lot of spill over there.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.640
 And I could definitely imagine how it goes really well with the pistons.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:48.320
 It's just modulated wave table madness there.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.040
 It's got like a global tap tempo with an input too.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:56.520
 Which means like the thing I love is like I love the four milliseconds peg is clocked

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.960
 modulation is like you know it's fucking techno.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.800
 It sounds great to have varied clock modulation.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.080
 And this is the only one that will go to like 30 seconds clock divisions.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:11.560
 I find I'm using C and D often to modulate A and B because of the reduced controls because

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.560
 it's easy.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.600
 You just like literally hold down the knob and then hold the other one and it like modulates

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.600
 it.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.760
 So there are lots of like shortcuts you have to remember.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:24.080
 That's maybe a con but I think it's designed well enough that it's like not a pain in the

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.080
 ass.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:31.520
 It's like easier to use than the Zadar for me like to be able to like edit a fucking wave.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.240
 So when you make those sort of combinations and is it do you then have a visual cue as

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.720
 to what you've done?

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.720
 That's the one thing.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:41.400
 So you can see the waveform only when you're changing the wave shape mode.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:46.640
 It would be cool if you let you set as default which screen you wanted to go on.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.320
 But it's nice how much information he packs into these little screens and how well it

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.320
 actually works.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:56.120
 It's not like I had that hair mod from Squarp and that was way too fucking small.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.120
 Maybe the same size but you were trying to run like a sequencer from that fucking thing.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.000
 Like including editing and that was a nightmare.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.520
 So we did a great job with that.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:10.280
 Oh another cool feature you can have it use the code of the module as a modulator like

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.800
 the bucla oscillator used to be able to do.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:18.640
 So he's like oh you can just use my graphical representation of the actual module firmware

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.640
 to modulate things which is just like a nice touch.

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.000
 I haven't even tried it yet but I saw that and I was like oh code scan what the fuck's

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 that?

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.880
 So I'll use the code as a modulator because it's it's such a clear like reference to

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:34.920
 bucla but I've got two other things about the piston Honda too.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.100
 People will be able to piece this together but um the FM you get two fucking piston

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.100
 Hondas in one.

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:45.120
 That's like maybe the first thing off the map is you actually get two with external inputs

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.560
 you can do stereo processing with it which you could never do with the mark one of the

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.560
 mark two.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:54.800
 It's like double so for the price it's like really fucking good.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.360
 The FM between the two is through zero and it sounds ridiculous.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.840
 I've gotten shit from that which is like okay.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:08.040
 It almost gets that kind of sound where it's so detailed it almost sounds like a reverb

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:15.160
 kind of but it's not it's just really it doesn't shit itself like even an analog oscillator

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:20.160
 would against a piston mark one because it's eight sixteen bit so that helps but um it

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.800
 just sounds like really nice in that regard and I didn't even realize at first like you

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:28.680
 get two piston Hondas in one basically with some routing between them.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.640
 So that's super like flexible and just to set up all three of those I have like Kermit

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:38.040
 above piston and ellaster and just they just sound great as a group I'm getting a lot of

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.040
 mileage out of it.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:44.800
 That's not just maybe what people generalize harvest manner industrial music electronics

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800
 is sounding like.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.160
 You can get all sorts of shit out of it.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.240
 So one of the things I used to do when I had two mark two pistons was have one in LFO

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.120
 mode to modulate the other in audio mode.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:00.920
 You're saying this is two pistons and one can you have the second oscillator in LFO

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.920
 mode?

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.160
 No I don't think you can't well it's kind of locked double check I think it topped out

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:11.760
 at like 200 Hertz or something like that on the low end if you I don't know I can't

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.800
 answer that question very well right now because I have the Kermit and I always use

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.800
 that as LFO.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.800
 Gotcha.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.160
 I don't remember it being able to go.

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.200
 The mark two it had like a button you know I mean we're just taking LFO mode.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.200
 Yeah.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.720
 And I loved using it as an LFO to modulate the other piston.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:33.880
 You know it was really cool but I totally forgot I haven't even tried that yet.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.880
 It's an LFO.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.040
 You really got me wanting a piston mark three now.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040
 Yeah.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:43.200
 Mark three is like it's been gold so far I really like how it sounds.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.960
 It's funny because now you really have me wanting a Kermit.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.880
 Yeah that sounds amazing.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:53.640
 Kermit is that was I really slept on that module until like I look at it.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:54.640
 I slept on all the Kermit.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:59.240
 What the fuck this is like an awesome quad modulator with tempo sync and you've got like

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:03.160
 custom waveforms all these different modes like envelope modes too.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:07.360
 Well say I had the Kermit mark one for a minute but I also had the double and or mark one

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.520
 at the time and I was like oh yeah.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.520
 I don't need this Kermit.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.560
 You know like I got this andor and it's got all this way you know waveforms I can use

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:19.040
 for modulation and things like that so I got rid of it but and I just kind of fell off

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:25.120
 track with the mark two and the mark three iterations of it but sounds like it's come

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.120
 a long way.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.600
 Yeah it definitely has.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:31.240
 They just work super well together too.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.240
 Just great designs.

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.240
 I don't know.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.840
 You fucking nailed it.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.840
 I love it.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.760
 I can't wait to try and use the presets a little more.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.120
 I've like checked it to see if it works but I haven't like built the live set with it

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.720
 yet but I think it'll be pretty straightforward.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.480
 We'll see.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.480
 Yeah.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.360
 I've done a lot of audio processing with it at all.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.360
 Yes.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.360
 External inputs.

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.360
 Mark two's.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:58.480
 16 bit external inputs have been a lot more useful for me than the 8 bit on the mark one

00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.480
 I'll say.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.840
 I still love the sound of the mark one.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:05.800
 I've been using three pistons for sure but the external input is way nicer with the

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.800
 extra resolution.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.800
 It just sounds good.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.800
 Does it have any controls?

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.560
 On the mark two's you used to have the gain control.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.560
 Yeah.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.400
 It's frequency turns into gain.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.400
 Okay.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:23.400
 Obviously the wave cable change is there's a change where you can make it, oh yeah you

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.920
 can make it sound more like a mark one piston.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.920
 Okay.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.080
 There's like a setting that'll degrade a bit.

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:33.840
 Where apparently but I think even in 16 bit mode it's really hard to tell the difference

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.840
 for me.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:38.680
 I'll put up some of those classic banks that the piston mark one has and it's like wow

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.480
 that's I don't know it sounds exactly the same in some ways.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.480
 Cool.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.000
 But the FM way clearer.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.240
 Yeah no more discontinuity.

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:51.920
 There's something I kind of liked on the mark one too about how you switched the ROMs

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.040
 even though it was a hacked like hold the button and show those windows it kind of stuck

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.320
 because you couldn't get to it if you had CV going in.

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.440
 It was just like yeah luck of the draw.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:07.080
 But there's something kind of odd about having the third slider select so much possibly on

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.080
 the module itself.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.360
 Like you don't want to touch that it's more drastic.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:15.240
 It's weird it's like least drastic change on XY is a little more because it's scanning

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:20.640
 through the variance of X and other ones like whole ROMs kind of.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.400
 And how many are there per slider?

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.080
 Just eight and eight.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.080
 Okay.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.920
 Strange touches though like even when you're on the screen it's always like one one two

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:34.240
 two like Scott puts like weird stuff in there when you select through it all.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.240
 It's like you're not scanning through one through eight.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:41.000
 Oh and another nice thing is um I love this do the way the wave tables are designed.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.960
 It always ends on the waveform it starts off at even though it's not symmetrical you

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:52.280
 can always get to like I know if it starts sign you can always get exactly to that sound.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:55.560
 So you can like it's musically very nice because you can get to the point you want to

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:59.160
 and then scan through it the other way but it's like this point of return that you know

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.160
 about.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:03.960
 Oh yeah and then fucking tuning um the way it does it it's always quantized but there's

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.520
 like some slew between the values.

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:12.080
 I love it shows the note value on the piston of what it's playing.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:16.200
 So I'm able to like go to my sequencer and knock it up and octave and see the like D1

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.760
 went to D2 or something like that.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.060
 It's just really nice you know like oh yeah that's exactly in tune and it's really easy

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.400
 to get it back in tune.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.040
 Huge improvement I wish every oscillator had a similar model.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.840
 It's fucking yeah it's just really refined um even though I like the Mark 1's a lot which

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.680
 we were talking about before the Mark 1's are no slouch.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.160
 This has made me look more for like older Mark 1 modules too.

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.640
 I'd love that time so far.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:45.600
 Yeah I can do it exactly.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.920
 I always miss my Mark 1 times far too.

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.480
 I've owned one three different times.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.760
 I like because I'll go you know I'll spend a lot of time with it.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.480
 I'll do a shit ton of recording with it and I'll be like okay I got everything I need

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.920
 to get out of a Mark 1 for a time far right now.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.440
 I don't need this right now and then I sell it and then I'm like okay the month later

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.120
 I'm like fuck the third time though that's ridiculous.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.400
 Yeah by that point you should have figured it out that you want one and you should just

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.400
 keep it.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:15.000
 Yeah the first two it's like okay that we get it but like the third one that's that's

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 entirely on you.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.520
 You got a lot of mileage out of that.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.440
 I remember you back in the day.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.920
 That was probably my favorite mod.

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:27.280
 There was point time where I had to like sell most of my modular stuff and all I kept was

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:33.280
 a dope for beauty case that had my time Safari Mark 1 in there with the sound of thunder

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.280
 expansion and a waggle bug.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.720
 And that kept me fucking happy for a while.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:42.600
 I got so much mileage just out of those two modules you know me and just running external

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:48.080
 sound through the Safari, glitching it up you know I mean like that was my makeshift

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:52.240
 like granular processor box you know what I mean before things like clouds and things

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:56.920
 like that existed like I love the time Safari.

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:04.280
 I've enjoyed the Mark 2 but I feel like the Mark 1 just had a very distinct sound, very

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:06.160
 distinct distortion that I could get out of it.

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.560
 Very interesting noises like there was times where I wouldn't even route anything through

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:14.000
 it I would feedback patch it and just find interesting patches using you know the sound

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.280
 of thunder expanders to make interesting just noise that I would record you know what I

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:25.120
 mean and unshape and sculpt but yeah I love that module and it's like impossible to find

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:30.600
 you know and also there was a lot of variance between them you know I mean like every Mark

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:36.040
 1 time Safari did not sound like the next you know I mean some of them have very distinct

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:41.080
 sound some of them are noisier than others you know I mean things like that so and I

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:47.800
 think there were some minor changes with like Ninja updated firmware between them too so

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:54.480
 very unique module you know that was all based off of the fucking SK1 right you know

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:59.920
 so probably hard to even make these days you know I mean like I don't know if it used

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:04.720
 like actual chips from the SK1 or if it was just inspired by I forget I know Scott explained

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.320
 it to me back in the day but I'll be damned if I remember now but if you if you need

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:15.600
 you can have my SK1 I was gonna say I have one too send a Scott yeah that'll be 10,000

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:19.680
 dollars and that's what the sound of thunder like expander was supposed to replicate with

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:25.480
 certain bends that Scott knew because Scott was well versed with the SK1 to that for a

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:29.240
 fact I think before he started making harvest man modules I think that's what he was doing

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:35.280
 for people was circumventing SK1's yeah there's a million bends on it yeah because that's

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:43.480
 the one I have I was supposed to do the table beast mod for someone else and then only now

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:50.000
 might remember I agree to do that that's why you have the SK1 that's why I have it yeah

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.520
 yeah but yeah I love that module I miss it dearly if I yeah I would scoop one up in a

00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:00.600
 heartbait if I saw one again too I don't know if I would pay like ridiculous price

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:06.560
 gouging prices for it but like a fair price I'd be like yeah I would like that if even

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:11.480
 if I don't feel like I need to use it for recording at this point in time I would just

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:17.680
 like to have one for nostalgic sake you know I mean yeah you're your your eyes are twinkling

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:21.560
 yeah like this thing about like the nostalgia that you're going through right now it made

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.800
 it onto a lot of different recorded material yeah yeah a lot of Prometheus burning stuff

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:31.840
 I think even some early to shovel stuff definitely used it live a lot for Prometheus burning

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:38.840
 towards the end there yeah it was just a great module that was one of the modules that got

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:45.880
 me into modular yeah you know I mean well if any of our listeners out there have one I

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:51.040
 want to send it to Greg and Nick we could just share it we'll do a time Safari time share

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:58.840
 mint it super booth stuff the grand booth wait what did we call it at the show we soup

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:04.400
 and buns super yeah we call it I know you made a sticky or something you made a note

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:12.440
 because we were cracking the fuck up at the time new from Panera bread this is soup and

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:19.440
 buns with bungalows or weird little tiny cabins or shallays like I don't know what

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:26.320
 the where so that looks like a certain city super booth yeah or like a like a like a

00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:34.880
 park vibe what else can I really so I think it's probably unanimous amongst this which

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:40.280
 which announced and stole the show I don't even have a joke I was going to do a bait and

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:47.720
 switch here but like not the the Erica since Perkins HD one right yeah that only thing

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:54.120
 that I could remember actually I have it at the top here and it basically there's no note

00:57:54.120 --> 00:58:00.000
 be beside it because it is like the very obvious the biggest thing yeah like everything else

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.400
 I had to like take notes for because I might not remember and I took some news for because

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:10.040
 there's a lot to say about it it was definitely on the socials the most like people who went

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:15.560
 there and like famously people it was always the thing they pointed out hmm everyone had

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:20.520
 to have a go with the Perkins I'm probably saying that completely wrong but I feel like

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:24.960
 I heard someone say Perkins or Perkins I'm just gonna refer to it as like Perkins like

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:32.440
 the restaurant oh or like Perkins like the from Star Wars yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:38.240
 those pork ins that was yeah I'm gonna think about the restaurant makes me think a secret

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:45.240
 in gravy pork pork ins as a Perkins that was a that is a missed cross promotional

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:51.480
 opportunity wow well we'll hit up the Perkins and Lucas arts after that's a new Star Wars

00:58:51.480 --> 00:59:02.640
 scramble Perkins stay on target to your stomach but you know get the fuck out yeah that was

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:10.280
 nice thing about being the editor I can just take that out I thought you dare yeah that's

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:14.680
 the quality nerd shit people have grown to love and expect it's right it's right it's

00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:20.920
 right here this makes dumpster up this but however you pronounce it I believe I saw in

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:28.520
 the notes that it's Baltic for thunder oh oh yeah yeah thunder kind of theme so Eric since

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:37.120
 bringing the thunder oh so every sound demo I heard mmm fucking killed I loved every like

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:45.480
 I was that sounds amazing mmm real oh okay you what didn't you like the Heinbach one the

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:51.880
 Heinbach one didn't really do it for me that was the first one that came out and I was

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:55.400
 like super excited to see this thing in action and I watched that and I was just like kind

00:59:55.400 --> 01:00:00.840
 of like the codec one the blush response one great blush was great I was a few random

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.600
 ones from just random people that were actually pretty good you know just fit my brain filtered

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.960
 out some of the bad ones because the ones that I really enjoyed were like I was bad but

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.920
 it wasn't the first one that I wanted to hear you know I mean like I'm not a huge fan

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.880
 of like his production to start with sure and I feel like this machine belongs in hands

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:20.120
 of someone a little more aggressive yeah you know I mean and he was I kind of go and gentle

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:25.120
 with it and made like kind of a boring repetitive patch honestly I think I'm completely

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:29.040
 forgot about it yeah I was really focusing on the ones that I really enjoyed which were

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:35.240
 more recent and some of them were from super booth mm-hmm and that's yeah and I was so

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:42.200
 there's a lot it seems there's a lot of limitations and I think there is the sort of 800 pound

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:47.800
 elephant in the room of it being astronomically expensive how much was it again it's too grand

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:56.680
 that's not that's the projection right and for what is on it I agree it seemed and but

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.520
 we talked about the we sort of talk about this offline and I think we bring it up now

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.480
 is like yes all of all of those things are true but generally things are more expensive

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:09.520
 right now and inflation is happening and part scarcity and all of these things and it's

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:14.360
 probably not going to be mass produced in a way that you know like they're gonna have

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.040
 to make a profit on each of these ones and it's gonna probably take a long time to make

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:24.680
 like I'm not trying to justify boutique pricing but that I'm wondering how much of it is not

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.280
 boutique pricing and simply this is just how much it's gonna cost and if we want to keep

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.920
 doing this they're gonna have to charge that I kind of yeah I take back what I said I think

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:37.800
 after I thought about it a little the lack of bio lack of CV the fact that it's totally

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:43.360
 digital is it just like a chip in there with some outputs filters or analogs oh the filters

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.760
 are in the master effects like I think that's a I think it's an analog BBD chip I could

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:55.320
 be wrong here I know the compressor in the saturation circuit I think our analog I think

01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:02.200
 if I remember right now I take my but the drum voices are definitely digitally I yeah

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.320
 I remember I had a lot of sticker shock to when I first read that for what it is you know

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:12.840
 I mean but I wasn't surprised because as much as I like I recastened stuff I feel like

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:17.600
 the prices have been a little high lately especially when it comes with their standalone

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:25.000
 type devices centrix is my number one go to to reflect that like I don't think that thing

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.600
 is a machine that is worth near four thousand dollars oh you don't understand pricing at all

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.120
 I do gather it's the custom case it's something that all the R&D they put into the pin shit

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:41.220
 so this kind of falls in line there with like the the higher pricing of you know their

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:50.600
 standalone devices if this machine was semi modular I would be able to shake some of that

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.840
 sticker show yeah you know but it has not right which is strange because Erica since I think

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:03.480
 is primarily known for being a modular manufacturer overall I feel like it just came out of left

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:09.120
 field you know what I mean like I don't think anyone was expecting a big hunk and drum machine

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:15.360
 like that to be announced sampling it all playback samples no sampling another minus

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:21.980
 you're trying to yeah yeah at least to me like I was like we were talking about offline I

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:28.940
 feel like I feel like this machine kind of like how you were saying like you know after

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:32.900
 two years quarantine people were coming up with ideas one of the things that was blowing

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:42.140
 up over the last two years was the Pulsar 23 by Soma yeah and I feel like this was probably

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:49.420
 conceived shortly after Erica witnessed the success of the Pulsar and thought okay how

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:55.020
 can we tap into this market clearly there's a lot of demand for this type of machine and

01:03:55.020 --> 01:04:00.100
 they spent the last two years of quarantine coming up with their own contender to throw

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:06.820
 in the ring and like even though it's clearly a very different machine than the Pulsar I

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:13.820
 think there's a lot of fucking similarities that I would I made notes to point out here

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:21.220
 some of them being both machines have four voices only both machines are big metal hands-on

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:30.660
 devices they are both totally menu less they both feature an onboard BBD slash delay circuit

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:37.260
 and an onboard distortion slash like compression circuit and they both have a very like aggressive

01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:45.740
 hard industrial vibe and they both cost roughly around two grand so it seems like it's made

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:55.340
 to compete with it you know I mean yeah whereas like where they defer is the Pulsar has like

01:04:55.340 --> 01:05:03.580
 limitless modulation you know like anything can be hit with CV or MIDI or a body contact

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:12.300
 or recorded on the sequencer you know like memory recording of parameters like it's so

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.940
 much modulation possibilities on the Pulsar that I found it very overwhelming you know

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:22.700
 I mean like it's limitless whereas looked like Erica kind of was like okay that's where we're

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:28.260
 going to stand out and be different we're not going to have that much you know ability

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:34.540
 to modulate everything we're not going to have any CV at all things can be I think hit

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:41.140
 with MIDI it said it has vast MIDI capabilities but as far as modulation goes it seems to

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:47.220
 be strictly only parameter recording on the sequencer or it has an LFO which it says in

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:53.660
 description can be mapped to everything but even still like I believe it's a single LFO

01:05:53.660 --> 01:06:00.660
 oh wow oh holy shit I think it's hard to tell looking at it it's not even like a LFO per

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:09.180
 channel no oh that's the so in the early prototype leaks there was pictures showing a joystick

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:14.700
 on the right hand corner which in my opinion would have been an awesome addition but that's

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:22.300
 been replaced with like the modulation speed wheel now for the I take it the LFO so yeah

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:29.220
 the modulation capability seemed pretty limited and I don't know why they couldn't do both

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:34.820
 have the joystick and the modulation I think that would have been really cool you know I

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:39.580
 mean it was a nice looking joystick right off of like the Cintrex device but maybe it

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:45.180
 keeps cost down they've removed it I don't know but so but I mean sonically like did

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:50.420
 you think it was a capable machine yes cuz that's the thing I kept coming back to was

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:55.460
 like everything you said everything yeah I'm 100% agree but there was a part of the kept

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:59.940
 coming back and going like damn but it sounds good like I'd like the way that it sounded

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:05.620
 yeah it sounds good but I think I think it would be risky for me because I think I would

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:09.220
 get bored with him like that was one of the things that was cool about the Paul Sores like

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:14.380
 yes there's only four voices they sound cool on their own but you can do a lot of interesting

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:20.980
 sound design with the Paul Sore with this you're lacking a lot of sound design functionality

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:26.380
 yes there's a couple on board effects and yes each channel does have its own send return

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:32.460
 individual out for routing it through external effects which is cool it is cool but you're

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:36.220
 still gonna be very limited with like what you can do with just four voices you know and

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:45.540
 how you shape that and I don't see any information anywhere explaining what these voices can do

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:50.900
 it says there's three modes for each voice like that's it's kind of cool that each voice

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:55.140
 isn't locked into a certain you don't have a BD you know the snare exactly yeah yeah so

01:07:55.140 --> 01:08:00.580
 that's cool but like what are these three modes I don't fucking know it might only be

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:06.180
 kick mode snare mode hat mode right yeah I mean so you're working within three variations

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:13.580
 of that or are each of these engine modes like a whole plethora of choices that you can

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:19.020
 shape through like each one had a tables or samples or whatever you know or if each one

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:23.700
 had different sets of three like this one actually some like you know like they're not

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:31.860
 three different hat modes yeah something like that yeah so it's really unclear and it seems

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:39.220
 possibly a little too limited for my taste that's fair especially for the price yeah yeah

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:44.060
 we'll see I don't know I'm I definitely have my eye on it I'm curious about it I want to

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:51.460
 see more demos of it the machine itself looks fucking gorgeous you know yeah yeah and the

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:56.500
 fact that there's no menu like that's really appealing to me yeah like a parameter locks

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:01.220
 and other stuff in there without that it's pretty cool yeah I that's one thing I hate about

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:06.900
 drum machines is having a menu dive into things you know I mean yeah yeah even the the

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:13.620
 Roland's like I kind of like the TR8 more than the TR8s agreed because the TR8s is so

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:19.700
 dependent on jumping through that tiny shitty little menu yeah I mean whereas like the TR8

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:25.700
 kind of lacked that you could just jump in make a rhythm you know yeah so those seem

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:34.180
 really good hands-on quick to you know break out a beat on but I don't know like the longevity

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:39.780
 of it you know I mean like what I get sick of that sound quickly is the right right right

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:44.020
 and can you deviate from that really aggressive sound that it has like you know are you going

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:47.940
 to be making IDM stuff on this are you going to be making techno on this are you just going

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:52.580
 to be making like industrial like seems like you might be kind of locked into a specific

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:58.020
 sound with it right right hard to break out of which might be what they wanted you know

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:04.100
 just something that was aiming at a very specific target and yeah I mean even the list

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:09.940
 of people that we just referenced for demoing it true but if you listen to any of those demos

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:15.300
 blindfolded would you have been able to tell probably not anyone's you know demoed with

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:19.220
 that I was talking that up to like this being a relatively new machine that you know I don't

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:23.060
 know how long they had to spend with it before they were doing these demos but you're right

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:28.020
 if it ends up being like the next round of demos all still sound the same it might just be that's

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:31.300
 what it sounds like great that was kind of the just I was getting like the only one that was

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:35.540
 different was the Heimbach one which I didn't like but at the same time I still was like okay at least

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:40.820
 that demo stood out a little bit I can remember that showed you something rain yeah more so than

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.900
 all that rest of them because they all had a very similar vibe and everyone was just making like

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:51.700
 you know basically four to the floor industrial techno on it which sounded very close to the

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:58.980
 next demo of it yeah so I don't know I still go back to I like that sound oh yeah there was a

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:02.820
 part of me I was like oh sounds really good but yeah you're right as far as like paying that much

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:07.700
 money to sound like everyone else who has one that's not exciting yeah because it's at the point

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:12.420
 where you could buy another sequence or in some draw modules and maybe have a lot more flexibility

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:19.060
 not pay as much or maybe equivalent that's hard choice right yeah and on the opposite side of

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:24.180
 the spectrum for that same amount of money you get the Paulsar yeah which every demo of the Paulsar

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:31.860
 sounds nothing like if they're using the machine you know in a capable way and they're utilizing

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:37.620
 the CV and things like that like you know that is a highly versatile four voice the machine you know

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:45.620
 yeah so I don't know I'm curious to see when this is actually going to come out I think it's supposed

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:49.860
 to come out before the end of the year right if I recall that's what that's what I remember I

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:54.500
 remember them saying something about that but like I don't know how much that can be trusted at this

01:11:54.500 --> 01:12:01.940
 point and all of the supply issues so yeah I mean for that type of money it's like I think I'll

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:05.940
 stick with my machine drum from now you know what I mean yeah but it would be nice to have something

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:11.460
 next to my machine drum that adds a little bit of a different approach yeah but this is not a

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:18.020
 casual purchase exactly yeah like so it's I'm definitely gonna wait and see you know for more

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:23.380
 demos and see if I like them but I'm definitely gonna be keeping my eye on it I think you're

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:28.420
 you're seemed kind of sold immediately so you think you're gonna be pre-ordering or I don't know

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:33.540
 what a pre-order yeah because that's a lot of money right that's really the only thing I'm

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:41.060
 bulking at is like can I justify that cost for what I'm gonna get out of it and right now it

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:47.140
 seems like the answer is yes but actually yeah I mean I don't I don't know if I'm ready to pre-order

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:51.940
 anything right now but I don't know if I'm then going to become oh crap I want this and now it's

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:56.580
 impossible to get yeah there's definitely that risk I think but that's not a great reason to do

01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:01.060
 something I'm not a fear of missing out I mean the policy was like that and that was before part

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:06.340
 shortage right I mean like it took months and months to be I was like always interested in the

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:11.300
 Paulsar but I was more like oh that'd be cool if someone I had one like that was my level of

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:16.820
 interest where this I was like this seemed really just resonated with you yeah yeah it really hit me

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:20.980
 like I can get a lot of use out of this especially if you have lots of processing that you can

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:25.300
 route through those and that could be it but it all depends on how does it sound you know yeah

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:32.340
 like like you said was it gonna last in the long run so our manual for it yet and see one

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:37.780
 I see one either on the website was pretty fucking vague about stuff um they're pretty good with

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:44.660
 manuals I mean they've they've had manuals out before modules came out so um maybe as it is it gets

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:50.100
 closer and they nail down what everything does I'm extra curious about the sequencer I'm wondering

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:55.540
 if like there's a mode because it's four lanes you know I mean I'm wondering if you can have all

01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:00.740
 four lanes while you're editing a voice be dedicated to that voice for that moment so you have like

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:06.340
 64 steps at your disposal you know instead of like 16 that would be nice yeah then you hit a button

01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:09.700
 and then you're on the next voice and you have 64 step you know I mean like yeah let me curious

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:15.780
 if they're doing anything like that um especially having 64 steps all right there in front of you

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:19.620
 that's what I'm saying that would be really nice like I don't even know if that's possible I don't

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:25.380
 know if it's you know you only get the four lanes and each lane is dedicated to each voice that

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:30.180
 you know at a time or well maybe it wasn't possible but you just put them idea in their head and

01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:35.940
 food for thawl yeah that's the great feature I I would like to see that for sure that would be

01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:40.500
 awesome yeah the sequencer layout and the keys on it reminds me very much of their drum sequencer

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:46.020
 module yeah I'm hoping there's a lot of functionality from that module in this thing and it seems like

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:51.300
 there is it looks like there's like some looks like you can do some time fuckery and some ratcheting

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:56.820
 and things of that nature probably probability if I recall there's in there so yeah I think so

01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:02.420
 since it seemed like a pretty powerful sequencer just it would just be extra nice to be able to

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:06.180
 have 64 steps you're supposed to at a time you absolutely agree yeah um

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:12.740
 because they're they're already there you know what I mean it's I mean what the what you just

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:18.900
 described makes sense so hopefully they're listening and or already did it but yeah a lot

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:24.820
 a lot of questions how does the compressor sound how does the bbd sound how tight can it go

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:30.820
 right into getting the car plus strong type territory how long can it go you know who knows

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:38.740
 questions questions questions that need answers it's still the show yeah super booth but yeah

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:50.020
 little steal our hearts um so yeah I agree I think that was the

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:56.980
 I hadn't told above everything else uh well what else was that super booth godfather

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:04.020
 that caught my attention but enjoy electronics it is yes Nathan godfather also caught my eye

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:08.820
 great video yeah as I said before we even get into what it is let we have to give

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:16.980
 mention to that video yeah that was stellar probably the best module uh slash gear

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:23.700
 demo video I've ever seen I don't know how well not demo video but like an ounce or it was a teaser

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:27.860
 it was a teaser I'm trying to think of what even the second best one was I would say my

01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:34.820
 second favorite probably the old school um electron ones with um Hector Hector oh yeah those

01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:42.740
 those were cool yeah I like those um I'm this Hector but but this I mean you want to

01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:46.660
 describe what happens in it I mean it's just like a playoff the godfather you know I mean

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:52.900
 there's some shady looking Italian gentlemen and fine dress suits in a gorgeous car yeah which

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.980
 I forget the name of uh john luke did tell me what the hell that thing was called the

01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:04.020
 not forget it was a Fiat something it's a classic car classic Fiat but yeah pristine

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:09.620
 conditional black very nice looking uh john luke made sure to tell me that uh I should never

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:15.700
 consider even trying to get in one he said I'm way too tall he was like you'd be sticking out the

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:21.620
 roof I was like oh okay um yeah pretty pretty cool little car and they're just you know walking

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:26.740
 around with a briefcase you know it's looking like some mobster type shit and then they go to

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:32.820
 a capo of some sort uh you know a crime boss looking dude sitting at a table and they pop open

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:38.580
 the briefcase and there is the godfather effects processing unit and uh it's just well done you

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:45.940
 know it's cute yeah um I like to see you know a little bit of imagination like that with a product

01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:51.140
 announcement you know yeah yeah definitely I totally agreed and like once I saw the demos of

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:56.820
 it later I was like oh shit that's that one like it did do a good job of sort of like putting

01:17:56.820 --> 01:18:02.260
 it to forefront of my of my brain sure I would agree with that so what does it I actually don't

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:06.740
 know at all what it does because while I saw the teaser I didn't look at it beyond that

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:15.140
 enlightenment so it is a four channel uh processor audio processor um the left side is uh saturation

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:21.220
 double pulse delay reverb filter and the right side is reverb delay

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:28.260
 uh LFO and compressor uh and it looks like there's some sort of routing between all of these

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:33.860
 different channels double pulse delay like a gate delay I think it's I think it's kind of like a

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:40.100
 more evolved delay circuit of what is featured on their reminder oh okay okay I could do some

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:47.700
 crazy shit um I'm willing to bet that it there's not too much spillover like you know I mean I

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:54.100
 don't realize that was the same same company yet okay that was their first big hit um and now

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:59.220
 they're following up with this you almost got a reminder I had one for a while um and I liked it

01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:05.460
 um but I just didn't have this space you know I mean like for outboard processing at that time

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:10.500
 I'm kind of now that I have more space because I have a new house I'm considering going like you

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:15.540
 know a little bit more of the outboard processing again so this definitely caught my eye as well

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:20.580
 you know so far I'm like okay that could be cool could definitely route like the machine

01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:25.380
 drum through this you know I mean things like that is the same size yeah yeah looks like kind of

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:31.300
 like a similar form factors and it sounded good like all the demos that they were they were showing

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:35.620
 uh in versatile they there's a couple of different influencers and youtubers coming up and like

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:41.220
 asking for demos um and it's telling there was a for like a real variety of different uh stuff

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:46.900
 it could do yeah I I hope it's less menu divey that was one thing I didn't like about reminder like

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:53.460
 it was very versatile too um like it had like some hidden features like on board reverbs and

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:58.900
 things like that and you could change different things within there there's a little like I don't

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:02.100
 want to say it was super menu divey but like there was a lot of functionality that was like

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:06.980
 you couldn't just twist the knob and get it you know I mean like when it did seem like godfather

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:12.660
 did have a screen and had a lot of stuff yeah yeah and and I didn't I didn't obviously catch

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:16.740
 everything it did it just seemed like it had a lot of different modes there's a lot of different

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:21.460
 things that you were doing on the screen um so I don't know if that's something to be a little

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:24.980
 concerned about there's a lot more knobs than on the reminder that's for sure oh that's good

01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:30.500
 I'm glancing at it now there's at least there's like 30 some knobs on this that's a lot more

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:36.980
 surface buttons and knobs right right so you're not doing everything from a parameter value knob

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:47.860
 combination yeah it's uh apparently 60 hp and can be racked if you want it to be so I guess they

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:53.780
 built this with modular in mind which is kind of cool um they actually had it in one of those

01:20:53.780 --> 01:21:01.300
 three tier mooks synths stands for the demos hmm was there ever a price mentioned I'm looking

01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:06.740
 for that now I am a possible release date but I didn't I kept looking for the price and I couldn't

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:10.820
 find it anywhere I'm looking at this article and even the person who wrote this article says I didn't

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:16.820
 catch a price but they are going to be open for pre-orders in a couple months so I guess this is

01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:22.900
 a 2022 release I don't think this is something that's going to be out tomorrow um was the reminder

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:29.220
 your rack or was that destiny okay it was pure desktop and it was pretty long if I recall um I

01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:34.260
 think that would have been longer than like your standard rack but it was a nice box you know yeah

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:40.020
 it's great I wanted one just halfway because the box because it looked nice to use and I figured

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:44.900
 if they were gonna bother with something like that it would be worth it yeah I'm glad to see them

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:52.180
 you know coming out with more stuff because like the reminder was pretty successful from you know

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:57.380
 what I gathered looking at like the Kickstarter and stuff you know I mean like um so that was a

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:03.300
 while ago yeah it took them a while to roll them out to something like that like the reminder I

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:09.060
 think was like around four or five hundred bucks yeah I would bet something like this is probably like

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:16.260
 $6.99 that's what I was just guessing like $600 something yeah it feels like I'm shifting a lot

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:22.260
 of my processing back in the box lately like from audio wise like I use the effects aids and I don't

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:27.940
 count like beads or some other stuff like that but um just like the standards I would spin using

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:32.900
 the shit out of my UAD stuff and eat Apollo too because it's sometimes I forget it's there and

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:37.060
 then I realized that it sounds fucking great I don't need much CV control and the recall is kind

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:44.020
 of worth it but yeah just been shifting that way a little more funny considering like we were all

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:50.020
 hyped on stereo for a minute or at least I was but no I'm not so much anymore no yeah I still kind of

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:57.300
 am um doesn't surprise me yeah I don't know why exactly because it makes everything more of a pain

01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:04.980
 in each other but um it's useful sometimes yeah I mean obviously I just I don't know I like to do

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:12.900
 a lot with space you know yeah I feel like you know you achieve that with weird stereo field

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:16.980
 shit you know I mean like no matter how much you pan a mono signal it's still going to be a mono

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:22.660
 signal you know I mean it's like I don't know it's hard to create it's hard to make sounds

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:28.740
 wrap around your fucking face yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm on but oh absolutely yeah you need something

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:36.180
 or at least we do but yeah the effects aids I still use and modulate the show but I still have

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:41.460
 yet to get one and I need to that so below is my fucking line yeah considering how much I can do

01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:46.340
 like even if I don't like I don't need reverb in this I can use something else there's been

01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:51.700
 some specific type of effects I wished I had in modulate lately and I would like dig around

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:59.220
 on modular grid trying to find it and oh only one thing pops up yeah okay it's like yeah yeah

01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:04.660
 anything you can dream up generally he'll probably build in the things it's worth it absolutely so

01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:13.620
 wait super birth that so that was sorry I have um and a couple other things on my list um one was

01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:19.940
 ritual electronics they have a bunch of new things um I I think I just like them there's just

01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:25.220
 something about like I think I totally miss this like the stuff that like new one you stuff yeah

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:28.660
 new one you stuff and um I think I don't know I just generally feel like I'm like on the same

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:35.700
 page with them like they're the only like outwardly a cab manufacturer yes yes so they've got that

01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:41.620
 going for exactly those are pretty fucking great absolutely and everything is like and listen to

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:45.940
 how noisy this is and like it's the noise that I like and I'm just like oh man I kind of want

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:50.260
 to hang out with you guys yeah um so I might be standing for them a little bit um just because

01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:54.900
 I I must be drawn like I don't remember what these guys make like french dudes they make the

01:24:54.900 --> 01:25:00.580
 meosma they make their this shit's always black with like gold accents they make that meosma

01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:05.620
 distortion yeah we have the one you guillotine modules I think we talked about this yeah we did

01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:11.380
 talk about guillotine and they make a couple of like pedal interfaces yeah um and they also make

01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:17.860
 things that they announced at super booth what do we got such as um they have something that's

01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:24.340
 just um a little um one you noise generator for pink white and his which is a high pass on white

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:29.700
 and rumble which is a little pass on pink outputs and it's probably the least interesting thing

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:34.100
 that they're making but like I'll probably end up grabbing one because it's a tiny little noise

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:39.540
 generator um but what is interesting is the I'm going to butcher this fucking name the ruse

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:44.580
 cell mall oh yeah it's like it's not a french to me oh it's french shit you sold me on it

01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:53.460
 Trebiel um it is an eight it is an eight stage shift register uh it has two uh eight gates and two

01:25:53.460 --> 01:26:01.220
 cv and it's generated from one gate signal and then another input um like whatever like whatever

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:05.380
 you want to send to it and this is where things get a little rough because my notes um

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:13.300
 a they got chewed by a cat and you'll see um yes and first off they're trying to make they

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:19.700
 are working to make it compatible with the um Turing machine expansions oh like pulses and yeah

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:25.540
 all of those um there's a reset input and what's interesting is it there's an uh

01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:34.260
 xor input adds random to it which I think is an interesting twist and that's a one new module

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:40.260
 okay yeah they're obviously fired up for making things in one new so um and then the other one is

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:46.820
 um Greg this might be up here Ali because you like a good comparator shoot uh this is called

01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:54.580
 reprosial this is probably like offensive level of like bad french like I'm I apologize to any

01:26:54.580 --> 01:27:01.140
 of our French listeners um so it's a comparator with um threshold and it has gates triggered and

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:08.020
 bipolar out depending on the input level and the threshold itself is cvable I like that yeah and

01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:15.620
 as a one you one you yeah I still don't have any one you compatible racks but I'm going to soon

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:21.380
 because there's a company that's making something pretty slick and I forgot to put notes so maybe

01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:30.180
 next time um but yeah there's something I'm tracking now on mod wigglers um these guys are making

01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:37.460
 racks that are intelligible you know compatible racks that fit in through you and that layers

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:45.780
 them up so you can oh shit you can have a row of three one you yes but they do do they do the power

01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:52.660
 because I've seen these they have something that is a solution for it I believe that's awesome um

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:59.140
 yeah so I don't know how it fully works yet but I'm paying attention I didn't pay too much

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:03.300
 attention to it just yet because the modules that I wanted that were one you were bigger than what

01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:08.820
 the racks were that they were offering right what they said that will be the next goal and they had

01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:13.940
 a little survey to see who's be interested in what sizes and what formats I can tell you only or

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:18.740
 other ones so I filled that out let them know that like the ones I wanted I think were 24

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:25.620
 HP one use like the IntelliJel multi-effects yeah the step sequencer I think those are both

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:33.540
 around 24 so yeah um I'll be able to join in the fun with you guys with one you shit hopefully you

01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:38.100
 and being able to sort of put it off on its own like that I don't know maybe it's just the way

01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:44.100
 my brain works but like the three you stuff is like the the meat and to have the little row

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:48.900
 sitting at the top on the little garnish yeah exactly and so good for utilities absolutely

01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:55.620
 yeah and and right now I don't have any one you space left every every fucking HP is taken I do

01:28:55.620 --> 01:29:01.860
 have some I was actually rearranging the one you stuff before I came over here and um switched out

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:06.660
 to another output of my gel 7u instead of the input because I need another stereo pair but um

01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:10.500
 I was thinking uh yeah I need to figure out what to put in there and I saw the

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:15.780
 comparator from ritual electronics and that was one of the ones that I was thinking might go in

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:21.060
 there yeah so I don't have a good comparator right now I don't either I have been using math

01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:28.340
 this is one which I usually do again I maybe I fall in love too easily Greg but I've really

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:32.420
 yeah I'm really really stoked on what ritual is doing um and

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:40.420
 I don't really want to get into the dread to the dread box nymphs yeah I have a lot like that's

01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:47.700
 super fucking offensive like fuck them maybe I did get into it and that's I can expand on it more

01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:54.020
 but I don't fuck them they're well they're pretty like not great defense about it right or like

01:29:54.020 --> 01:30:00.660
 they're like here's what we're doing to I only saw the edges of it and was like oh that's sad each

01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:07.380
 note sues the pain of an abused woman away fuck you oh yeah I didn't I don't think I saw that

01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:15.700
 that's fucked up so I missed all of this you missed yeah it I thought like originally when

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:21.060
 you were saying like you might touch upon it I thought you just didn't like the functionality of

01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:29.060
 Oh the scent itself is fine no the machine itself is fine I wouldn't have been interested in it it

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:34.740
 it seems a little underwhelming name didn't even like register on my brain yeah and I definitely

01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:41.860
 didn't hear this shit yeah they've got like a highfalutin but like incredibly misguided like

01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:50.100
 concept behind it and it's um really this is for this is dedicated to and for abused and

01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:57.860
 mistreated women okay and again maybe on paper that is not a bad motivation but then to trivialize

01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:03.700
 and use it as is like using trauma as a cross marketing scheme is fucking terrible and then

01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:11.460
 the say shit like each note sues their pain away it doesn't fuck you fuck you for trivializing

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:17.540
 yes kind of pain yeah it is that is horror is it like it's like pink to and do they need you

01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:24.340
 infer like oh this is you know it's a woman's you know there's everything it's like why do they

01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:29.460
 have to bring that gimmick into just just put the synthesizer out and then make a donation or

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:34.260
 something exactly yes there is a there was a way if you were genuine about your concern and you

01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:39.940
 wanted to be involved there's a way to do it and this was not it yeah they fucked this up and it's

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:44.740
 offensive you know like they were like they could have done this in such a way that was like genuine

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:48.980
 productive bringing like you know like hey this is something we need to talk about something that's

01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:53.620
 important to us that nothing about what you've done suggests you actually give a shit about this

01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:58.900
 yeah you just say that you donate x percentage of something to some organization and people like

01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:03.460
 I'll see that and be like oh shit I'll look to you for a few two things if you're just like low

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:10.180
 key like helping instead of like high key it's offensive shit exactly by our synthesizers

01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:19.700
 melt away people's dramas yeah it's not much problem works no so okay I I guess I did want to

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:26.420
 talk about it yeah I'm glad you did because I was totally unaware of any of this like I I

01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:32.580
 remember seeing the teaser for this like it was just like a shady video showing a box that you

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:36.340
 couldn't really make out and you know there was like some drones or something behind it and said

01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:40.660
 it would be revealed at Super booth and like I could make out enough of the box that I saw it was

01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:44.900
 just another like little analog desktop box and I was like well I'm not really interested in that

01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:50.340
 so it just kind of immediately fell off my radar I did not know that there's all this going on

01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:57.220
 controversy wise with it um but yeah I think it's good that you're bringing it

01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:08.500
 okay and others who might have also not been aware of that that's kind of shitty yeah yeah it is

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:13.620
 yeah yeah I mean it seems like their intent was good but yeah that's yeah there's definitely like

01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:18.980
 the the hearts in the right place maybe no yeah I mean as someone who has been diagnosed with PTSD

01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:24.660
 type of thing like if anyone ever if I ever saw a fucking synthesizer being marketed as like

01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:33.540
 you know curing people of their PTSD if you buy this it'll probably be a big fuck you from me you

01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:43.220
 know what I mean like what are you thinking yeah no interesting wonder where that came from

01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:47.940
 no and I don't know where it came from and why no one said hey this might be a business yeah

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:50.900
 like this is this is not how this is not how you should do this

01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:54.980
 I don't know I don't know the story behind it I just know that

01:33:54.980 --> 01:34:03.540
 I we just all be in result and it was yeah might want to scale that back a bit there trip

01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:10.980
 yeah I mean it sounds almost like it like a joke oh yes trivializing or you know

01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:16.740
 it you're right like if it's an important enough matter to you that you're gonna like make this

01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:22.020
 the subject line of your sin why would you follow it up with something like that that seems so like

01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:26.020
 that you're not taking it seriously or why would you not stupid joke about it right or why would you

01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:31.380
 not involve different organizations that are doing this work to try to actually actually have help

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:37.140
 not yeah which is a shame too because they have like reasonably priced decent sounding gear

01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:42.180
 the polyphonic uprising these are the most

01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:50.340
 lush digital reverb support charities for abused women we do the same very bottom of the

01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:56.020
 page it is literally the bottom of the page and northerly it's fine that's very big yeah they

01:34:56.020 --> 01:35:01.780
 don't specify what groups they are look at that graphic I didn't even notice the shadows of women

01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:10.420
 oh my god oh i didn't want to say what you're saying so that was okay i guess the shadowy thing

01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:18.020
 that i saw in the teaser was actually supposed to be the figure of women this is bizarre so here's

01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:24.660
 yeah here's the um here was the tagline the synthesizer is dedicated to all abused and oppressed women

01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:29.460
 may our voices unite and bring light joy and happiness to this world of injustice and

01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:33.700
 inequality each time you play a note on the synthesizer imagine that you sued their

01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:37.300
 pain away and you will become a better human being and synth player what

01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:44.900
 not even fun like i have to look at this one okay so you're dedicating a synth to abused and

01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:50.500
 oppressed women that's strange to begin with but then to follow it up with this like i don't have

01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:56.660
 to imagine i lived in a very broken home for a long time i saw a lot of a domestic violence occur

01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:02.180
 never once did i think geez i wish some fucking synth nerd out there was making a synthesizer

01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:08.580
 that would help soothe this boy like yeah what the fuck is that supposed to me i have no idea

01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:13.380
 that's what i'm saying this is just uh across the board misguided hey mom hold up don't call the

01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:22.820
 police dread box is releasing a synth it'll be all okay yes we'll be all right sorry i don't

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:27.460
 mean to take it that yeah no that's but no that's this is dark territory that it's dipping into

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:32.260
 and it's making light of it and it's in a very strange way i don't i don't wrap my head around

01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:40.020
 it at all it's kind of confusing me yeah and if they're trying to help it's not clear how they're

01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:44.580
 going about that or they didn't even say like x percentage of sales will be doing exactly like

01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:48.580
 not even listening what the charities are what they're doing i mean bottom line this synth is not

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:54.260
 helping with domestic violence exactly it's doing nothing for them but at the very least maybe they're

01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:59.140
 donating something but like you should fucking really make that clear like yeah that should be the

01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:02.980
 that should be the emphasis this is the group we're working with this is how we think this could

01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:08.340
 be important we're taking this seriously and these are the steps we're taking could be interpreted as

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:15.300
 virtue signaling to capitalize off of it a hundred percent like yes that's a hundred percent

01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:22.180
 so that was something that was on that's that super booth as well and the actual synthesizer as i

01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:28.740
 listened to it was like you said it was not what i thought you caught this because this one right

01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:34.820
 past me yeah completely and now i'm just kind of like now i need to i want to look more into this

01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:41.700
 advance and be like you know where is this coming from and why um interesting like noise

01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:48.660
 engineering they make it quite clear when they're when a module is being used like to you know

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:55.140
 generate revenue for them to donate to something yes cause like the cause is forefront right and

01:37:55.140 --> 01:38:00.500
 very clear and explicit this is the group you can research this group and find out for yourself

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:05.060
 if you want to help contribute to this group the message is clear and they don't market it as a

01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:12.100
 hey every time you buy a module you're saving a a penguin yeah exactly yeah something it's like

01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:19.380
 that would be completely false right yeah like how do you back up that claim like and it's not even

01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:24.740
 but it's not even buying it's it's when you play it you're like imagine soothing their pain oh

01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:32.660
 do you cannot and also do you understand do you understand how offensive somebody that you think

01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:40.100
 you're helping is taking this like you think that's all it takes is that really i can't i can't

01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.940
 help but like laugh like i can't get going because it's just so fucking absurd to me like that's

01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:49.140
 ridiculous but no i think you're right i think the noise engineering is an example of

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:53.700
 how you do it correctly and how you do it respectfully and how you do it in a way that like

01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:58.100
 like it's it's genuine and earnest and everything is upfront and forward facing like

01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:02.820
 that like that's the way you do this like if you're taking it seriously and they obviously are

01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:07.700
 very serious about this noise engineering i mean they're very serious about the causes they're

01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:12.340
 participating they don't have to be coy they don't have to be cagey they don't have to do it in this

01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:17.940
 absurd way yeah i don't know if i want to end on that on that no we gotta bring it back up what

01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:25.700
 else you got okay so i got um this one thing i did want to mention is um but facko the plethora

01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:31.540
 yeah so it is i'm going to preface this and this probably a shitty way to put it but like i don't

01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:36.020
 think i would need something like that now but there were definitely times like as i was like

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:41.780
 did more stuff with noise and did more stuff with like less gear there are there are going to be

01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:46.020
 people out there that are really fired up for this oh is it called the plethora it is called the

01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:55.140
 plethora yeah and um some of my notes are it's a hole in there's a hole through it um but it's um

01:39:55.140 --> 01:40:01.700
 three channels um and you have access to a database of noise textures and clusters that um

01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:07.700
 sequels over database it is all through sequel servers so you have to know sequel um but you know

01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:13.940
 there's a lot of built-in queries and joins you know you see two instances yes um so there's

01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:18.660
 independent outs and then there's a third channel of just dirty outputs and they have

01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:24.180
 gritty filtered and white noise and so the first two channels have independent filters

01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:31.700
 and like their own controls over these like databases of different noises and um textures

01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:40.500
 like samples yes but it wasn't clear like what the samples are or if they are generated through

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:44.020
 if there's something generative about them this wasn't like it's generating these textures

01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:49.620
 or is it just playing back it was not clear um there might be more information do they use the

01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:57.860
 term database they didn't literally use the term database um weary the module i like it um

01:40:57.860 --> 01:41:01.380
 but yeah i mean the sounds that they were getting us they were like going through these different

01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:09.220
 kind of able high availability yes for that secondary and crash oh god we're fucking nerds

01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:15.780
 yeah seriously tech nerds wow they use they just they use it's their fault they use the term

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:22.740
 they use the term database so database module but it sounds that we're getting uh like someone

01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:28.420
 who is looking for a small footprint to get a lot of different noise and textures um this seems

01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:32.420
 like it's got a lot of noise and textures yeah this seems like it's a fucking love database

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:40.740
 wow and it's everything and it's probably a buffeto we've got to get track record yeah um

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:44.420
 give it to you so there's one other thing i want to mention and this is not really related to the

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:51.380
 music oh i think it's um 100 hp no it's i think it was on the order of like 16 104 hp

01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:57.540
 someone said what is the widest module boy let's continue

01:41:57.540 --> 01:42:04.740
 listeners please uh we've got the thickest wide food what's the thickest bitch out there

01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:16.180
 well i had one thing i was surprised it was on your list i thought maybe you would bring it up

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:22.500
 is the wall roof one no no what is it uh the winter modular collaboration with plankton

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:30.980
 electron shit i didn't see them i didn't see it um at super booth i saw it oh was it i saw it from

01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:36.020
 their website they did a little teaser before super booth you know they posted a couple youtube

01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:41.060
 videos um given like an overview and things like that then yeah super booth was like the big reveal

01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:46.020
 showed off the oh let's go i somehow missed that yeah i just saw the the teaser mmm it was over there

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:50.980
 with the other plankton stuff they had some things that they were showing off oh cool um

01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:59.140
 i was pretty largely unfamiliar with plankton before this announcement um it seems like for the

01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:06.100
 most part they're just known for like releasing effects modules they uh they had something called

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:14.500
 spice it was like a big multi-effects box that had like a filter and distortion and their distortion

01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:23.380
 as it seems to be based off of this corg new tone inspired vacuum tube distortion okay okay um

01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:29.940
 not the first module to use that there was that plasma whatever the fuck yeah oh so you can take on

01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:36.980
 the aricle one yeah yeah plasma drive that's the yes i believe it's like a fluorescent tube oh yeah

01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:41.300
 remember this spice thing i was remember being kind of interested in this so some of the modules

01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:46.820
 they're showing off were like it's like they've broken down spice into individual components and

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:52.100
 released modules that were a little more versatile like you can get a dual distortion uh you know

01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:57.220
 using this new tone tube uh they had like the filter broken out and i think like an envelope

01:43:57.220 --> 01:44:03.460
 follower things like that yeah um which is cool nothing really caught my eye there but the zaps

01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:10.180
 percussion module definitely caught my attention um the concept of it and like the layout reminds

01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:17.460
 me very much of a vst plugin that i used to use and cannot remember the name of um i know i used to

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:24.660
 use it and plug but duel a lot um remember who made it nope i'm not micro tonic it was a slide no

01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:30.820
 it wasn't micro tonic um but it was some sort of drum synth it might have just been called drum synth

01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:36.500
 oh i think i remembered drum or something actually i forget that might have been something else entirely

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:45.300
 but i know it was like kind of like an FM based slider you know looking um not not too many bells

01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:49.620
 and whistles but i would hit it with a lot of randomization and plug with duel and bring it to life

01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:57.220
 yeah and make like glitchy percussion with it and this looks to be like the hardware version of that

01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:02.980
 you know i mean like it seems like the point of this is to not create static percussion but to

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:10.100
 create like evolving percussion oh that's cool which is like what i like to do in modular you know

01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:14.260
 are they going for something subtle like like no like a drummer would do or you're talking about

01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:20.900
 like full on like full on like like totally right not totally um yeah not sequence wise but like

01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:30.180
 parameter wise you make a drum sound that is constantly shifting um it has a lot of randomization

01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:34.900
 options like you can randomize the whole patch um and then you can save that as a snapshot

01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:41.780
 and then you can modulate your way through these snapshots that's a fun or you can just

01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:48.820
 CV the randomization options and you also have the ability to set what level of randomization

01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:54.020
 and on what parameters sort of like i used to do implode but duel so it doesn't have to be totally

01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:57.540
 wild randomization exactly like you thought along yeah right which is what i used to do in

01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:02.660
 bedoll with that type of thing and it was cool because you know you could have a sound that was

01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:07.620
 just shifting in certain ways and not in others you know every time it would strike or whatever

01:46:07.620 --> 01:46:13.700
 so the ability to do this with a modular now and have snapshots of it too that i could

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:18.900
 morph it has morphing too so you're not just balancing between yeah snapshot you can actually

01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:25.140
 like do morphing uh really exciting reactor kind of yeah maybe it was re-astered that i did this

01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:31.140
 yeah i can't remember at all but it's been a while but as soon as i saw it it like triggered that

01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:36.100
 memory in mind like oh this reminds me something that i used to use can't quite put my finger on it

01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:40.580
 but like regardless even if i didn't have like you know some sort of nostalgia for something like

01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:48.660
 that like in itself like of itself rather it's pretty appealing to me i've been trying to not do

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:53.140
 modular drums anymore but if i were to get back into it i think this would be the module i would

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:59.700
 grab in a heartbeat um it's it's a little weird to me that plankton is doing this because i don't

01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:05.700
 think they have any other sound generators or voices out but with winter module and with winter module

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:11.300
 on top of that he's kind of gone like a wall on the ela cleansing yeah like to say the least so like

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:17.380
 i don't know how i feel about this collaboration right like i don't like how winter has handled

01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:26.020
 the firmware for the ela quons are so far um but like i guess they were shifting focus to this so

01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:31.700
 maybe this got a lot of good attention it was used as a reason at one point not work on the ela

01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:36.020
 quons are for a minute it was like i'm working on something else now and it was this was i don't

01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:41.700
 know if we talked about this before but after not dropping that update the pandemic update uh since

01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:48.500
 like you know 20 to april 2020 um and it's still not out apparently um like oh we're working on

01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:53.700
 this instead even though it was like one fix that needed to be made uh to the code like a year later

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:59.620
 but yeah it's strange like what is the part that they're playing in this yeah maybe a manufacturer

01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:05.620
 maybe or yeah or maybe they were just adding like you know some of these generative functions to it

01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:11.460
 or something yeah i mean like i don't know like maybe the display um possibly plankton

01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:21.540
 actually maybe it's that because the ela quons are certainly as a display

01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:37.460
 people always ask why don't we just do this live oh my god there's reasons yeah there is reasons

01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:40.820
 i have so much dirt on all of you

01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:46.740
 fuck i mean that's 100 percent staying in right yeah i eat

01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:52.740
 no you're gonna be on the fence i'm gonna be very much on the fence that might be the um

01:48:52.740 --> 01:49:00.020
 me request my edit now to have you get back in yeah let's stay in all right maybe at the end

01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:02.420
 maybe after the outro okay

01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:15.940
 the after credits oh shit that's gonna be hard to keep in that's that's rough
