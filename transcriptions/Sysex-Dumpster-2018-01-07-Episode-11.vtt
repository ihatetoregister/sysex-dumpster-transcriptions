WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
 (dramatic music)

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.820
 - One of the things I was thinking of is,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.480
 we've talked about what we're looking forward to in 2018.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.660
 One of the things we haven't talked about is,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.020
 what would you like to see in 2018?

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.660
 What are some missing gaps that maybe could be addressed?

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.700
 - What I would like to see.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.860
 - Yeah.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.460
 - Right off the bat, more processing.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.140
 I feel like clouds and rainmaker,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.380
 the only two that dive into the territories

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.780
 of modulated granular processing.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.260
 I would like to see more of that.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.300
 I would like to see a higher fidelity version of clouds.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.140
 You know what I mean?

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.980
 - Yeah.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.980
 - With all the modes upfront, no more hidden treasures.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.100
 You know what I mean?

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.940
 - Yeah.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.340
 - And digging and memorizing key combos and shit like that.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.180
 Well, that's not true, I guess.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.020
 The morphogen kind of goes into that territory, I guess.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.540
 Also, but that I really didn't jive with.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.260
 You know, all the key combos and shit.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.180
 I just want something,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.940
 I don't care if it's a whole row in size.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.780
 You know what I mean?

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.580
 Like we need a really great granular processor

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.220
 that can handle multi-layered effects

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.180
 with everything upfront and easily accessed and CVable.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.860
 And in the year 2018, I feel like it's kind of crazy

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.580
 that that doesn't exist so far.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.420
 - Yeah.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.540
 - You know, the rainmakers, as close as it can come to that,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.380
 but again, you're only getting one layer of effects with that.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.220
 You know what I mean?

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.580
 It'd be cool if you could also layer in like a reverb

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.660
 on top of that or something.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.500
 You know what I mean?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.540
 - No, but I would like to see clouds mark two, you know.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.140
 - Yeah, I would love to see that.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.580
 - Such a good module.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.420
 - What about you, Nick?

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.260
 What would you like to see?

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.660
 - Well, working digitact.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.500
 (laughing)

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.260
 A digitact that doesn't frustrate the shit out of me.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.580
 So close, but so far away.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.660
 So, I don't know.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.580
 I'm betting they're gonna introduce some new products

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.420
 soon in that.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.580
 I'm just worried that they're gonna keep making new things

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.220
 and not finishing the things that they've made.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.860
 - I decided for 2018 I'm completely done with Electron.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.780
 - Yeah, I'm not gonna give them another shot.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.340
 - I've owned every box now, some of them multiple times,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.100
 and I always get frustrated with the limitations, you know.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.300
 And maybe just my own stupidity.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.460
 I don't know, but either way, I just don't jive with them.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.300
 - Yeah.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.740
 - Even if there's parts of them that I really like,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.740
 there's always like parts that I don't really like about them.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.820
 And then like, you know what, I give up.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.460
 I currently don't own any and I don't plan on getting any.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.140
 - Well, except for this year, the heat,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.260
 if you can find one for.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.580
 - Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.460
 I do have the drive, yes, thank you.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.140
 Which is about as basic as can be, you know.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.980
 And even that, I get frustrated with its limitations.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.900
 Like I don't know, but again, that's just an effect.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.740
 You know what I mean?

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.540
 It's their OS that I have the most issues with.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.060
 There really isn't one on the drive,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.140
 so no problem there.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.380
 It's just switching between different

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.940
 distortion circuits.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.500
 So I'll let them slide with that.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.140
 I'll keep that for now.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.700
 But other than that, yeah, I think I'm spent

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.060
 on trying to jive with the electron.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.060
 - Yeah, I know the feeling, even after the,

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.780
 I'll keep the rhythm, I've put a lot of time

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.820
 into it, I really like it.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.980
 But if it dies, I don't know if I would even get

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.220
 another one I'd probably just say.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.180
 That's time to move on and do shit with all their stuff.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.100
 'Cause other stuff is out there that can do it.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.780
 Put a little frustrated with their approach for some things.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.460
 - Do you ever consider going back to MPC?

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.300
 - No.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.140
 - With all the new shit they got coming up?

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.220
 - I don't know, I've heard so many things

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.020
 about that MPC live, not working very well,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.580
 and I feel like it'd be the same thing,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.340
 but worse, and that Kai's support is just like, ugh.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.420
 - I just know that you used to be like

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.860
 inseparable from the MC man.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.540
 - Oh yeah, at least fucking love this.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.420
 - You're one logo.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.420
 - Yeah, MPC.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.260
 - It's a good statement.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.180
 - Yeah.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.700
 - No, it's a good question, 'cause maybe,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.980
 I don't know, maybe the right MPC live

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.100
 that does work, maybe that would be awesome.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.940
 - Yeah.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.780
 - I don't know.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.020
 - I feel like they're the biggest competition right now,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.660
 as far as like hardware boxes go,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.580
 to things like the Octa and the Riddem and shit like that.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.540
 - Yep, agreed.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.100
 - How about you Dave?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.780
 - I said it earlier, I mean, the big thing I'm looking forward to

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.060
 is the Crystallizer.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.900
 - And you're talking about the future sound system.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.260
 - The future sound system, Crystallizer, modules.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.700
 I want that sonic terror in a module or a set of modules,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.580
 and that's a big one.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.620
 Another one I've been meaning to go back and revisit

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.380
 is the Kilpatrick Carbon.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.220
 - Mm, yeah.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.660
 - I really like Sequencer.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.780
 - I thought that was great,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.580
 it had everything that I was looking for,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.500
 sort of was interested and then slept on it,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.340
 and short of the pyramid being amazing.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.380
 That's something I can really see myself diving into.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.540
 What I wanna see is basically that type of control,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.220
 that type of workstation that integrates everything

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.180
 and can be that single point for everything that I wanna run.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.860
 I like the idea of just having that sitting there

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.460
 and I can plug in a sound module,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.820
 I can plug in my modular, I can plug this in

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.820
 and have this one control thing that I invest time learning,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.060
 and then I can use it for everything I wanna do.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.100
 - Something that seamlessly bridges the gap

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.060
 between your modular and your other hardware.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.980
 - Exactly, and right now--

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.180
 - Even software, I guess.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.900
 - Right now I don't have that,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.420
 and I've always been looking for that central thing that--

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.740
 - Something that isn't gonna cost you five grand,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.860
 or be overly complicated,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.660
 'cause I feel like those things do exist.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.100
 Again, the MPC is not the live, but the other one,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.740
 they want that to be that.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.580
 - Oh, the big one, yeah.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.580
 - The big one with the screen is shit.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.580
 - The fuck is that expensive?

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.620
 - I can't, yeah.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.740
 - But that is meant to be that in some way,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.060
 but it's like way, way overkill, yeah.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.500
 - That is not something that's in the realm of possibility

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.140
 for me to get.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.340
 - What's something that's at the carbon price point?

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.180
 - Yeah, exactly. - Like 500 bucks.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.140
 - I don't know, maybe it's unfair to put that in the,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.940
 I hope that comes out in 2018, 'cause it may exist already,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.380
 but if something was announced at NAMM,

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.860
 that was taking the pyramid or the carbon,

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.980
 or these other things, and nailing it even further,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.260
 I probably lose my mind.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.860
 - There's that new Skorp 1.2 Skorp mix,

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.500
 the pyramid, they have that hair mod,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.700
 which is the Euro Rack version,

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.500
 like an eight channel Euro Rack version

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.100
 of the pyramid kind of.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.940
 - Really?

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.460
 - Yeah, but CV Gate only just teased it.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.540
 - Totally missed that.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.860
 - A few days ago, it just was--

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.380
 - Oh, this is like a NAMHype belt.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.180
 - Yeah, it's kinda. - It's kinda.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.420
 But it looks very similar, like you can get the effects,

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.120
 the similar MIDI effects, but over CV and Gate.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.180
 It seems pretty cool.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.020
 - I would definitely like to see something more

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.380
 of a looper recorder module, this lesson.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.540
 - Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.140
 - The something they can multi-track.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.100
 I think the bitbox is getting there.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.620
 - They've made improvements, it's more.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.180
 - Yeah, I know they've made improvements,

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.020
 so I'm tempted to get one to see if I can do

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.060
 what I want with it, but at the same time,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.900
 it seems like those are features

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.300
 that they're introducing after the fact,

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.140
 and it wasn't really designed with that in mind,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.940
 so it's gonna be a bunch of bouncing around

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.140
 to get it to do that, and I don't know how well

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.100
 the slicing and that actually functions anyways.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.340
 - It was pretty good when I had one.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.940
 They were getting much closer with it.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.820
 I think it was pretty decent.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.260
 - 'Cause I would love to just be able to record

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.460
 like a 16 measure loop, and then be able to trigger

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.540
 the slices manually, and also bounce between

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.260
 what sections of that recording, the shit that I have

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.060
 to use my DAW for now, as I record chunks

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.740
 of the modular, record it, trigger it, move about it,

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.580
 navigate your recording, basically that one,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.020
 a Rex player module, which I think we've discussed.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.780
 I guess the other thing, I'm going back to 2018,

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.700
 but I guess this is an initiative anymore,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.700
 was the Intel Gel plug was unavailable for a long time.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.020
 I kept looking, this is something I want,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.900
 and it's available again.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.740
 - Yes, it is.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.660
 - I got the 2HB logic, and I'm always like,

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.220
 "Oh man, what if I had a NAND?"

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.620
 Or even just like a NOR, like having all--

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.220
 - What if you had all of them in the ability

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.460
 to CV between them?

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.860
 (laughing)

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.740
 It's pretty epic.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.540
 - That module's just-- - That module's

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.580
 just fucking astounding.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.900
 - It is.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.420
 Like I said, I don't know what the hell I'm doing

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.260
 with it for the most part, but I know I'm getting

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.580
 good results out of it, so.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.660
 The omni-mod.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.500
 - Oh yeah.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.340
 - People are getting them.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.180
 - It's out in the world.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.500
 - Yeah, people are getting themselves.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.020
 - Yeah, it's man.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.140
 - After three years of waiting.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.100
 - Three years of insanity.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.180
 - Is 2018 the year of the omni-mod?

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.020
 - I don't know.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.260
 I don't think anyone got one before the end of the year.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.260
 - So it is 2018.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.860
 - So yeah, I think we can count that as a 2018 first release.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.540
 - And none of them are DOA.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.380
 I mean--

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.220
 - So far?

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.060
 - Yeah.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.900
 - There's no manual.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.700
 People don't know what the hell they're doing with it.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.540
 - No, they don't.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.380
 It's the whole like--

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.660
 - People are trying to figure out how to use this thing,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.500
 but--

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.460
 - So it was like us with the prototype at NOPCON,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.740
 just going like, look at that.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.740
 That shapes where we are.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.100
 - Well, it looks like it doesn't even function like it did

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.900
 with the prototypes that we messed with.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.820
 - Yeah, I saw that, yeah.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.660
 - Like at all.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.020
 It looks completely different now.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.380
 I mean, the screen looks the same and all that,

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.540
 but like the functionality,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.500
 like there's different modes and shit.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.660
 'Cause like Ignatius, he keeps posting videos

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.060
 on Instagram and things like that.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.900
 And a few other people posted videos as well.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.020
 They're just like, well, I figured out how to do this.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.740
 Finally, after like 24 hours of messing with this,

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.740
 this is pretty cool.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.300
 I mean, what they're posting sounds awesome.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.140
 - It looks great.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.740
 - But like Ignatius, he was like,

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.180
 he was even saying like, I can't get this to reset.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.260
 He's like, I wish I could.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.060
 This mode 'em in, I got this sounding great,

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.980
 but I can't figure out how to make it go back to like the one.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.180
 And it's just like,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.100
 looping in a weird way.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.940
 And shit.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.780
 (laughing)

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.100
 So it's like, it's like adorable to watch people,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.300
 you know, like reverse engineer how to use this thing

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.220
 and come up with some really interesting sounding stuff.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.780
 Like I want one, but at the same time,

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.260
 I know it's just gonna frustrate the hell out of me.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.580
 Without being able to know how to navigate it.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.220
 But I'm tempted.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.060
 - Yeah, there were a few at Detroit Modular,

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.580
 like I posted there, like someone was like,

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.500
 you can get it right now if you want.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.700
 - Yeah, as soon as you posted that, I was like,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.740
 ah, should I, or should I just wait for someone

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.620
 to be like, fuck this and post it up used?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.700
 'Cause I'm sure that's gonna happen within the week.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.540
 - So is it like the flight of the navigator

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.340
 when the kid gets in the spaceship

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.940
 and doesn't really know how to work it?

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.060
 - Oh, firm enough.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.820
 (laughing)

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.540
 - I'm just still amazed it's out there.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.220
 - Yeah, it's just the fact that it's out

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.140
 is amazing enough from whether or not anyone can use it,

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.220
 you know, whatever, just the fact that it's out,

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.100
 it made it, it's a real thing now.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.340
 - The funny part was at the end

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.420
 when it was gonna be held up by some boxes.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.940
 They're like, no wait, we gotta wait

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.620
 for the official boxes to ship

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.620
 and people are just like, dude, fuck you, I will kill you.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.860
 Just send me the fucking mob.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.460
 - Throw it in some bubble wrap.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.300
 (laughing)

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.260
 - Yeah, mail that shit out.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.340
 The Verigate 8 apparently can be used to save presets with it.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.100
 You don't need the storage strip.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.980
 You do need the storage strip if you want CV

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.540
 to recall the presets, but yeah, apparently the Verigate 8

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.820
 can be used as storage with it on the same bus.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.940
 - So how do you recall, you can recall with the Verigate 8?

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.140
 - Yes, exactly. - Yes, even with the store.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.140
 You can recall, you just can't like use CV

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.500
 to bounce between presets like you can with the storage strip,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.780
 which would be cool and all but.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.900
 So I guess in 2018, we're all still looking for

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.740
 an ommemod that's not an ommemod.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.740
 (laughing)

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.860
 Someone needs to make a successor.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.820
 - There were people at one point trying to say,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.220
 oh, could you just put this, like make a program

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.460
 of the--

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.300
 - Oh and see?

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.460
 - Oh and see ornament and crime.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.500
 - Yeah. - They could do all this

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.500
 and they were like, not with the like, no,

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.660
 like no, no, and no.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.980
 (laughing)

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.900
 Not the same thing.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.540
 - Yeah, I have a new module from WMD,

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.300
 the MSCL compressor.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.820
 - Oh! - Oh!

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.660
 - I didn't see that.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.940
 - It's teeny tiny.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.820
 This little guy, pretty damn awesome.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.380
 And it's stereo so I can route, you know,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.420
 whatever through it, it's pretty awesome.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.060
 And it can do side chain, it can do limiting.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.300
 It has a plus 30 gain on the out end.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.140
 Like it's, yeah, it's brutal and it sounds great.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.940
 I'm really stoked with this so much though

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.500
 that I wanna get a second one.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.020
 I wanna daisy chain them and I wanna get stupid with that.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.100
 (laughing)

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.980
 I'm a big fan of using compressors as distortion too,

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.980
 which when you do that you lose all of its like

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.180
 compression effects, you know what I mean?

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.940
 You're just kind of like slamming it at that point.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.900
 It was like a super fast attack and release,

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.700
 you know, you get that like weird fuzz almost.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.380
 So I wanna be able to do that and compress it on top of it

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.140
 so that I can boost the outbound to the, you know,

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.420
 like the plus 30 that I can get on that shit.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.260
 - It's reasonable.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.660
 - And then slam it on top of that, you know what I mean?

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.620
 Just 'cause I'm stupid like that.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.540
 That's the type of shit that I have fun with.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.140
 But I've always had to do it software, which is shitty

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.620
 and finally I can do it with in hardware and slam

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.060
 some of my rhythmic noise patches.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:02.900
 - Is that new?

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.740
 I've not heard of this.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.580
 - It's pretty much new, yeah.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.420
 - Okay.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.260
 - Pretty new.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.620
 It came out right around the same time as like I think

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.980
 they announced the performance mixer or something like that.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.340
 It was so kind of fell under the hoopla

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.380
 surrounding the performance mixer, so.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.180
 - Those are still sweet performance mixer.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.500
 - I would still like one.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.580
 Yeah, I just wish it had more stereo.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.420
 - Yeah.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.260
 - That's the only thing that makes me hesitate.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.180
 - Two or something like that.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.060
 - I think it's two and a stereo send return.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.940
 - 2018 things.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.780
 - Yeah, 2018.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.460
 - Looking forward to the pyramid.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.140
 Very excited to get my grubby fucking mitts

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.860
 on another MIDI sequence here.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.100
 - Is there anything else that you covet or is it basically

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.100
 that's it?

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.180
 - Yeah.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.740
 - Might get one of those coma strums, the power,

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.020
 and shits because my one case can't even plug

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.300
 in my piston Honda right now because when I plug that in

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.460
 it like kills that monorocket power supply.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.300
 - Damn shit.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.740
 - Not 'cause it's fucked up, it's 'cause I'm exceeding

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.980
 some voltage 'cause there's the rain maker in there now,

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.300
 the piston Honda and a bunch of other digital shit.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.780
 - I can't believe that I haven't drained the power

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.260
 on my live case.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.380
 I have so much digital shit now.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.220
 - That's pretty good.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.140
 - Big digital shit like.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.980
 - Yeah, they're good ones.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.140
 Those dope for one.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:13.980
 - It's a dope for one?

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.820
 - Yeah.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.180
 - Yeah, I think that one in particular, that case,

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.340
 I think that's a Mark II power supply,

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.660
 and I think the one on the right is the Mark III.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.620
 - That's incredible.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.180
 With the amount of draw that must have right now.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.140
 - Yeah, that's why I've never understood what people

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.900
 like complained about the dope for power supplies.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.060
 Like 'cause I'm throwing about as much as you fucking can

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.860
 at that thing right now in that case.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.860
 Got the rain maker, the 352, the DDSP, the Formus STS,

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.500
 three Pico DSPs, almost everything in there

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.580
 except for the filters are digital modules.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.420
 You know what I mean?

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.260
 - And it's filled.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.420
 So what are people's complaints about it?

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.260
 - People have just bitched about them being dirty,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.180
 not enough juice, you know what I mean?

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.020
 On and on.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.980
 I've heard many complaints about them over the years.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.820
 I've never had any problems with dope for power supplies,

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.420
 but I have with others.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.660
 - Oh yeah, I've had Tiptop ones crap out.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.020
 - I've had Tiptop problems.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.220
 I've had Pittsburgh modular problems

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.780
 with their little rigs.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.620
 - Yeah.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.460
 - I don't know, I have zero complaints with dope for us

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.900
 while I still have the cases.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.700
 The Rugged As Hell, they're great for performance.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.900
 And I've never been able to max out power supply.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.980
 So I have no complaints with the mantises so far either.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.940
 - So, but that is a Tiptop power on the mantises.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.260
 - It is, but it seems improved over the Tiptop stuff

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.860
 that I've used in the past.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.780
 Happy ending kits and things like that.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.300
 - Well, those were the Zeus powers, right?

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.140
 - Right.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.620
 - I've given up on those.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.140
 It's a cool idea.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.500
 Oh, they're garbage.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.340
 (buzzer)

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.380
 - I know why it's so funny.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.860
 - It's so, weee.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.500
 It's such a weeny sound.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.420
 - Weeny over.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.900
 (laughing)

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.380
 - Dude, that's a disservice.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.220
 'Cause it's an obost.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.420
 It's a majestic instrument.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.100
 - No, they're making it not.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.380
 (laughing)

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.500
 - Oh no.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.740
 You have not given the obost respect to deserves.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.580
 (buzzer)

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.420
 - Brass.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.620
 (buzzer)

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.900
 - Yeah, that sounds nice.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.740
 - That sounds awesome.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.380
 - That sounds awesome.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.900
 - That's the first thing I knew was just a round in oscillator.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.060
 (buzzer)

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.060
 (buzzer)

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.740
 - Oh, that's nice.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.500
 - How many oscillators is it?

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.340
 - Two.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.340
 It's a two.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.660
 So it's different from the JU06,

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.540
 and that has got two,

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.540
 no pulse width.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.380
 (buzzer)

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.220
 - Oh, that's weird.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.060
 - You can just pulse width.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.060
 This one doesn't.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.220
 But I found a bunch of people say

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.060
 that they're like,

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.300
 this one and the most over the Jupiter EV.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.860
 - Yeah, I really wanted the,

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.060
 the O6.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.260
 'Cause I miss friend Juno.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.180
 I kind of want them all those.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.220
 Yeah.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.620
 I still want the SH.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.940
 - I still want the SH02.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.060
 I think I've got nothing, son.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.980
 - I think that's the, I think the what?

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.180
 - Let's do the electronic one.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.140
 - Oh.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.140
 - It's the most expensive,

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.620
 but after having this one,

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.020
 I've only had it for like a day or two.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.740
 So, but I want that O2, I think eventually.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.900
 - Yeah, really, that one's like kind of,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.740
 - Let's only talk about it.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.580
 - Not on my radar at all.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.140
 Yeah, I remember it's talking about it, but like.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.740
 - It's a super, it's a sleeper.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.740
 (buzzer)

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.580
 - I listened to the demos,

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.500
 it sounded good, but also it sounded very moody,

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.780
 which the demos suck.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.180
 (buzzer)

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.700
 (buzzer)

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.060
 - So I guess the differences between this

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.780
 and the real one, this has sin wave,

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.660
 better range on the LFOs and a few other things.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.060
 - You've had or have the real one of those, don't you?

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.660
 - No, I have the Jupiter 6.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.740
 - Oh yeah.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.580
 - And I was--

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.780
 - Oh yeah, you had the Jupiter, I had the Juno.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.620
 - Yeah.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.780
 - And what's this supposed to emulate?

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.780
 - The JX3P.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.620
 - I don't know what the fuck that is.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.900
 - That's the one that had the separate programmer,

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.340
 the little like silver, black box with the silver controls.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.180
 - I don't know.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.020
 - I put it on it.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.140
 'Cause otherwise it was just like a preset,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.700
 one slider and like buttons type thing.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.460
 And they made it so all the controls

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.260
 from the programmer on here.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.060
 I really like it.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.820
 - We should probably tell our listeners what you're doing.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.220
 - This is the Roland JX03, which is one of the boutiques,

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.940
 which is the little small key ones.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.060
 This is the knob one.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.460
 - I dig it, I think it sounds really good.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.620
 (buzzer)

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.300
 - I've never had this synth, so it's more like,

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.460
 I can get sounds from this that I can't get

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.460
 from the blowfeld or the virus, like quick like analog,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.060
 poly and mono patches.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.180
 But even as a mono, if it was just one voice,

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.420
 I think it would be worth it still.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.980
 - Kind of blows my mind that the O1

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.900
 has some poly stuff built into it.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.100
 And along with that unison by like,

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.940
 I really want that, but at the same time,

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.900
 I feel like that's not what you do with a--

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.900
 - No, it's a good one.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.260
 - Yeah, I'm like, it's kind of weird, but--

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.340
 - But it sounds great though.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.460
 - Yeah, this is modeled from the same,

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.900
 this both had the Roland IR 3109 chip,

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.220
 which the Jupiter, the 101, and this all have that

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.740
 filter chip used in different ways.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.500
 - Yeah, the filter, at least on the demos

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.780
 that I've listened to for the old one,

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.260
 was the only thing that sounded a little off to me.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.620
 - Mm, off how?

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.460
 - What were you hearing?

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.700
 - It didn't sound exactly like a one on one.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.620
 - Oh, gotcha, okay.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.460
 - You know what I mean?

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.220
 I didn't expect it to sound exactly like one.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.140
 I was just listening, I was like,

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.220
 "No, it sounds good, it sounds like a one on one,

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.020
 "but it's something a little off with the filter."

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.860
 - Right.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.860
 - So it wasn't quite there.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.440
 (upbeat music)

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.340
 - I assume we've long abandoned the oboe preset.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.860
 - Yeah. (laughs)

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.660
 - I think we're somewhere farther.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.900
 - It's pretty simple.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.420
 - You know, it's not a very complicated synth.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.660
 It has one envelope that you can shift the,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.380
 inverse the polarity on the filter and the amount,

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.340
 and then there's that one LFO.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.500
 You get more LFO waveforms than on the original one.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.020
 - How many did you get?

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.620
 - You get random and you get SNH and noise.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.700
 So there's just that one,

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.540
 but it's got increased range apparently.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.340
 - So one of the things we were talking about,

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.820
 of course, our recording was all of these parameters

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.780
 are mapable, the CC.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.260
 - Yeah, which was a later update after like a year

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.460
 of people kind of bitching, it seemed--

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.380
 - 'Cause that was why wouldn't you have a map of the,

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.220
 you know?

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.820
 - I looked at the map that was on the website

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.340
 and it was three parameters.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.820
 Like I would love to take, if I could make this happen

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.220
 like this, the blow failed and the micromodule

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.540
 and like a sequencer, that'd be awesome.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.420
 And you could fit that in like a bag or two.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.000
 (upbeat music)

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.700
 - So you still have an opt-of disc?

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.540
 - Yeah.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.380
 - Yeah.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.060
 - I sold mine when I got the fuzz factory for you.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.900
 - Right.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.100
 - Which I no longer have.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.420
 - Do you have nothing of the sort now?

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.020
 - No, I have a bunch of other weird distortions.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.140
 I have mostly germanium.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.780
 - Yeah, that star, I can't pronounce the company.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.580
 - Strocco roll or--

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.020
 - That's the module that we have that you build.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:48.860
 - Yes, yes.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.420
 - And that's the one that has the two germanium chips.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.220
 - 12 squam.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.580
 - Yes, that's it.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.940
 - But you have that awesome, that's the one I want.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.260
 - Yeah, it's a three-channel, so it's like three

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.700
 distortions and one.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.540
 - Yeah, pretty much.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.620
 - There's a crazy sale for that kit.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.860
 - Yeah, for the DIY kit, yeah.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.300
 I wish I would have gotten a DIY kit

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.500
 'cause that module cost me like three times

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.740
 as much as the kit.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:11.580
 - Oh shit.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.420
 - Oh seriously.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.260
 - I bought it, yeah.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.660
 Now you can get the kit for like a buck 50 years ago.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.380
 - When it was on sale, it was, I think it was

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.780
 around 100 or even less.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.500
 And I don't have room for it and I already have the--

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.700
 - That's like one channel.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.540
 - It is one-to-one.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.420
 - Yeah, I love it.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.700
 I think it's great.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.620
 - You like that.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.460
 - Oh god, I love it.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.380
 I've got to build mine.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.580
 That's like next on the list or second one.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.540
 - Now that I have it, it's in almost everything I do.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.540
 Even if I don't crank it to 11,

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.380
 just adds a little bit of teeth to the end.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.300
 - A lot of it.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.700
 - Yeah dude, germanium just sounds,

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.980
 you can add a little flavor to anything.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.220
 It just sounds fucking great, especially kicharums.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.580
 It'll beef it up, give it a little bit of distortion

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.620
 without sucking out the base.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.300
 - Yeah, I do that with the Polaris a lot.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.140
 Like Polaris, oh yeah.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:54.980
 - Oh yeah.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.980
 - Just to like touch things up.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.300
 - It's like, oh man, it always has that little magic in it.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.860
 When I hadn't turned my module on in like two months

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.020
 'cause I was working on other stuff.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.740
 And I turned it on and did a patch with 352 Polaris

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.780
 and the voltage block and the varigate 4 Plus.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.100
 And it was like, fuck, if I only had these,

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.580
 I would be like cool.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.260
 You could make like so many sounds

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.620
 'cause like the 352 into the Polaris,

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.180
 that's like a magical, like, I don't know,

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.260
 I love the 352.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.980
 The Polaris kind of just adds some grit

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.580
 to the weight of that oscillator kind of in my mind.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.380
 - You can do some goofy shit with it too, man.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.220
 - Yeah.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.060
 - You put it in notch mode and then you feed back

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.260
 one of the outs into the, you know, the cutoff

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.460
 and you start going crazy with it.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.420
 - So this is basically like 2017 wrap up or 2016 Plus.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.820
 - Let's get it Polaris.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.060
 - I think it's what we said last year.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.620
 (laughing)

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.940
 - I think it is.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.140
 You know, I was trying to think of what modules

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.780
 came out in 2017 that really blew my mind.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.180
 - Well, the formats.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.020
 - What's that?

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.860
 - Sampler.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.980
 - It was gonna be one of them and the 352,

00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.020
 which I think we've already rubbed off quite a bit.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.980
 (laughing)

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.580
 It seemed like 2017 there wasn't as much that came out

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.660
 as in 2016 and stuff that did come out

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.300
 was mostly like different takes

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.900
 on the same shit that's already out there.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:12.740
 - Yeah.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:13.580
 - You know what I mean?

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.460
 The only things that were really innovative

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.780
 was the 352, which I think just blows away

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.100
 any other like digital oscillator right now.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:21.940
 You know what I mean?

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.780
 - Definitely.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.100
 - It was set the bar pretty high with that.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.780
 - Very good four plus for me.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.620
 That was one of those.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.700
 - Oh yeah, that was squeezed out right at the end of the year.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.340
 - Yeah, which I think it's awesome.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:35.940
 It's a, it works more solidly than the very eight plus

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.180
 granted they have different features.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.660
 Like you can't do the real time record,

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.260
 which I kind of miss a little bit

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.260
 'cause that was just nice to tap in gates

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.780
 and stuff like that.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.740
 And you can't mute anything, which isn't too bad

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.340
 'cause if you have it in two by two split

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.620
 and maybe just mute it where you're sending it to

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.700
 or something, you know, it's not.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.620
 Like in eight channels, yeah, it would be super annoying

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.060
 if you couldn't mute everything it wants,

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.860
 but it was a sacrifice that I can understand at least

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.740
 and it works perfectly.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.140
 The CV bus stuff doesn't really work, but I don't use it.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.220
 - So what does the CV bus, what's it supposed to do?

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:12.900
 - Sending the clock and the presets

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.900
 to the other module, the voltage block.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.180
 - And so it doesn't work at all or is it flaky?

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.700
 - The clocking wouldn't sink for me.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.380
 And when I would just patch in the clock

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.020
 and the reset, just like before with the varigate eight,

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.860
 it works fine if you just patch it manually.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.660
 But after the bus, it wasn't even,

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.820
 they were resetting at different times when I tried it.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.300
 I don't know if there was some noise on there.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.420
 I don't know, but it didn't really work.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.740
 - Is that a cable between the two or are they using

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.380
 the bus of the-- - The straight power bus.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.460
 - The bus, yeah, no cables required.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.260
 - Right, it does, it keeps the preset between the two.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.660
 That syncs up correctly.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.860
 - But not the clocking doesn't work for shit.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.700
 It seems like they almost learned from their mistake

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.540
 with the varigate eight.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.380
 They don't want to make something

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.940
 where you can just update a teensy.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.140
 'Cause even on the four plus, there's no teensy to update.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.500
 I think they've skipped that.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.340
 - Oh.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.020
 - I'm an integrated it or put it all in one board or something.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.820
 - Voltage blocks is the same way.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.060
 There's no port on that one if I recall.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.500
 - So how do you update it?

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.380
 - There's a JTAG on both of them, but it's not USB.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.900
 The JTAG programming's like--

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.740
 - Right.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.660
 - I have the whole tool chain set up to do that

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.140
 and all that shit, so they make it so it's not.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.260
 Like they probably won't update that.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.620
 - I mean, I'd still really like to see

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.180
 an update to the voltage block

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.500
 that allows you to see where you're clock dividing

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.140
 in shift mode.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:31.980
 You know what I mean?

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.820
 - You never thought about that.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.500
 - Yeah, there's still no indication of that.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.540
 Only on global--

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.380
 - That's a good point.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.940
 - Yeah, I actually talked to Ben about it.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.260
 Like when I first noticed that, I was like,

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.100
 is this supposed to be like,

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.340
 'cause people brought it up on muffs too.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.660
 Or like, am I doing something wrong?

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.340
 I can't tell where I'm clock dividing.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.380
 And he said like, the feature to do it per channel

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.620
 and not just at the global level

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.420
 was like a last minute addition.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.540
 And I guess it wasn't like fully thought through?

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.380
 I don't know.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.900
 That's something I would really, really like to see.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:58.740
 - 'Cause that works really well.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.580
 - 'Cause that works really well.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.420
 - 'Cause you're shooting the dark.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.260
 - Yeah.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.100
 - It works perfectly.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.940
 - Yeah.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.420
 - Like all that stuff seems to be just great.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.300
 Whereas before some of it on the eight seemed like

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.220
 a little cagey, like the sliders would cause issues

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.340
 if you use them while you were editing on this one.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.180
 - Right.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.020
 - It's fine.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:14.860
 - Now can you link two of those

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.780
 and basically create a better, very good made post?

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.460
 - It's my main, I would love if they could add that.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.060
 But there's no like a end of sequence gate

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.020
 even that you could send out to like start something else.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:26.860
 - Really?

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.180
 That seems like a feature that would be really useful to have.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.020
 - Yeah.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.420
 And again, it's a kind of a, it made me realize

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.580
 like I missed the varigate eight,

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.140
 I sold it, got the four plus and I was like,

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.220
 oh yeah, I always want one of these with a modular.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.660
 But like, why didn't you just make like an eight plus plus

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.500
 or something?

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.100
 Like it has like this DSP chip or whatever

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.780
 that clearly works a little better.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.100
 (screaming)

00:26:48.100 --> 00:27:10.180
 - Nick, you got the pyramid.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.820
 - Yeah, it's on the way.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.700
 It's right now shipped from France.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.580
 It's somewhere between France and here.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.420
 I'm pretty excited.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.380
 I hope it pans out.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.620
 - Now have you read about people having problems with it?

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.500
 'Cause everything I've read has been somewhat glowing so far.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.740
 - Yeah, mostly glowing.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.140
 There are some software issues, but they've already said,

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.700
 yeah, version three is coming out at the end of January.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.300
 They're like done with major features,

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.460
 which is like great, 'cause I want them to be kind of done

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.580
 with adding major things.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.860
 Just make it perfectly solid, you know?

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.140
 'Cause right now I'm like,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.100
 a little frustrated with all the MIDI sequences I have

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.900
 'cause all of them are broken in some way.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.140
 - Right. - Slightly.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.540
 So I was looking at the pyramid.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.940
 One of the things that was interesting was

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.740
 that they have MIDI effects.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.580
 - Yeah.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.220
 - Which is something I've talked about in the past

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.340
 with the RM1X.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.420
 - Yeah, a lot of the same like quantize,

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.580
 core generation stuff, which may be a little different,

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.740
 but quantize, scaling, that looks really cool.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.380
 - Even like the little delay.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.580
 - Yeah, MIDI delay, which you know is super useful.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.380
 You would think like, why would you fucking do that?

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.460
 But then you use it and you're like, no, that's awesome.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.500
 - Exactly. - Like how they do that.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.580
 - One of the complaints is that you can't print the effects

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.820
 in MIDI, it's like, you can't record those

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.700
 as a MIDI file right now under the pyramid.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.660
 It's like, oh, I'm gonna have this effect loaded

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.300
 as part of a track and save it and I'll be able to use this.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.920
 So people wanna be able to render the stuff,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.340
 which is common, like MIDI box does the same thing.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.020
 Like a lot of synthesizers have that.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.740
 'Cause that's kind of difficult, you know, to re-render.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.220
 It's maybe not completely difficult,

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.180
 but the ability to re-render what you're doing

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.380
 in a way that records it.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.740
 Like there's gotta be a whole flow for that,

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.580
 which would be hard to replicate.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.820
 One of the coolest features about it that really attracts me

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:46.820
 is that you can record a song just by muting things

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.900
 and unmuting things and it'll track those changes

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.780
 and be like, oh, I've made this sequence for you

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.900
 just out of like muting and unmuting things,

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.940
 which for me, that's how my brain works

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.380
 when I make music kind of.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.340
 So if I can get closer to an arrangement

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.580
 by trapping that stuff that I do live,

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.540
 that's how it goes. - Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.940
 - Yeah, that would be super attractive.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.940
 - So you don't have to make a whole new pattern.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.420
 - Yeah, eight that is muted. - Yeah, that's muted.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.100
 - Five to eight, three or something.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.060
 - Now when you play live, you're pretty much patterned

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.260
 a pattern, right? - Yeah.

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.060
 - Have you thought about how you're gonna integrate

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.220
 this new idea with-- - Good question.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.180
 Yeah, if I could have bigger chains that I can rely on,

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.020
 that would be awesome.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.980
 So if that can make it be like that,

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.060
 where I can just mute and unmute from a big sequence,

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.580
 that would help me out.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.420
 I ended up keeping my fluxes.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.900
 I'm gonna hang on to it for a little.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.140
 - Okay.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.140
 - Modulation, I figured about modulation per step.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.180
 - Yeah. - That was like, all right,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.180
 I'm gonna hold on for a little

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.980
 'cause I always need modulators, I don't have.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.700
 - See, that's the thing I was really stoked on,

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.900
 do you look once or two 'cause it can do it?

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.180
 But again, with two voltage blocks,

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.780
 I don't know if I need it.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.020
 - You've got the Octo controller too.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.700
 - Yeah, I was telling Dave about that last night.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.100
 Like I was saying that like in the clip

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.620
 that I posted on Instagram recently,

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:57.780
 like most of the sequencing was coming from quantized loops

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.260
 that I made on there.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.100
 - Nice.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.740
 - Along with voltage block being triggered

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.300
 by rhythmic gates in logic.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.140
 - That's awesome.

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.980
 - And it's fun and it's cool way to do stuff

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.940
 and like at the moment, I wanna try to squeeze

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.940
 as much as I can out of that.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.500
 As much as I would like an elo quencer,

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.900
 I'm like, if I get one, I'm just gonna go right back

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.700
 into the standard way of sequencing shit.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.300
 Whereas like now my hands kind of forced

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.260
 to get a little weird with this shit and I like it.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.740
 So I'm gonna keep rolling with this

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.340
 at least until I finish probably a little EP.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.260
 - So for our listeners, can you explain

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.660
 what it is you told me tonight?

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:39.500
 - Well yeah, the Octo controller, you know what I mean?

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.660
 You can loop sequences of gates or,

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.180
 well randomly generated gates or randomly generated CV.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.220
 And you can change clock rates of that,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.980
 loop it, quantize it, do whatever you wanna do with it.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.580
 And I was having a lot of fun with that.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:59.500
 Like just dialing in chunks of like generated loops

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.540
 and you know, locking that loop in place

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.740
 for you know, measures at a time.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:08.420
 And kind of playing with it live so to speak.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.740
 And then I have a shit ton of generative

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.980
 and rhythm based gate sequencers now.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.580
 I have the Tuesday, I have the grids,

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.420
 I have pretty much everything by noise engineering.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:26.420
 And I was creating probabilistic sequences

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.380
 and logic sequences through the plug with that

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.620
 and also triggering my two voltage blocks

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.220
 from different rhythms.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.300
 You know, to generate things and like make this

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.220
 generate stuff, use the two HP ARP,

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.740
 the tonets by noise engineering.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.540
 And like the two HP ARP that is triggered by gates.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:48.580
 So you know what I mean?

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.380
 Like I was doing like slow rhythms to it

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.980
 to make it, you know, step, things like that.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.220
 I was just doing weird shit like that

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.420
 instead of like doing conventional like step note

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.860
 gate sequencing, you know,

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.500
 I currently don't have any sequencers that really do that.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.740
 And I'm gonna intentionally keep it that way for the moment.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.260
 - Now what do you send in the two HP ARP to?

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.580
 Like when you send it gates, what do you end up like

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:14.580
 triggering or sending voltages to from it?

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.660
 - The patch that I was doing,

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.980
 I was sending it to the MANUS, it's here at Toss.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.820
 - Oh, okay.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.020
 - Scaling the voltage coming out of it

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:25.820
 through a attenuator and routing it to the MANUS.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.340
 I don't have the beat step per hour anymore.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.300
 I don't have the fluxes.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.340
 I don't have any normal step sequencers

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.140
 trying to just force myself to get a little creative

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.660
 and utilize like generative patching.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.020
 Organized chaos.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.020
 - It's a beautiful thing.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:40.860
 - I like it.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.060
 - It's another big thing with the pyramid.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.900
 Another like pyramid thing I didn't mention

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.620
 is it does CV to MIDI, which I've never tried before.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.580
 And I'm really curious about 'cause with the Fergate 4 Plus

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.540
 there are only like 16 presets.

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.580
 So if I could record some of that stuff

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.180
 and apparently you just set like a root note

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.500
 and then send the voltage is in

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.020
 and it kind of does the rest.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:00.860
 - Figures it out.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.340
 - Yeah, we'll see.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:06.780
 - Yeah, recently really upped my noise engineering rig.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:07.740
 - Yeah, you did.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:12.740
 - It went from a couple BIA's to three and two curses

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.900
 and one man is and--

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.740
 - Wait, hold on.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.140
 Is it gonna be a smaller list

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.180
 if you just say what you don't have?

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.340
 - Probably.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.260
 Yeah, I think one of the only things I don't have right now

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.980
 is like the mimetic sequence or whatever,

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.300
 which is the CV recorder,

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.220
 or looper I was talking to you about.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.420
 But I pretty much have at least one of everything else.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.580
 Except for the confundo funkitus.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.660
 I've been having problems finding that.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.780
 I do want it.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.260
 It's just either out of stock or everywhere

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.820
 or I see people selling it used

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.900
 and by the time I get ahold of them it's already gone.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.500
 I've been trying for weeks to get ahold of one.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.860
 - And which one is that?

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.700
 What is it to?

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.580
 - That is the rhythmic probability crossfader.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.900
 You can send two different rhythms in

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.980
 and then you can crossfade them between a manually

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.940
 or control that with CV and it'll, you know,

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.660
 based on probability percentages will fade

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.300
 between the two rhythms.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.860
 - Now you still have a probably model, right?

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.700
 - Yes.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.820
 - So I mean, could you do something similar to that with

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.540
 the probably like a crossfade model?

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.380
 - I could.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.340
 I have in the past.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.860
 That's one reason why I want this.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:20.700
 (laughing)

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.460
 I was doing stuff like that in the past with, you know,

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.940
 switching and probabilistic gates from the very gate,

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.780
 triggering switches, you know what I mean?

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.740
 To determine between two different rhythms

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.060
 and things like that, but it'd just be nice to have this

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:36.300
 in all in one package and also have the manual crossfader,

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.460
 which I think would be a lot of fun.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.300
 - Yeah.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.460
 I mean, also if you're a completist,

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.980
 you know, you're really close to giving.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.100
 - The whole collection.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:43.940
 - Yeah.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.100
 - Yeah, I don't have any other malts either.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.020
 Like I don't have the mullet and things like that.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.700
 I don't really have malts in my system.

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.540
 I use stackables for everything.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.820
 Yeah, the noise engineering stuff has become my drum machine.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.660
 You know what I mean?

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.740
 So I just haven't been happy with or satisfied

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.700
 with any drum machines that I've been using lately

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.620
 to do what I want to do.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.020
 You know, the rhythm didn't quite cut it for me.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:05.940
 It was close.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.860
 It was the closest that any machine has got.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:08.700
 You know what I mean?

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.540
 It was the rhythm.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.540
 Kept the mutant beating nine in there

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.460
 for a little bit of analog kicks.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.300
 - Yeah.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.220
 - You know what I mean?

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.780
 I got the MFB hats in there.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.340
 - Yeah, we're talking about the MFB hats before we started

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.180
 recording.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.420
 What is it about them that's cut your attention

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.980
 versus other ones you've tried?

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.820
 - It just sounds good.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.660
 I don't know.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.220
 The hats that I used the most up until this point

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.660
 were the mutant hi-hats.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.660
 They were good, but at the same time,

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.420
 not too versatile and they were out of tune with each other.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.420
 So you couldn't have them both being triggered

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.420
 at the same time it would sound off.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.260
 You know what I mean?

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.620
 I don't know if that was just a problem with my module

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:47.580
 or if it's just a problem with that module in general.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.300
 I don't know, I know it got on my nerves.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.940
 - So we've all this stuff hooked up.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.060
 I can give us a little taste.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.980
 - There it is.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.220
 (tapping)

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:08.460
 Let's get some cymbals in there.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.260
 Got some grids, griddin' some hats.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:19.820
 So what controls do you get?

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.900
 You get a tune it sounds like.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.660
 And then you take it, you get tune,

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.660
 decay for everything and a cymbal tone also.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.380
 It seems as if it just kind of like filters

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.220
 and noises on it.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.060
 - Mm-hmm.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:39.940
 - Oh, wow, that was nice.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.540
 - Man, it's a hats.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.540
 - It's a hats model.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.380
 - It sounds good.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.220
 - Diggin' it.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.060
 - Yeah.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.620
 - I do hear that phasing.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.460
 - What?

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.300
 - It's that.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.300
 - Oh, it's the power supply.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.060
 It's not even hooked up via audio.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:54.900
 - Wow.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.300
 - I think it was that preset.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.460
 - Everything's music.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.620
 - Apologies listeners,

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.620
 if you've been hearing amazing sound.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:01.620
 - Crisis averted.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.180
 - You have not been going insane.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.140
 There was a slight phasing sound.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.820
 It was caused by the JX-O3.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.140
 - It's caused by engineers trying to emulate

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.380
 fuck ups from the past.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:12.380
 (laughing)

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.860
 - Successfully, I would argue.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:14.700
 - Oh yeah.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.540
 - That was mad night.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.380
 - Mm-hmm.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.020
 (laughing)

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.260
 (drumming)

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.500
 (drumming)

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.740
 (drumming)

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.980
 (drumming)

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.220
 (drumming)

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.460
 (drumming)

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.860
 (drumming)

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.060
 (drumming)

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.460
 (drumming)

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.700
 (drumming)

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.100
 (drumming)

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.500
 (drumming)

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.700
 (drumming)

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.700
 - That's all.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.940
 (drumming)

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.300
 - Yeah, it's centered.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.860
 I think that's way too high.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.700
 - That's it.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.980
 (drumming)

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.300
 (drumming)

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.540
 (drumming)

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.940
 (drumming)

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.900
 - I mean, it's that way, like,

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.500
 on a shape, like, digital, easy,

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.500
 (drumming)

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.860
 - I fucking said everything was awesome.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.620
 (drumming)

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.620
 (drumming)

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.980
 - See, it's definitely not like

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:22.980
 look how it turns.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.980
 (drumming)

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.500
 - Yeah, very different.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.300
 (drumming)

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.500
 - It's not really changing.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.940
 (drumming)

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.340
 (drumming)

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.780
 (drumming)

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.100
 (drumming)

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.540
 (drumming)

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.860
 (drumming)

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.020
 - Yeah.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.260
 Holy shit.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.260
 - That is the curses.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.300
 - Just that is a demo.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.420
 It sold me more than some of the initial demos

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.260
 I saw about.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.900
 (laughing)

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.260
 - Yeah, dude.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.780
 I mean, I wasn't paying much attention

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:56.780
 for a long time either.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.340
 And then, like, soon as I got one,

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.100
 just like on a gamble,

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.460
 'cause Steve and noise engineering,

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.580
 like actually, like,

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.420
 hyped it up to me.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.300
 Like, I was telling them, you know,

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.340
 I had three B.I.A.s and this and that,

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.180
 and he was like, "You need a curses."

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.180
 I was like, "I don't know, man."

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.100
 I was like, "The demos I've kind of,

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.940
 "you know, heard and watched about it

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.220
 "and really sold me entirely."

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.580
 He's like, "You need a curses."

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.700
 I was like, "All right."

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.220
 And so I got one,

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.220
 I wrote back to him, I was like,

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.620
 "Yeah, thanks for the recommendation."

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.980
 I was like, "This thing's pretty damn awesome."

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:26.820
 He was like, "Yeah, he's like,

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.060
 "it's one of our sleeper modules."

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.180
 You know, I guess a lot of people

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.580
 haven't realized its potential yet.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.540
 - Hopefully you've changed the modus with this.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.980
 - Yeah, well, he changed my mind, you know what I mean?

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.820
 'Cause he posted,

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:41.580
 he's been posting some pretty awesome demos

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:42.420
 on YouTube.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.140
 Not demos, but just like jams.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.220
 - Yeah, just kidding.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.380
 - And I hit him up, I was like,

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.220
 what was all going on in that patch?

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.260
 I was like, 'cause that sounded great.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.660
 And he had like three curses and three BIAs

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:53.780
 and things like that.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.020
 And I was like, "Well, I'm well versed with the BIA."

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.100
 I was like, you know,

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.940
 some of those sounds I definitely didn't recognize.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.940
 I was like, "So I'll give the curses a shot."

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.220
 And yeah, it's pretty awesome.

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.740
 - How do you feel about the Manus?

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.180
 - No, I haven't been there for awhile.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:10.220
 - The Manus, I'm a little mixed on.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.020
 I like the Manus, it has pretty aggressive sound,

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.900
 which I dig, but like I remember I wrote

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.780
 to you guys when I first got it and said,

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.620
 it's kind of like compared to all the other

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.980
 noise engineering oscillators I have,

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.180
 I feel like it's the mall goth edition.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.020
 You know what I mean?

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:30.300
 It's just trying too hard to be edgy and aggressive.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.620
 - It just walked out of hot topic.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.700
 - It's just hanging out at hot topic.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.420
 - All black next to the silver panels.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.260
 - Yeah.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.180
 - Hey, I'm dark.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.460
 - Whoa, what's going on?

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.900
 Oh, there's that weird thing again.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.420
 You sound like you're through an old radio.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.260
 - Is it better?

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.180
 (record scratching)

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.020
 - What is wrong with this?

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:48.860
 - There it is.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.660
 - Oh yeah, all right.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:51.500
 - Good now.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.700
 - I mean, it was a cool effect.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.620
 - It was, sounded old timey Dave,

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.140
 but yeah, I like it.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.340
 I just feel like, well, let me just say

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:01.100
 that the one thing I really don't like is the

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.300
 encoder pitch knob.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.860
 - What does that do?

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:08.740
 - You spin it for all eternity to try and adjust your pitch.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.980
 - Did you realize that was like that?

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.860
 - I hate that.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.780
 - Oh yeah.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.020
 - Can you send it to CV?

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:14.860
 - Yes.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.940
 And that's what I've been doing to dial in.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.180
 I've just been using like a channel off the voltage block

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.460
 to dial in where I want to say.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.900
 I hate endless encoders on any piece of gear

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.940
 that I've ever used and want to like always.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.700
 I just, I don't know, that's just me.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.940
 I like figuring out sweet spots.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:32.580
 And you can't do that on endless encoder knobs.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.420
 You know what I mean?

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.060
 Like you're just constantly oversteering

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.340
 and then adjusting where you want it.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.380
 And it's just that encoder alone is kind of like

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.860
 making me not want to touch it sometimes.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:42.700
 You know what I mean?

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.140
 Like I'll hop on the curses or the BIA

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.620
 and I can feel out exactly where I want that pitch to be.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.740
 Before I hit it with CV.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.060
 You know, I know I can dial in and I can tune it.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.660
 I know where exactly where it needs to be.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.140
 But with the endless encoder,

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.460
 I'm just like constantly trying to feel that out.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.300
 - So short of the endless encoder problem,

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.020
 are you getting sounds out of the madness that you like?

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:01.860
 Or is it still like?

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.700
 - I am.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:03.540
 - Do you still need to process it?

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.860
 Do you still need to like sort of like

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:05.900
 give it a little help?

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.900
 - I'm definitely getting sounds out of it I like.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.420
 But I feel like between the three modes

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.460
 there's not a huge amount of difference.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:17.060
 - I feel like you have to like strain to hear the differences.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.260
 They're more subtle.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.220
 - That's weird because the Lekel, yeah.

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.700
 I mean, I'll have like something set up

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.540
 with one of the modes.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.780
 I'll be like, this sounds really good.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.420
 And I will routinely just check to make sure

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.260
 - Your modes, sure.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.100
 - The other modes just be like,

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.380
 have I accidentally come across something amazing?

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.220
 - Yeah.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.780
 - And it's not uncommon for me to just switch what mode I'm in

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.180
 just because I've accidentally come across

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.700
 like this amazing setting.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.420
 - But it was in a mode I wasn't even working in.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.260
 - Yeah.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.180
 - But they're tremendously different.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.900
 - Yeah, I wouldn't say you've,

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.660
 there's less happy accidents that way with the manis.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.460
 Also the manis I feel really shines

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.980
 with more of the low endish side of things.

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.940
 It's definitely like a base synth.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.100
 - Which is the problem.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:57.940
 - You know what I mean?

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.460
 - Yeah, so it's not a problem,

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:01.780
 but it's also kind of limiting.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:02.620
 You know what I mean?

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.620
 Like I feel like if there was a mode in there

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.940
 that really shined on higher end,

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:07.780
 you know what I mean?

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:08.620
 - Yeah.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.420
 - Then it would be more worth it instead of like three modes

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.060
 that are a little subtle between each other.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.820
 And you know, when you're only gonna be working

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:17.260
 within a very specific range on it.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.420
 - Are you thinking of keeping it?

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.260
 - Yeah, oh yeah.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.100
 - Okay.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:20.940
 - Absolutely.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:21.780
 I'm gonna keep it for what it does best

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.980
 and that's basically synth sounds.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:24.820
 You know what I mean?

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.420
 Will I be going to town modulating the shit out of it?

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.300
 Like a BIA or bouncing between the modes?

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.420
 Like on a cursus, probably not.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.380
 You know what I mean?

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.780
 It's gonna be more of a set it and forget it type of

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:38.740
 module I think, you know,

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.300
 especially 'cause like again,

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.660
 you can't find the hotspot you went on the pitch.

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.060
 So you're gonna like dial that in

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.500
 or tune it with CV and leave it there.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:50.540
 The sync, a tier, that also has the endless encoder.

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.700
 And I don't mind it as much on there

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.220
 because I usually use that as like an LFO

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.700
 or a noise module, you know what I mean?

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.740
 Things like that not like a direct lead.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:03.140
 It's more like a secondary oscillator or a modulator.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:03.980
 You know what I mean?

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.900
 So I deal with it there.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.860
 Also the range on that thing is crazy.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.100
 Can you remember how far down it goes?

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.420
 'Cause like 20 octaves or something.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.420
 Yes, ridiculous amount of octaves.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.420
 So, you know, an endless recoder

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.380
 for something like that makes sense.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.700
 'Cause you got so much territory to cover.

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.380
 On the manis, I don't think it makes sense.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.740
 And it just kind of makes it not jive

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.740
 with the other noise engineering oscillators.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.980
 I can plug it in, we can have a listen.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.740
 (engine revving)

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.980
 (drumming)

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:41.260
 - Yeah, between the modes right now.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.100
 - Yeah.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.100
 - Now here is a different.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:43.940
 - Yeah.

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:44.780
 - Oh, weird.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.020
 (drumming)

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.620
 - I just built this.

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:52.140
 - Go here and open a deficit in the mic.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.540
 That's all you got here.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.740
 - It's got its own envelope, right?

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.060
 Like the BIS.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:58.900
 - Yeah.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.580
 - Perfect budget.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:02.100
 Can you disable the envelope?

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.540
 (drumming)

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.100
 - I'm not being prepared.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:05.940
 - Look at it.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.380
 (drumming)

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.420
 - So let me clarify.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.780
 You can't make it free running,

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.420
 but you can open up the VCA.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.260
 If you said it,

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.620
 (drumming)

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.060
 like a decay with a black maverick.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.320
 (drumming)

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:30.260
 And that's, you know, if you have the decay down.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.520
 (drumming)

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:38.540
 - Yeah.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:39.380
 It sounds awesome.

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.020
 It's just,

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.260
 it's a little different from the other

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.100
 who is engineering stuff.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.660
 You know, as far as like,

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.300
 feeling out what you want

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.660
 and balancing between the modes and things like that.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.380
 We got the Intel gel mix up.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.380
 - Did you actually get it?

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.220
 - Not yet.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.540
 - That's on pre-order from a perfect circuit.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.420
 It was the two final things that I bought using the holiday

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.340
 discount,

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:02.740
 but they weren't released yet.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.580
 So I got them on pre-order.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:05.940
 Some people already have them,

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:07.940
 people that have ordered directly through Intel gel.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:11.780
 So I guess distributors got them a little late.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.700
 - But we can review that next episode.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:14.980
 - Next episode.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.300
 Which will be the interview?

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.300
 - Should we tell our listeners who we're talking about?

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:21.140
 - Yeah.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.940
 We're gonna be doing a live interview

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.980
 with Steve and Chris of Noise Engineer.

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.900
 - Woo hoo.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.740
 - Woo hoo.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:31.740
 - We all have multiples of that.

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.900
 - Well, I just complained about

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.620
 their rotary knob on Manis.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.100
 - Is that finally,

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.820
 finally we have a Noise Engineer in complaints.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:41.100
 - Is that all we're gonna talk about?

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:42.140
 Is the rotary knob?

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.460
 - We'll just

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.220
 - Shit talk them for an hour.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.060
 - Real them like a fucking like.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.860
 - Like what the fuck were you thinking?

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.620
 - Call the episode the rotary mistake.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.860
 (laughing)

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:51.940
 - So about your flaws.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.060
 Let's see if you can do that.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:56.660
 So now that your legacy will be endless rotary knob.

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.300
 (laughing)

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.300
 But yeah, much, much hyped about that.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.780
 'Cause they seem like some really cool individuals.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:03.620
 - Yeah.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.200
 (upbeat music)

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.780
 (upbeat music)

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.360
 (upbeat music)

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.940
 (upbeat music)

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:29.500
 (upbeat music)
