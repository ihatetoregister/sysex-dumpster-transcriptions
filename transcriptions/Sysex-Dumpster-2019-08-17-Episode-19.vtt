WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:27.280
 - You're welcome to episode 19,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.540
 66 Junction Blockhead.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.460
 - Bada, tah.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.720
 - Today, we got a special guest, Joe Rogan.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.980
 (laughing)

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.680
 - Yeah, we just kick him out now.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 - Think about being an Alfred male is,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.440
 you gotta eat so much meat that you fucking out,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.280
 fight people.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.700
 (laughing)

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.540
 Jesus Christ.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.480
 You put your hands to be the consistency of pork chop.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.520
 (laughing)

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 - Plus, aren't those episodes like two and three hours long?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.320
 - They're longer than that, too.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.440
 They're really long.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.480
 - I'll catch the highlights when it's like a guest

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.480
 that I give a fuck about.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.320
 - Yeah.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.160
 - For the most part, I'm just like,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.600
 there's no way I wanna listen to this guy babble

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.440
 for four hours.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.520
 (laughing)

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.960
 - The only one I liked was the Paul Stamets one,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.240
 the mushroom guy like my collegeist.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.060
 - Mm.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.320
 - I know, that was super interesting

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.240
 'cause of his content by every other one.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.080
 - Bada.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.920
 - Yeah.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.160
 - I can't pay attention.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.800
 There was, what the hell?

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.080
 - Why can't, Elon Musk?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.000
 - Yeah, I like that one.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.680
 And I like the one with the most recent one

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.360
 with Maynard from Tool.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.200
 - Oh, I didn't see that.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.080
 - He was just talking about like disconnecting

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.360
 from fucking society and living in the desert

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.920
 in Arizona and growing wine.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.400
 That's the only thing that keeps them sane.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.760
 It was pretty, it was interesting.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.920
 I liked it, you know what I mean?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.200
 - Might check that out.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.120
 - Sure, they talked about Jiu Jitsu a lot.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.960
 - They did.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.960
 - Talking about fighting.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.160
 - I didn't know that he was, he trains in that stuff.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.040
 Apparently he has for like 30 years.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.000
 At some point he had a replaced hip.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.240
 So now he has to be like extra careful when he does it

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.400
 but like he has a fucking bionic hip.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.240
 - Damn.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.060
 - Yeah.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.640
 - That's what I said is like it sounds painful.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.200
 - Because there are videos of him taking down

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.280
 like bands on stage.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.120
 - Yeah.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.280
 - And he's like, "Oop, expertly."

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.120
 He gets rid of them.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.080
 - Just puts them on their face.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.640
 - So, Greg has a list.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.400
 - It's not really a list, just a few points of shit

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.560
 that I had to do. - There's a lot of words

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.760
 on that screen.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.600
 - I tend to babble to myself a lot.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.480
 Most of this is off topic shit.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.520
 But if you'll allow me.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.360
 - By all means.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.720
 - I can venture off topic for a moment.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.560
 - Yes.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.320
 - I wanted to bring up the Chernobyl soundtrack.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.400
 - Oh, yes.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.400
 - Which was an amazing series.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.240
 - Both of you watch it.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.320
 - I've not seen it.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.160
 - Okay.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.000
 - I don't wanna spoil it.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.840
 - Full recommend?

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.680
 - No.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.520
 - Two thumbs up.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.360
 - Okay.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.200
 - I love that from start to finish.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.800
 It's hard to say that you love something like that

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.640
 when it's so fucking dreary and based off of reality,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.560
 but it was incredibly well done from every point.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.560
 You know what I mean?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.120
 And the reason why I was gonna bring it up here

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.980
 was the sound.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.480
 - Yeah, 'cause I didn't watch it,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.560
 but you explained the soundtrack and how it was made.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.800
 So I went and looked that up just on its own.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.680
 And it's incredible.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.600
 - Yeah.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.080
 It's by a woman named,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.720
 I'm probably gonna say this wrong of course,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.640
 but Hildor,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.000
 Gudin,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.360
 Gudinaditor.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.480
 - Apparently she used to collaborate with Johan,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.800
 Johan's in a lot.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.360
 Like they worked on the same scores together.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.060
 She was basically his celloist.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.360
 And she's also done stuff with throbbing gristle,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.440
 moom,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.080
 like her resume was impressive.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.360
 'Cause I'd never heard of her up until this show.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.720
 It made me wanna like look into her

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.720
 and then like I'm going through like her Wikipedia page

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.540
 and all this.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.380
 I'm like, holy shit.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.720
 Like all the scores that were like my favorite by Johan,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.040
 she had a hand in like Scario.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.480
 She rolled with the sequel on her own

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.960
 and she was like,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.000
 she's gonna be doing the new Joker movie.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.080
 - Joaquin Phoenix.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.920
 - Yeah.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.760
 - Thank you.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.920
 - So interesting resume of like dreary stuff.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.600
 And she was talking about how for this show,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.680
 she wanted to go to a power plant.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.400
 So she actually got permission to go to the location

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.240
 where they were gonna film,

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.880
 which was an abandoned nuclear plant ahead of time

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.280
 and just get into the vibe of it.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.160
 And she said she was trying to locate the character

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.680
 of this plant.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.040
 And so she was doing like field recordings

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.760
 and like recording acoustics.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.680
 Like she'd play cello there and record that

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.200
 or she'd do field recordings of the sound of like

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.240
 one thing she described was a door.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.800
 They just recorded this door for hours

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.240
 and like going through to recordings

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.640
 like every once in a while should hear like a melody

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.480
 come out of it.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.680
 It would just be like from the stuff like

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.640
 through the other side and things like that.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.400
 Just like resonating through the door.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.600
 And that was one of the things that she used to drive

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.720
 like a lot of the songs in the soundtrack was like

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.040
 the snippets that she pulled from this door.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.880
 - That's awesome.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.960
 - It was just like industrial mentality.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.800
 You know what I mean?

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.880
 Like I was like I like that a lot.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.120
 And she's just like seemed super animated

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.800
 and excited to talk about sound.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.960
 You know like the score was just super,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.800
 I don't wanna say melodic or even just atmospheric

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.720
 but just like it was like a cloud of doom

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.240
 that like never went away from throughout the entire series.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.760
 - So in your research as you find out

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.840
 was this like a heavily processed recording

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.080
 for playing cello or was that mostly natural?

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.800
 - I think a lot of it is processed like

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.840
 'cause she was talking about her associate I guess

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.640
 who does a lot of the recording and processing for her.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.280
 I guess it was like heavily processed

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.240
 and so were the field recordings.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.080
 You know what I mean?

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.320
 To the point where a lot of it you can't even tell

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.200
 if it's a cello or a sound of a goddamn

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.040
 pump room door.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.880
 You know what I mean?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.400
 It's just like these strange industrial abstract sounds

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.880
 and just really help convey the like dread.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.720
 - Yeah.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.520
 - You know throughout the entire series.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.920
 - Yeah, I've been wanting to watch that

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.600
 but have been kind of on the fence.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.080
 But I love like the topic of radiation and radioactivity

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.160
 and accidents like that is something I really dig.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.280
 So it's on the playlist for sure.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.280
 - Like I've seen every documentary that I could find

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.760
 on Chernobyl after Fukushima hit.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760
 'Cause it like really piqued my interest in this shit.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.600
 Yeah.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.840
 Especially after I learned that Fukushima

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.680
 was essentially the same type of situation.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.400
 And it was really bizarre because I noticed after watching

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.520
 and even reading things that there was a lot of inconsistencies

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.520
 and not a single documentary all had like the same information.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.560
 It was like a piece here, a piece there

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.720
 and you kind of had to like put it all together.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.680
 And then like this series though did a great job

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.400
 of like collecting all of that

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.240
 and making like one cohesive thing.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.340
 So I was kind of impressed by that.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.520
 But I liked it.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.640
 Nice.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.000
 Great sound.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.400
 - Well, I saw on your list, I cried.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.320
 - My list.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.160
 - You hate you don't like your list?

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.440
 - I don't.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.560
 - What don't you like about it?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.000
 It's your list, you could have changed it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.720
 - Yeah, bad list.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.680
 Just been a shit summer so far.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.480
 I haven't had a chance to really dive into

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.960
 a lot of the stuff that I've gotten recently.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.960
 - I've been digging the new Bug brand, DRM2,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.800
 which I picked up.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.720
 - Oh yeah.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.280
 - So yeah, Bug brand DRM2.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.440
 I've been trying to get one of those since they came out

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.080
 like last summer or like late fall.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.080
 You know with Bug brand, he kind of doesn't want off

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.520
 and he won't announce or generally email people

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.280
 and he'll just like put it in the store

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.520
 just to be fair to everybody.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.880
 So you gotta kind of like check it or write a script

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.720
 to check the site, do something like that.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.080
 Which I didn't do, I just checked it one day.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.440
 And I saw, one was up there.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.840
 I was like, holy shit, mom's up there.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.320
 I saw it's like pretty damn pricey.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.920
 I couldn't just buy it outright really.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.600
 So I took my DRM1X, like flipped it on Muff's

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.640
 in like 20 minutes to the guy who puts on movement,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.000
 the Paxahau guy.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.080
 Like he's the guy who bought it of all people.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.320
 Just thought that was interesting.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.560
 But managed to make the purchase

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.680
 and then next week had the DRM2.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.120
 Main difference with the DRM2 between the DRM1.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.280
 - Wait, wait.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.120
 - Kind of erupt.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.320
 - I'm gonna interrupt on behalf of the listeners.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.880
 Can you explain both of those?

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.560
 - That's a good thing.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.160
 So the Bug brand DRM stands for drum synth basically.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.440
 So his intention is to be an analog drum synth.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.400
 And he claims it's one of the most full featured

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.000
 analog drum synths ever.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.480
 And I would kind of agree with that to an extent.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.440
 It's got a lot of CVIO.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.560
 It's got some onboard modules called like a bend envelope.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.040
 Kind of like imagine a 909 style, turn the pitch up

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.600
 and it gets a little swackier kind of like

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.280
 exponential curve you can add to things.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.040
 But it's got a all banana jack patch points on it too.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.480
 So it's like a desktop module like Bug brand makes.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.880
 He makes modules but also like these desktop things.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.360
 They're still basically a module.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.840
 The main difference is that this one is truly subtractive.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.840
 So the DRM1 I originally had with an expander

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.160
 it was actually a drum synth plus a filter

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.920
 that was also self oscillating

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.480
 that would make like noise sounds and shit like that.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.440
 And this one is different.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.160
 It's actually oscillator into the filter.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.760
 So it's more of a true synthesizer

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.600
 with only decay envelopes though.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.560
 So it's kind of limiting in that you don't get attack

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.200
 and it's really like snappy.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.040
 Like really great drum sounds.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.960
 - It has to be snappy.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.800
 - Yeah.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.000
 The cool thing is you could override all that.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.080
 Amplifier and filter with external envelope.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.320
 So I've been running two Zadar envelopes into it

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.920
 and it's like oh man.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.080
 I've been down the rabbit hole.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.720
 Like I set up this a kind of sold a bunch of Euro stuff

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.600
 and set up a really small lunch box with just modulators

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.200
 all going into the DRM and I'll take a MIDI

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.120
 from my MIDI box sequencer.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.720
 And it's been like holy shit.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.040
 And I don't know that guy is like Tom Bugs,

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.960
 magic filter creator.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.680
 It's the coolest filter I've ever heard.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.000
 It sounds like true electricity kind of very different

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.120
 than what I'm used to hearing from my Euro system.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.000
 So I don't know, I've been digging it.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.600
 I've been using it more as like a bass and lead synth

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.200
 than drums even made a whole rack of samples from it

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.040
 that I've been using.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.120
 But man, I'm super satisfied with that.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.760
 I like the sound a lot more than the original one.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.560
 It was funny cause I think he almost got upset at me

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.760
 for selling the original one.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.400
 He's like, but that's so rare.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.520
 They're so hard to get.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.360
 - I work so hard.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.280
 - Yeah, I don't really care dude.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.720
 I sold it for pretty much what I paid for it actually.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.120
 That's why it went so quickly.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.200
 But people had similar words when I was sold the Weevil.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.040
 - Yeah.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.880
 - Including him.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.040
 Yeah, he was kind of like,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.880
 "Eh."

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.600
 I was just like, "It's not that I don't like it,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.520
 but it's like, I'm expanding my modular.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.600
 I don't really need the Weevil."

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.240
 - Also the DRM2 was like $820 all said and done

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.440
 from like the pound to dollar conversion

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.480
 and the shipping which is like 60 bucks from the UK generally.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.200
 So it's like, I can't just like, something's got to give here.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.000
 So luckily flipped that and it was only like an extra hundred bucks

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.720
 on top and it's super, super happy with it.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.240
 It's been very inspiring instrument.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.080
 Digging it.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.240
 Especially with some external envelopes

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.480
 and I love that he added that.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.600
 So it's like a full synth.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.320
 Like the only thing that's missing is like pulse width

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.920
 and like a sine wave.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.160
 It's like sawtooth to square and you can kind of change.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.920
 There's a knob to kind of change through that shape

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.120
 whereas the other one had just like square out, saw out,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.800
 whatever that you could patch.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.360
 So there are less patch points in some sense

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.520
 but more flexibility.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.920
 But the CV over the filter is just like,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.760
 I just, it's one of those things where I sit there

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.440
 and I kind of scream when I use it.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.160
 Where it's like, "Ah, fuck."

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.240
 You know, I haven't like had that in a minute.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.200
 - How do you get the CV in there?

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.880
 'Cause it's like old banana, right?

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.720
 - It's old banana.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.120
 So I got this little converter box

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.080
 which is eighth inch and quarter inch

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.920
 of banana jacks that I got from like perfect circuit

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.840
 or something years ago.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.360
 So there's a ground jack in the back

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.880
 that's banana that you connect to the ground

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.560
 on the converter box and then it's just perfect.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.800
 It works great.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.560
 So I've got this little station where it's those modulators,

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.680
 the bug brand and then the mini-log XD is above it

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.360
 and the two CV outs are going in there.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.920
 So it's like this little kind of small matrix of CV

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.240
 going across these three instruments basically

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.680
 and it's like, it's kicking ass right now.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.880
 - I was gonna ask, is that a candidate for a live setup?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.240
 - Good question.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.080
 I don't know.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.280
 It could be 'cause it's so simple

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.880
 and it's one of those things where you can be like,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.440
 "All right, yeah, I know what I'm gonna get from this.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.720
 "It's not very confusing or deep."

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.280
 So it could be for sure.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.920
 And it's actually super tempting and I'm not gonna do it

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.720
 but there's the modular, bug brand modular

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.280
 single frame is up there right now.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.200
 Those are equally rare as the DRM and like,

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.880
 but it's like 1600 bucks.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.480
 But it's a full featured dual of everything

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.480
 in three oscillator system.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.560
 It's actually pretty good for 1600 bucks

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.200
 in the sound quality, but right.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.040
 I think the DRM too is kind of enough for my purposes.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.920
 I'm super glad I took the leap 'cause that day

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.560
 I was like, "Hey, you're just being ridiculous."

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.840
 But especially over like TR8S

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.200
 which I think I might flip that again

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.600
 and like shit, that's kind of boring.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.080
 You can spice it up with the EQ pretty well.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.880
 - I was actually thinking about rebounding.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.840
 (laughing)

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.880
 - You know what's going for a high price right now?

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.120
 So I was like, having a moment and I was like,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.360
 "I want the little baby 909, the TR09."

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.680
 Those are like 700 bucks new now

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.040
 'cause they're discontinued and even the used ones

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.600
 are like 100 bucks. - How are they discontinued

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.440
 already?

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.280
 - Like they just came out. - That's like 808s.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.360
 - Not, but the 909 one is.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.560
 - Why? - I don't know.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.400
 - The fuck?

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.240
 - But it's like driving the price up like fucking mad.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.680
 - I remember that being unveiled at knobcon.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.200
 - Yeah, just like two years ago?

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.040
 - Three years ago, three years ago.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:45.880
 - Maybe three?

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.600
 How the fuck do you discontinue something

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.480
 that was obviously widely successful?

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.920
 - They did that with all the first boutique shit.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.840
 - Yeah, yeah, that's stupid.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.440
 - But the 808 still, you can buy.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.880
 'Cause I was gonna go to pianos and stuff.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.320
 I would go there and lunch sometimes

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.160
 just because I'm like,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.320
 "They're just gonna go fuck with some stuff.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.120
 I know all the stuff, whatever."

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.200
 They had the 808 there and they had the TR09 sign

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.040
 for like list price.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.480
 I'm like, "Oh, you got it.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.280
 I got discontinued now."

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.680
 All right, you got sign up, but cool, cool, cool.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.520
 And I went checking on eBay and Reverb

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.000
 and it was just like 600 bucks, 700 bucks for a new one.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.680
 - Fuck, that's a close to it and I don't know

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.760
 and used to cost.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.600
 - Really?

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.840
 - So you wanna get into the convention of knobs?

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.040
 - I mean, yeah, we paid the entry fee.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:32.880
 We're gonna get into it.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.880
 - So, I don't remember if it was last year or the year before,

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.640
 but remember we showed up

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.280
 and they didn't have my registration info.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.600
 And then like after having three very patient

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.280
 and nice old ladies digging through

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.760
 all this stacks of paperwork

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.480
 determined that, "Oh, I've simply forgot to register.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.920
 I don't know how or why."

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.280
 I almost did the same thing this year.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.680
 I registered today because I realized,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.600
 "Oh, I forgot."

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.280
 Because the day that you said, "Hey, you know,

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.680
 hotel's booked, register, you know, get it cheap."

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.520
 And I was like, "Yeah, I'll do that."

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.840
 And I was like, "Oh, but first I need to make sure

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.400
 I can take off that Friday."

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.720
 So I put in the PTO request and it got approved

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.880
 like that day, but I totally forgot.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.760
 Like I thought, "Yeah, I already registered."

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.160
 And I didn't.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.520
 So I double checked today.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.280
 I was like, "You know what?

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.800
 I'm gonna look in my email and look for the receipt."

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.240
 And sure enough, there's no fucking receipt.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.040
 I was like, "I didn't register, so I did it real quick,

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.280
 so I'm good to go now."

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.240
 - That would have been amazing if you went into the same thing.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.880
 - I'd have felt like such a fucking jackass.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.640
 - And those poor women are like, "Oh, it's this guy."

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.640
 - "Is this moron again trying to get in for free?"

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.480
 - All right, great.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.120
 - Tell us that they forgot the registration.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.680
 - We know you're a 10-gug wigler,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.080
 but you can't get in for free.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.520
 (laughing)

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.280
 But it should be all good now.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.360
 We'll see.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.920
 - So I'd like that the guest is

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.840
 chounding the inventor of FM.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.520
 No, and I like that we don't have to go to the banquet at all

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.720
 to see him give a talk about FM synthesis

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.880
 so like advanced techniques,

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.560
 which I think will be like super interesting.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.600
 It would be interesting to see this year.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.360
 Because in some ways I think

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.320
 your Iraq has peaked.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.480
 We talked about this last year.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.160
 I wonder if it will.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.400
 It's shit collapsing now.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.240
 I know it's been much harder to sell stuff.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.080
 I don't know if that's a good indicator.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.280
 There's still just volumes of new stuff coming out,

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.680
 but is it like it used to be?

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.520
 I don't know.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.960
 - I'm curious. - For saturation.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.680
 - Oh, very oversaturated.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.160
 - Whenever we talked about this in the past too,

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.440
 of like the idea of a lot of the simple stuff,

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.320
 there's a thousand variations of, right?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.800
 I still think there's a lot of room for novelty

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.920
 and I think there are still novel stuff coming out.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.720
 I just think the sort of entry point

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.240
 if you wanna make a mark is higher.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.960
 I'll make a risky statement.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.000
 I think, I don't even know.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.520
 I was thinking about this before the show.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.560
 I don't know if your Iraq is a good platform

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.680
 for analog audio synthesis.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.400
 I think it is excellent platform

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.520
 for digital audio synthesis and everything around that.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.600
 And I think that's what it's kind of converging on.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.240
 - Dude, I kind of came to that own conclusion

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.640
 for myself a few years back.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.120
 And like when I was building shit,

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.280
 I think you guys probably noticed.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.440
 I sold pretty much everything except

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.080
 for a few filters that were analog.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.840
 I wanted to keep everything in there digital.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.640
 'Cause I realized that was kind of

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.240
 the strong point of modular.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.840
 Like you can get cheap analog desktop synths

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.560
 and things like that.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.880
 There are diamond dozen at this point,

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.640
 but when it comes to modular, it's expensive

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.920
 and it offers some really unique shit

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.480
 in the world of digital stuff.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.560
 So that's kind of where I've been keeping my rig

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.360
 between the rolling stuff and the corg stuff

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.360
 and the oratoria stuff.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.120
 - You can get all your analog needs covered

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.440
 and you don't need to pay the exorbitant prices

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.280
 of your own rack.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.120
 - Yeah.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.760
 - Yeah, at least that's what I've come to notice.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.480
 - No, but people are still cranking out stuff like,

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.400
 oh, this is an analog for us.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.000
 I was like, I don't care.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.640
 Like I'm not paying $400 for another basic one oscillator

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.440
 module 'cause it's analog.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.800
 Don't give a shit.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.640
 - Right.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.720
 - How many complex analog oscillators can you actually make

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.560
 at the end of the day?

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.000
 Like there's only so much.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.160
 I mean, people come up with shit, but.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.320
 - I mean, that's my list of things that I want to check out

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.960
 at knob con though, is that mind phaser?

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.320
 - A lot of the stuff I want to check out

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.440
 is from the Duschall Music Electronics.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.720
 He's got a whole slew of stuff that hopefully

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.840
 will be at knob con, all digital.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.760
 You know, he's got the, he's hinting at the granular thing

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.720
 that he's been working on.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.560
 - I saw that.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.320
 - Quite a while, the new, what's the name of the filter?

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.160
 - Not Kermit.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.400
 - Kermit's the Bionic Blaster.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.240
 - Thank you.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.480
 Bionic Blaster, he's got the new version of that.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.480
 It's a dual digital filter and the demo so far

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.960
 sound pretty cool.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.000
 But I want to get some hands on time with it.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.360
 The Andor Jr.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.840
 - Is that the single Andor?

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.680
 - Yeah.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.680
 - 'Cause he's had a prototype of that for a while.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.640
 And like you'll see it like whenever he does talks

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.480
 and stuff like that.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.840
 I love the double Andor or Andragus is how he calls it.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.120
 Like whenever he's talking about it, he calls it Andre.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:06.960
 - Does he?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.840
 - Yeah, that's the technical, but I would still call it

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.680
 the Andor.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.520
 - I call it the Andor too.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.360
 - Yeah.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.320
 - I just visualize final flight every time I read.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.800
 - Uh huh.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.480
 - The idea of having like the single version of that

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.440
 and fixing the bugs and all the problems in that first one.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.480
 I got rid of my double Andor.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.360
 I can see getting the single one in a heartbeat.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.200
 - Yeah.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.040
 - I kind of miss it.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.880
 I mean the Zadar replaced it with a crazy digital envelope

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.720
 shapes.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.720
 I still miss just that grit.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.560
 - Yeah, so.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.400
 - Yeah.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.800
 - And I still wanna get more hands on time

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.640
 with the new Hertz donut.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.880
 The Mark III.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.800
 And maybe the piston hot number.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.840
 - Did you get, you had the piston for a little?

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.960
 - I had the Mark IIs, yeah.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.600
 - Oh the Mark II, that's right.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.360
 - But yeah, it's like almost all digital, you know.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.920
 At least on my list.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.000
 That wasn't intentional really.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.800
 It's just stuff that caught my attention.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.840
 - I would say I think it's a good platform

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.840
 for analog video synthesis because that is not,

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.800
 there's no equivalent.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.360
 You can't get like analog video shit.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.040
 So I think it's cool that that market's been able to expand

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.680
 like through the Euro rack, like just structure.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.280
 - Yeah, and being able to take advantage

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.480
 of all of the stuff you already have

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.320
 in your rack for audio things.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.000
 Not having to re-buy that or buy something

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.240
 that is duplicating that functionality.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.120
 - On a similar note to that, I don't know

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.200
 if you guys noticed, but I did not see LZX on the list.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.040
 - Yeah, I saw that.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.480
 Like I really wanna check out,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.960
 they just released the Fortress module.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.960
 - Yeah, I wanna see that too.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.400
 - I wanna see that in action.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.200
 - Also open for another panel also.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.960
 You know, like hearing them talk about stuff.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.800
 - Oh fuck it, that was so interesting.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.960
 - That was our highlight, yeah, last year.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.760
 But that was like the beginners course.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.720
 This hoping would have had like a more advanced panel

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.720
 this year or something, but yeah,

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.800
 I didn't see their name anywhere.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.240
 So might not be there, yeah.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.920
 - I would say through the beginners course again,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.720
 'cause I have a little more context now,

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.080
 or something forgotten a lot of it,

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.480
 but I know I'm like, actually like,

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.680
 maybe I'll get a video like,

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.600
 I don't wanna dip my toes in a little further.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.920
 Now I understand we were talking about the staircase

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.480
 like a week ago, and now I'm like,

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.560
 no, I painfully know like why I want that now.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.240
 - When I first started getting into it,

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.840
 it kept coming up as like,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.720
 like if you've already got a UREX system,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.240
 this is the thing you wanna get,

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.040
 like this individual cortex.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.120
 And I read it and I'm just like,

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.800
 I don't know why I need this,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.800
 but then fucking around with it for like a year or so now,

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.040
 like it makes perfect sense to me.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.640
 It's in every video patch I do,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.640
 like it's just like, it's super intuitive.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.920
 And it's, I mean,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.080
 I know we're gonna talk about structure at some point,

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.000
 but that in of itself is also just fucking mind blowing.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.480
 And then I was also taking the two outputs,

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.080
 putting them into the A and B in the Fluxus duo.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.240
 - Oh yeah, that post you, that looked delicious.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.920
 - Yeah. - Which is kind of like

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.960
 vibrating.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.640
 - So jealous.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.320
 You know there was a time when you were the only person

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.440
 who had UREX video shit.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.640
 We all had to come over here.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.640
 (laughing)

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.480
 - That's true.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.320
 - And we said, oh man, that looks awesome.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.000
 And you were like, oh, just a video shit.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.360
 Like you weren't even watching it anymore.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.120
 - And with the UREX audio back in the days

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.800
 of the Freakin' Steiner and all that other shit,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.000
 which seems like a lifetime ago now.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.160
 - Wouldn't mind having a Freakin' Steiner again, honestly.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.000
 - Yeah.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.160
 - It's good filter.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.880
 - Started it all for me at least.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.720
 - Yeah, it's really good.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.840
 - It's a terrarium.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.120
 - It was the AFG.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.560
 - Yeah, AFG.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.800
 - Yeah, I bought them both at the same time.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.840
 I had a little doffer, you know,

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.600
 a economic case thing that I got.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.040
 The bare bones and I got the Freakin' Steiner

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.400
 and the AFG together.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.000
 Like I didn't even have like a VCA or anything yet.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.840
 I didn't even care, you know what I mean?

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.360
 I was just patching that to the filter

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.720
 and I was like, this is some God tier sounding stuff.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.560
 (laughing)

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.400
 - Yeah, 'cause remember that?

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.960
 The first Intel-Jell module was actually the expander

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.480
 for the Balkan module later.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.040
 That was the first shit that Intel-Jell ever did before.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.800
 I had that shit on pre-order too.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.680
 I was very stoked for that one.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.160
 Crazy to think about how far Intel-Jell has come from that,

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.080
 dude. - Yeah.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.080
 - Yeah.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.200
 Those palette cases look pretty dope.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.040
 They're tiny, but you know, it's a nice little setup.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.440
 - Still have lids though.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.280
 - They don't, that's a big, like, I read that today.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.640
 I was like, oh, maybe I'll, you know,

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.120
 oh, no, they don't have fuckin' lids, fuck that.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:18.960
 How do they not think about it?

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.360
 They could sell people another thing, you know?

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.840
 - Yeah. - Like put a lid on it.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.680
 - Yeah, maybe.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.680
 - Maybe they're trying to upsell you

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.440
 to the big one that has a lid.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.280
 - Yeah.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.120
 (laughing)

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.680
 - It's portability as you're saying.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.240
 (laughing)

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.200
 It'd be nice to see them in the op-con.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.360
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.120
 - Big-ass rig of Intel-Jell stuff.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.600
 There wasn't a whole lot of modular manufacturers

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.520
 on the list to be on it.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.960
 There was a lot of the same, like, other people, you know,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.720
 Yamaha, Electron, all that shit.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.800
 And I'm like, okay, that's cool.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.720
 Oh, and real fake knobs.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.480
 Yeah, I know we're all excited for that again, right?

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.720
 (laughing)

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.200
 - Yeah.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.280
 - How could you forget that?

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.280
 That was the number one thing?

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.200
 Yeah, no.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.000
 - It's ridiculous.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.680
 - What a waste of fucking space.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.120
 So, there seems to be some gimmicky stuff like that on there.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.760
 Like, like utility stuff.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.800
 And I'm like, okay, that's cool,

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.200
 but that's not something I need to see at a convention.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.160
 To get a feel for it, you know what I mean?

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.080
 Like, I know what the fuck a fake knob is, thanks.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.760
 But yeah, I'd like to see more of the big name,

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.760
 modular people on there,

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.640
 but there just doesn't seem to be on.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:32.640
 I saw that, I might be saying it wrong, but Neo, NIO.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.840
 - I don't know how you say that.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.680
 - Me either.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.520
 - I would miss Neo.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.560
 - But they're on the list again.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.160
 They were last year, but they had no show.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.920
 - Which was a bummer,

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.840
 'cause I wanted to check out the analog core four.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.040
 - I wanna hear that too.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.040
 - If it's there, I'll be spending some time with it for sure.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.920
 - I don't hear Barringer is gonna be there.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.480
 - Yeah, after talking about the little TR-909,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.200
 it does beg the question of when they're gonna do

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.960
 the Barringer 909.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.160
 - It's supposed to be soon.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160
 - It's supposed to be.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.080
 The 808's actually shipping now.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.720
 - It shipped that on 808 day on August 8th.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.280
 It's in route to retailers.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.800
 Did either of you pre-order one or anything?

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.120
 - I wanna play with one at KnobCon

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.640
 before I spend any money on it,

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.080
 but I was a little disappointed,

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.240
 'cause the price was rumored up until this point to be $2.99.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.800
 - Now they're saying $3.49.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.640
 - That's not too bad.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.560
 - It's not too bad, but it takes it over to that $300 mark,

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.080
 which was making it stand out more in my mind,

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.720
 'cause that's undercutting all the competition.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.560
 You know what I mean?

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:39.520
 I don't even think you can get a drum-brute impact

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.880
 for under 300, can you?

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.800
 - Yeah, we don't think so.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.720
 - I mean, my main thing is,

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.080
 808 is not something I lost after.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.520
 To me, you start with a 909,

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.800
 and then you put it through distortion.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.600
 - I'm under the same boat,

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.720
 909 is my own personal favorite,

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.640
 but I do like the mix and match sounds here and there.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.360
 Whenever I had the TR8 or the TR8,

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.320
 I usually had a mix there of 909 808 shit.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.160
 You know what I mean?

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.920
 But for under 300 bucks with what you're getting,

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.120
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.280
 - I would pick one up just for the fuck of it.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.440
 You know, if nothing else,

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.800
 like it's got some good features.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.880
 I jotted down 64-step sequencer right off the bat.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.520
 You got individual output for each drum voice.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.800
 You got internal effects.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.920
 You have fucking parameter locking.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.640
 - I didn't know that.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.480
 - So how does that work?

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.000
 Is there a screen for it,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.320
 or like how do you know something as well?

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.160
 - There's a little,

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.240
 'cause I think it's a two-line LCD

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.560
 under the main shit right above the step sequencer.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.200
 At least I'm assuming it's parameter locking.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.680
 I saw on there that you can record

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.720
 like the filter or some shit.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.080
 It says parameter chaining,

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.920
 which I'm guessing is parameter locking.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.720
 They probably just can't say parameter locking,

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.280
 'cause like you're chaining the movement.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.040
 - Also filter, obviously.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.160
 - Yeah, high pass and low pass, yeah.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.080
 Variable mode.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:05.960
 - That's a lot of shit.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.800
 - Right.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.640
 - Yeah.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.240
 - It's kind of hard to scoff at, you know?

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.160
 - I love my 808.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.480
 But it's all about processing the individual outs

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.320
 with effects.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.160
 - Yeah, sure.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.160
 - I think that's a great,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.720
 and it helps you integrate,

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.160
 if you already have a modular,

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.400
 you know, like if you have 350 bucks a burn,

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.040
 are you going to buy one fucking drum module

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.320
 that is a 808 emulation with no CV ability?

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.360
 Or are you gonna buy a whole fucking machine

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.920
 at this point with, you know, all those features?

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.040
 - Cost is one of them,

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.400
 been the big reason why I've not gone down the path

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.640
 of making a modular drum machine.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.480
 - Yeah, it's not--

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.320
 - Don't go down, yeah.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.320
 - It's so fucking--

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.680
 - Take it for some reason.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.120
 - Fuckin' try it.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.380
 Multiple times.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.200
 Many different iterations.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.240
 - Yeah, I would not,

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.400
 much rather get something special with the individual outs,

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.840
 'cause the little critique ones didn't, did it?

00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.520
 - No, they have a single eight inch stereo out,

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.200
 which is one of the main downsides of these things.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.960
 - It's turned me, dude.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960
 It's, you know what I mean?

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.720
 Last year when we were there, Barringer was there.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.720
 I didn't even stop the look at the booth.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.560
 You know, like--

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.400
 - Remember, they were late.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.140
 - Oh yeah, I mean, they were jammin' on our way

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.760
 out the door, you know what I mean?

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.760
 And I was just like, I stuck my nose up at it.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.640
 I said fuck, Barringer, I didn't care,

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.120
 but here we are a year later,

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:29.240
 and they've kind of wooed me a little bit.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.600
 I somehow slipped under our radar,

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.120
 but I was looking at it recently.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.080
 Maybe you guys noticed it,

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.480
 but we just never talked about it before,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.080
 but this was news to me.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.880
 M.F.V. just released the Tans Bar Mark II,

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.880
 which looks almost like a mock of the TR-8S.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.440
 - Oh, shit.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.600
 - Yeah, like even every drum voice has a slider.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.040
 It looks fucking great, but the problem is,

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.960
 like nowhere in the United States really has them yet.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.080
 Like most M.F.V. shit, it's kind of hard to get.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.120
 I'm really hoping to see one at KnobCon,

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.800
 but I doubt I will.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.120
 - Yeah, it looks awesome.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.600
 - Yeah, and it's a combination of,

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.200
 I think it's eight analog voices and eight digital voices.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.960
 - Yeah, little synth voice too, it looks like.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.560
 - Yeah, and it's got a bass line in it.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.600
 I'm like, this is pretty nice.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.440
 - Yeah.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.640
 - And it's not so cheap in the world, but--

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.320
 - But for what you're getting, I remember being like,

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.440
 that's a reasonable price.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.280
 - Yeah.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.520
 - All M.F.V. stuff, I thought was always reasonably priced.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.360
 - Yeah.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.120
 - It is 'cause it's built like garbage.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.680
 - It's like hot glued PCBs and shit, like.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.200
 - Speaking of drone machines though.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.360
 - Oh yeah, what's on there?

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.640
 - I'm on the list.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.280
 - Uh oh.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.120
 - The take a guess.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.760
 - The TSA No Fly list?

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.320
 - No, you're a Pulsar.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.160
 - Yeah.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.240
 - Oh shit.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.960
 - I got my name in the hat.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.280
 I don't know what position--

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.120
 - Doesn't matter.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.160
 - I'm in, but I'm in the line.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.720
 I'm excited for that one.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.160
 I was interested in it, you know, from the start,

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.640
 but the most recent demos that I've seen sold me,

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.720
 and then I have the pipe now,

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.280
 and I'm like, you know what?

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.400
 - I like Vlad.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.800
 - I like the good work.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.800
 - He does good work.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.680
 I like the aesthetic.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.680
 I would gladly accompany my pipe with a Pulsar 23, for sure.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.000
 It looks good, looks compact.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.240
 It's only four voice, but you can do a lot with it

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.120
 due to all the modulation and all the shit

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.040
 that you can do with it.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.160
 - And I don't plan it on using it like a group box.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.880
 You know, I know it's not gonna cover all of my drum duties,

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.760
 but it'll definitely be, I think, a very fun,

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.600
 unique, percussive element, you know?

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.480
 - No, are the four voices different on there?

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.880
 I don't know too much about it.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.760
 Are they like similar versions of the same thing?

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.360
 You know what I mean?

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.200
 - I don't know.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.040
 That's a good question.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.520
 'Cause like the layout looks, like they're all the same,

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.920
 so I don't know if you just have to like,

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.760
 you know, configure it to sound differently

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.560
 or else if it's broken into, I guess,

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.720
 some sort of theme, like bass snare.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.640
 - Yeah, like a Ramona one is like the DRM, you know?

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.720
 Those are like kick snare hat and all of them.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.640
 - Yeah, Ramona looks good by the way too.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.360
 I've been looking into that, the Mark III recently.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.280
 And I was like, you know what?

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.320
 I didn't know that there was a version

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.320
 that came with trigger inputs.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.400
 I thought it was all MIDI.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.800
 I didn't realize that like there's two different versions.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.640
 - I didn't know that.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.520
 - Me either.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.080
 And I saw the trigger input when I was like,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.640
 "Ah, that would be fun."

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.480
 (laughing)

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.160
 It was like, "Shit."

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.640
 And I was listening to demos of it

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.080
 and people were like controlling it with like the Erica drum

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:31.920
 sequencer.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.040
 I was like, "I got one of those.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.800
 That looks fun."

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.480
 But yeah, I don't know.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.240
 I'm holding on.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.680
 I don't wanna really buy any drum machines

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.880
 until I get the policer.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.880
 'Cause there's no definitive date

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.960
 and one that's gonna be out, but he said soon.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.920
 So I wanna make sure I'm prepared

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.240
 at a moment's notice to jump on it.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.680
 - So the only thing you're missing then is the Soma synth.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.640
 - Which I've looked at.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.480
 - Yeah.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.200
 - It's cool, but I have a modular, you know what I mean?

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.480
 Like I can make creepy, drony stuff with that.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.000
 Fine already.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.240
 And I'm kinda using the pipe for that currently now.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.560
 - Oh really?

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.400
 - Yeah.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.160
 - Soma's kinda demo the pipe yet.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.480
 - They're not going to. - They're not going to.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.280
 - I'll talk about it.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.120
 I'll be damned if I let you watch me.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.000
 - Can he gee this shit?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.560
 - Yeah, no, not gonna happen.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.280
 Vlad's a mad scientist, dude.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.360
 Like, I've read pretty much every interview

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.560
 that I've seen him do recently.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.240
 And yeah, he has really interesting shit to say.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.080
 You know what I mean?

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.800
 He seems really passionate about what he's doing.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.720
 He doesn't care if it's normal or not.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.600
 You know what I mean?

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.200
 I was reading, one interview he was talking about

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.160
 like how he built a sampler from scratch back in the 80s.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.600
 And he was all excited about it,

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.480
 only to find out that a sampler already exists.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.960
 He like had no idea that this was a thing.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.800
 You know what I mean?

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.040
 Like, but he created his own version from scratch

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.160
 'cause it was something that he was like,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.080
 you know, it'd be nifty if I could record

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.640
 and program my own fucking sound, you know what I mean?

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.280
 So yeah, he's on another level for sure.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.080
 - But yeah, the pipe dude makes--

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.560
 - Dude, how can you not play this for us?

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.400
 - Yeah.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.240
 - Like I get it.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.240
 - I'll record some chunks.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.520
 - Dude, come on.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.400
 - You know the show--

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.120
 - If you knew the show was on another foot,

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:12.960
 you would definitely be like,

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.800
 dude, you gotta play the pipe.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.160
 - Oh yeah, but I know you wouldn't do it.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.000
 - You know damn well.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.800
 (laughing)

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.240
 - But like, okay, can you at least explain what's going on

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.680
 'cause there's a bunch of these knobs.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.080
 And then there's like a cryptic sort of circle.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:27.920
 - It's very cryptic.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.200
 It's all explained on the side,

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.280
 sort of in a less cryptic way.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.120
 - Yeah.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:37.120
 - It's like a, so the main knob here is the algorithm knob.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.600
 There's 12 different algorithms, okay?

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.680
 And then depending on which algorithm you in

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.240
 changes the functionality of these two contacts up here

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.640
 and each knob, well except for this one,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.840
 this is just volume, but yeah,

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.000
 each of these will do different effects.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 - But yeah, I mean, it's got all kinds of different algorithms.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.440
 There's only two main ones that I've been really using.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.200
 It's the distorted delay in the freezer.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.040
 - Easily.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.520
 - Yeah, it's like freezer basically.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.360
 - Yeah.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.960
 - It's kind of cool and like--

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.360
 - There's one that's a radioactive sign.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.200
 How are you not even--

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.040
 - I forgot when to hold that one.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.280
 It means, yeah, they're all kind of weird.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.000
 I haven't even really been looking at the graphics.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.720
 I've just been like playing it by ear,

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.680
 messing with different stuff.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.320
 But yeah, the two main ones I wrote up in liking the most

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.400
 'cause it's kind of what I had in mind for this was like,

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.760
 to make, you know, textures and drones and such.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.160
 - Does it light up on the front?

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.000
 Like there's--

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.920
 - Yeah, the whole glow white.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.600
 - So these up here, do you have to touch this bar too?

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.440
 - The bottom bar is just for support.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.960
 - Oh, so it's not part of like a body contact combo.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.760
 - These two buttons are a contact.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.360
 The one is like a choke.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:48.800
 - So you can do like interesting rhythmic stuff like that.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.400
 And then the other one changes per algorithm.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.800
 Like on the distort delay mode,

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.680
 this will activate the distortion delay.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.720
 - Ooh, I just noticed, is this right handed?

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.680
 - Yes, or no?

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.960
 Well, yeah, 'cause you hold it with your left

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.600
 and then you adjust the knobs with your right.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.240
 So yeah, big minuses from the two of us.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.400
 - Fail.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.720
 Can you get all that handed?

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.320
 - I don't think so.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.040
 Maybe you can flip the panels though.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.240
 We don't exist.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.120
 - Yeah, I mean, why would you make it for left handed people?

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.200
 They're wrong handed.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.800
 - You might be able to flip the panel, I don't know.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.240
 But it's not the most ergonomic thing

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.520
 even for a right hander.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.360
 - Oh, really?

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.280
 - Yeah, I was talking to Nick about that earlier.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.800
 Like it's heavy and it's like not very--

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.120
 - It's a little heavier than thought it was gonna be.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.720
 - It's heavy and it's awkward and it's wide.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.480
 And people online were complaining that

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.360
 their hands aren't big enough to comfortably hold it

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.440
 for long periods.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.800
 And I read that before I owned one.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.160
 I was like, "Yeah, it's kind of like a lame complaint."

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.640
 And until I got one, I'm like,

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.760
 "Well, I don't really have small hands

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.200
 but it's definitely awkward for me to like,

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.200
 you don't want to be holding it

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.840
 for really more than 20 minutes.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.800
 It's like, get hand cramps and shit."

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.800
 - And you have to hold it.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.680
 It's not like something you could just put on a desk and use.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.720
 - Well, there's a hole there where you can,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.680
 I guess screw it on to a mic stand or something.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.600
 - Oh, sure.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.040
 - But that would still be kind of awkward.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.880
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.200
 - You know.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.000
 - See, it's not something I would,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.040
 I foresee myself like maybe using live

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.840
 or for any extended period of time.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.000
 If I did do it live,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.080
 I would probably just use it in short bursts

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.360
 into like a looper.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.760
 Not gonna be standing there holding it like a,

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.360
 like a blade runner saxophone or something.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.000
 (laughs)

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.880
 It comes with, well, it does come with three,

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.240
 but I got all three that is available for it.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.320
 - Are they different in some way?

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.160
 - Oh, yeah.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.480
 - What do they, what's the deal there?

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.800
 - So this one is the default.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.240
 It's supposed to be pretty versatile,

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:48.240
 very sensitive to like velocity and frequency.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.520
 But they also offered a low frequency one,

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.320
 which is supposed to be mainly to pick up

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.480
 like more base tones and vibration.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.400
 So like, and then there's the high pitch one,

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.160
 which I'm not really sure what you'd be doing with that.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.680
 'Cause I mean, a voice can only get so high.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.680
 So I don't know what the point of that is

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.880
 to pick up really, 'cause I think the default

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.640
 is gonna cover the standard vocal range pretty well.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.480
 You know what I mean?

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.320
 Whereas I can see using like the low frequency one,

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.840
 if you wanna do weird shit, like not exactly,

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.120
 put it to your mouth, but pick up other vibrations

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.520
 or like kick drum or something.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.520
 - Yeah, you know, all kinds of weird shit, I guess,

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.280
 but I got them both just 'cause they're available for it.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.480
 - I wonder if it's like someone who plays a read instrument,

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.760
 maybe you can do cool stuff with it.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.600
 - I don't know.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.080
 See, I used to play a read instrument.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.720
 That's why I kind of liked this.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.440
 Like it was kind of familiar territory.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.240
 I mean, like I used to play sax for a couple of years.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.280
 And it was kind of a reminisce of that,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.440
 but there is no read and you're really not doing anything

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.160
 with air, it's pretty much vibration.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.280
 It's just a contact mic in there.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.080
 So even though it's got a hole in it and stuff

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.440
 and it looks like a saxophone,

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.840
 you're not blowing anything into it.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.280
 It's not really about air control.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.120
 - Right, right.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.080
 So like if I picked this up and I blew into it,

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.440
 what would happen?

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.000
 - It would probably just sound like someone breathing

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.840
 into a microphone.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.920
 - Okay, 'cause that would be my first impulse.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.760
 - Yeah.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.680
 - Like everything about its form factor screams

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.760
 and it's like a throw into this thing.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.600
 - That's the thing.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.000
 Yeah, it's nothing like that.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.560
 But I feel like Vlad nailed it here,

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.760
 especially with the microphone.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.360
 It's just really responsive for that type of shit.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.280
 Like I was going to remind people

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.960
 we're trying other contact mics with it

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.000
 and they were saying the results were kind of shitty.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.840
 - Oh, okay.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.280
 - Like yeah, I guess Vlad spent a lot of time

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.880
 picking and choosing the components

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.800
 to put in this default mic.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.360
 - Also, this was news to me that you played the saxophone.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.440
 - You did not?

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.280
 - When was this?

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.120
 - Like, held for you.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:45.160
 - Ooh, fourth and fifth grade, I think.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.160
 - Were you in a band?

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.000
 - Yeah.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:47.840
 - Very nice.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.680
 Did you enjoy it?

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.520
 - No.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.360
 - No.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.200
 - I wanted to play a guitar.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.480
 - Yeah, I understand.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.520
 - But I got a saxophone.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.360
 Were you good at it?

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.200
 - Fuck no.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.000
 (laughing)

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.240
 I hated it.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.560
 I liked the music and I wanted to learn an instrument

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.480
 but you know, guitar wasn't possible

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:08.920
 and I'm kind of glad 'cause I would have sucked at it anyways.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.200
 Like, later down the line when I tried to play

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.640
 a little bit of guitar, I realized I just don't have

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.080
 the dexterity in these fucking sausage fingers

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:16.920
 to do that shit.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.040
 - I understand the band.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:18.880
 - Yeah.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.840
 Yeah, I used to be able to play a recorder too.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.680
 - Ooh.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.760
 - And read sheet music and sing in the choir

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.600
 and all that shit.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.080
 Don't remember any of it.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:27.920
 (laughing)

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.520
 I'm not a fucking nothing.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.800
 I used to be able to read sheet music,

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.120
 played violin for years.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.360
 - Yeah, nothing.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.200
 - It's gone.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.840
 - Aww, it's crazy.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.560
 - It's so hard for me not to imagine you.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.360
 Like on this like rainy midnight street.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.200
 - Oh yeah.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.640
 - Like on the corner like.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.120
 - Just like singing the blues.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:45.960
 - Yeah.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.120
 (laughing)

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.520
 I ended up getting the Digitome.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.840
 I'm pretty interested in those.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.280
 I don't think I'm gonna get one anytime soon

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.680
 but that thing's really cool.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.840
 - It was an impulse buy.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.680
 - Yeah.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.120
 - You know, I've been keeping an eye on them.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.480
 I love FM drums and there's just like,

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.280
 I don't have anything right now

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:07.160
 aside from like my plats modules to fill that, you know?

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.240
 And so I have to keep an eye on them

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.920
 and I got one pretty,

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.640
 had a good deal on Reverb.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.000
 It was the lowest price that I had seen

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.800
 in like three months for it.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.680
 So it was like, yeah, fuck it, I grabbed it.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.800
 So far I'm digging it as a drum machine

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.880
 but I really need to like put it through its spaces.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.240
 Especially now with the new firmware

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.840
 that just came out like,

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.200
 per track scaling and all that.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.000
 It's kind of exactly what I wanted.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:29.840
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.680
 - You know what I mean?

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.520
 Like, I don't know.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.080
 I need more time with it.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.160
 (laughing)

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.360
 Just not enough time.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.360
 That's kind of why.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.960
 So I sold a bunch of Euro stuff

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.360
 and some of the stuff I liked

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.800
 but I kind of focused on anything

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.120
 that had much depth or menu diving

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.080
 'cause I didn't have much time.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.080
 I would turn on my 7U which I built up

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.800
 and there were like seven OLEDs

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.880
 and the thing that would turn on

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.400
 and there were some times where I was just like,

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.520
 this is just overwhelming right now.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.200
 I'm gonna play some drums and play a synthesizer.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.880
 And as I kind of slimmed it down,

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.880
 I was like, no, you could just focus on

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.640
 what you really need to use.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.280
 I don't wanna start with having to configure something

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.360
 and that's what I felt it was.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.360
 It was like, oh, I'm gonna get these four things

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.160
 into the specific state.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.560
 Like, I love the E3502

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.880
 and I think I'm gonna flip that too

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.480
 just because it's like, I know you can have presets

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.120
 but I just wish it was a little easier to work with sometimes.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.240
 I mean, you flipped yours kind of shortly after Platts.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.840
 - Yeah, for the same reason.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.480
 - It's just way easier to get there faster.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.400
 - Right.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.720
 I like the fact that there was no menu diving

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.320
 or interfacing, you know, the mess with on Platts

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.280
 is you push a button to get into the mode you want.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.120
 You know, it just takes a little bit of muscle memory

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.880
 but, you know, no menu diving and I like that a lot.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.440
 To get to pretty close to the same territory.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.880
 You know, I think the audio quality on the 352

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.880
 is miles above the Platts.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.960
 - Yeah, I agree with that.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.880
 - Yeah, but it serves its purpose for me.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.120
 - He's got something new.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.760
 He's gonna show off in the knob con.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.840
 Yeah, so I'm teasing it.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.200
 Look like he was showing off a new

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.800
 at mega processor on the back of a board of something.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.640
 - Okay.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.560
 - Yeah, that'll be interesting.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.920
 The ER 301 had a really cool update recently.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.880
 He actually kind of went away for a few months

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.760
 and wasn't updating anything and he was like,

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.920
 "Joozy, I just hold on, whatever."

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.480
 And he's got like a log of like what he's gonna work on.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.720
 There's always been this switch on the front of the ER 301

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.120
 called hold that has done nothing for years.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.040
 And people have been knowing that hold mode

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.280
 would eventually come.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.840
 So eventually released hold mode just a couple weeks ago,

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.960
 maybe a month ago or something.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.280
 Anyway, turns out it was really awesome.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.240
 It's kind of like pinning controls

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.240
 and then having control that can kind of sweep

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.560
 and morph through things.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:45.600
 So now you can take all these parameters within your 301,

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.080
 go into hold mode and pin them

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.960
 and then create like other change sets

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.800
 and then kind of like morph through those

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.880
 or like flip between them.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.200
 - It's almost like the parameter log.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.560
 - I was gonna say almost like the opposite

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.560
 of a parameter log.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.520
 - Yep, exactly.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.320
 Yeah, so that's been, I haven't even played with it yet.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.600
 'Cause that's one I, I would likely never get rid

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.640
 of that module but it's one I haven't played with much

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.440
 'cause it's like every time you use it,

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.720
 there are different changes and the core of it's kind

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.680
 of the same now but it's always,

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.000
 every time I turn it on, I feel like,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.680
 well there I need to go to a website

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.000
 and try these five new things or something

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.520
 or just use it really simply and load a sample.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.800
 But the hold mode seems cool.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.320
 Like I'm down with some parameter locking

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.120
 and able to fuck shit up on there.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.960
 - Yeah.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.800
 - That's pretty interesting.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.640
 - That sounds awesome.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.560
 But on the other hand, I saw the on squid sample.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.400
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.240
 - It just came out and it looks pretty intriguing

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.280
 'cause it's kind of the opposite of the 301

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.320
 so it's like all on the panel basically.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.600
 - It's got a little screen but kind of a different thing.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.240
 I wasn't too blown away with the demos I've seen so far.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.240
 - Yes, all in today, before I came over

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.400
 'cause I wanted to check it out.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.240
 - Yeah.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.760
 - Yeah, that kind of took away 'cause at first

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.160
 I was like, "Mm, kind of cool."

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.440
 - Yeah, maybe if it had like more on board effects

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.520
 or something like that, like it has a dedicated button

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.720
 just to downgrade the sample rate.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.920
 - Yeah, I'm like, does that really necessarily,

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.960
 you could have that be something else

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.000
 more important or interesting

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.200
 or just disregard it all together, you know what I mean?

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.120
 I don't know.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.800
 I think everyone at this point has some sort of module

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.160
 in their rig that can already bit crush.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.240
 You know what I mean?

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.240
 - Yeah.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.560
 And for eight samples, it has like three

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.080
 volt proactive inputs and then three CV inputs

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:24.920
 for everything.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.760
 - Right.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.600
 - Ooh, you're gonna have a few that are just static

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.880
 just playing back and sound.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.720
 - Sure.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.560
 - That'd be cool.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.920
 Depending on what you wanna do, but I was like,

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.640
 "Yeah, the thing's gotta have like eight or 16 inputs

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.440
 or something, maybe, really drive it."

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.280
 - Right, right.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.080
 - Or I'd wanna have it or where we would wanna take it.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.160
 - It's like, it's some weird in between

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:48.160
 where it's like, it's not compact enough to be like,

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.160
 you know, this is just my basic sample player.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.360
 And it's not like versatile enough to be like,

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.280
 this is my, you know, sampling super computer.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.600
 Like it's some weird mix in between where like,

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.200
 you're saying like, you don't have control over

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.200
 or everything, you don't have that many options.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.680
 And that screen is so tiny.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.920
 Like you can see the waveform on it, I believe,

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.080
 in some of those demos, but I'm like,

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.520
 and the way the layout is too, like if you notice,

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.080
 the cables kind of have to like overlap the buttons.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.200
 And you also have to like, select which track

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.040
 with a button too.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:21.960
 So you have to like cycle through them.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.920
 Yeah, it's kind of bizarre.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.440
 I was like, this is...

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.280
 - I didn't think about that.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.400
 - Yeah, that's kind of weird.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.600
 - Yeah, I don't know, 'cause I've usually kind of enjoyed

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.720
 his interface.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.560
 - Yeah.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.240
 - You know, on his other modules, but I feel like

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.560
 you kind of missed the mark on this one personally.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.280
 Maybe he'll offer like an expansion at some point,

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.040
 which would be open it up a little bit.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.920
 That would be nicer, but...

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.840
 - This is a preview of our next episode

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.400
 where you're talking about how great it is.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.240
 - Yeah.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.880
 (both laughing)

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.480
 - Oh, speaking of updates, I have another,

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.760
 another thing to talk about related to updates.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.120
 The graphic Fisio update that I alluded to earlier.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.920
 Added drum mode.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.760
 - Oh yeah.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:59.720
 - Yeah, it's real fucking nice.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:04.720
 So the new mode you get into and the FX amount input

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:10.800
 has now been changed to a trigger or a gate.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.840
 Ultimately a single drum voice.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.040
 If you had a bunch of other modules,

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.440
 you could replicate this mode,

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.080
 but it's nice to have everything at once

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.600
 and not have to have a bunch of envelopes coming in

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.440
 and doing this.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.320
 So you have a Tacticay, but you also have,

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.560
 they call FM, but it seems like it's just more pitch,

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.800
 but it's not one-volt proactive.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.840
 But basically you can also then use this envelope

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.680
 to change pitch over time.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.960
 And I think it's an exponential curve,

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.360
 but you have all of the waveforms available to you

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.680
 and you still have the morph control.

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.720
 So you can still send CV to that.

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.800
 You can get like solid what you would expect out

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.760
 of a kick drum sounds and does that fine,

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.880
 but also just weird space punching sound.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.760
 So yeah, I was wrong, I was wrong pressed with it.

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.000
 And there were other bug fixes and stuff in it.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.040
 - There was something else that was added,

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.400
 but it was not as exciting as this new mode.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.520
 - They fixed the fine tune or something.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.360
 - Oh, that was it.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.560
 Thank you, that is exactly it.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.000
 So it was just one knob for pitch

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.240
 and it was relatively coarse.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.600
 But as you were going through,

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.920
 if you went over a note,

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.200
 it would sort of pop up and say,

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.280
 you're now an F, go down.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.800
 And as you were correlating between them.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.800
 So this now you can go, okay, I kind of got near

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.640
 this note that I want.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.040
 You hit the left encoder or the right encoder,

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.880
 pops up and now you can shift

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.280
 how close you want to get to that note

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.600
 that you had in the hit, okay?

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.160
 And now that's the value of it.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:49.440
 So it's a way to tune things quickly on the fly.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.040
 I mean, you still have to dial that in.

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.160
 - I only have one oscillator right now.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.320
 Just the organ, that's it.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.160
 - Really?

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.800
 - Yeah, well I still have the 350 too.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.880
 - Wait, did you get rid of the monsoon too?

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.080
 - No, kept the monsoon.

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.120
 - Okay. - Yep.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.520
 'Cause I've, that's an effects processor.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.360
 They call it a texture synthesizer, but no.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.720
 No one uses it as it's intended.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.560
 (laughs)

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.400
 No one.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.240
 - You got a monsoon's.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.080
 Digging it?

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:14.920
 - Oh, I fucking love it.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:15.760
 - Yeah, that's awesome.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.880
 - 'Cause I played with the clouds before.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.640
 So this is very exciting to have that.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.280
 And then also the parasites from where

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.400
 and fucking around all of that different shit.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.640
 I was getting good sounds in weird fucked up noise sounds,

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.240
 but also just using it a little bit

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.440
 just beefs up something that's otherwise.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.840
 - Yeah, it's also a good way to take a basic mono signal

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:40.560
 and add some stereo depth to some weird panning effects.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.440
 - Speaking of which though,

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.240
 I think I need some kind of stereo mixer

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.080
 for my module and so I was looking--

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.640
 - He started me down that path.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.320
 - I know I could have a long time ago with the ZDSP,

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.280
 but that was like, oh no, I'm getting a good stuff

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:54.120
 out of just the mono.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.160
 This I'm like, oh shit, I think I'm missing.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.800
 Like when I put it into the, directly into this,

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.440
 the lesson right now, I'm like, this sounds fucking great.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.720
 And then going back down to mono,

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.280
 I'm like, it still sounds good, but.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.280
 - Right.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.680
 - Yep, I came to the same conclusion.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.640
 Now most of my rig is stereo.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:12.560
 I have a multitude of stereo mixers in there

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.080
 and stereo effects.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:18.080
 I highly recommend the Erika Drum Stereo Mixer.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.080
 - Oh, okay, 'cause I was looking at that.

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.600
 - Very nice.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.480
 And the new Make Noise one.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.240
 - X, I forget what it's called.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.080
 - X-Pan.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.000
 - X-Pan, that's it, yeah.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.080
 - I saw that one seem more like more than just a mixer.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:31.920
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.080
 - I mean like there's a lot of control over panning

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:33.920
 and things like that.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.280
 - Yeah, crossfading I think.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.080
 But yeah, if you're just looking for something basic

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.480
 and cheap and clean, I highly recommend the Erika one.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.160
 Like I'm enjoying it more than the mix ups

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.360
 from IntelliJil.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.920
 I have three of those in there currently

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.240
 and they're noisy as shit.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.160
 And you only have control over one stereo signal.

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.040
 The other one comes in unintentuated, just full blast.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.400
 - Oh, that's a weird choice.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.240
 - Yeah, it's weird.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.160
 There's two mono inputs,

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:03.200
 but you have volume attenuation control over

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.840
 with the two knobs, first two knobs.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.760
 And then knob three controls your first stereo input

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.240
 and then your second stereo input just is, you know,

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.240
 it is what it is.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.600
 Like you have to attenuate it before it goes in.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.640
 Which is stupid because if you're attenuating everything else,

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.480
 you know what I mean?

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.400
 And to a nice quiet level and then you have this full blast

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.880
 signal coming in, just gonna drown out everything else

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.240
 unless you pre attenuate it.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.600
 So you need like a stereo mixer to go into your stereo mixer.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.680
 - That, wow.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.400
 - Yeah, I don't like it at all.

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.040
 It annoys me and I've been considering just selling my mix ups

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.160
 and getting another Erika because,

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.480
 and also just the noise.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.640
 Like I noticed they're not the cleanest mixers.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.680
 There's some weird noise that comes through through them

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.680
 that I don't get on the Erika's.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.400
 So just my two cents.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.720
 Speaking of stereo signal paths,

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.320
 WMD just released the module that I've been looking for

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.920
 for years now, a dual stereo cross-fader.

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:03.120
 So that, for example, you can take your ZDSP

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.680
 and your monsoon and have the same signal processed

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.720
 in different ways by both.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.720
 And then CV, the cross-fade between them, things like that.

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.400
 - How was that taken until now?

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.760
 - I don't know.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.800
 I know that like since episode one,

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.200
 I've been talking about like,

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.480
 that's the type of module I've been looking for, you know?

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.120
 And I've been looking for one longer than we've been doing this.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.720
 And finally, yeah, someone has made one.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.560
 I don't know why it took so long.

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.560
 - When you start talking about that,

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.080
 I thought you were talking about the autodine.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.360
 - That's mono.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.280
 - It is mono, but when you first started about like

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.520
 a module you were excited for.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.000
 And if it was-- - I was going to be

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.320
 until I saw it was mono.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.160
 - Oh, mono.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.000
 - That pissed me off.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:40.840
 I was like, what the hell?

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.360
 - I have their, what is it, the MSCL?

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.200
 - Yeah, the MSCL.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.040
 - Yeah, the MSCL.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.680
 - Yeah, which is cool, but I was excited about this one too,

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.800
 'cause it seemed like it's kind of like a hands-off approach.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.000
 It just slams the shit out of it.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:51.920
 And I was like, cool.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.320
 You know, I could use one or two of those.

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.640
 And then I looked at it and it's mono only.

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.720
 I'm like, why would you do that?

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.560
 - Yeah.

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.840
 - Like, you already offer like compact, you know,

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.160
 stereo compressors.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.720
 I feel like they should continue down that path.

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:08.720
 But axis, WMD axis spelled A-X, Y-S, dual stereo crop.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.720
 - Y-S, dual stereo crossfader.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:15.640
 You're controlling four different stereo signals

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.840
 in a six HP module.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.680
 - That's nuts.

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.240
 - And it has LEDs to show, you know, signal for all of them.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.080
 It's pretty slick.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:25.920
 - Yeah, that's nice.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.760
 - Like, it kind of exceeds my expectations

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.120
 from what I wanted from a stereo crossfader.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:30.960
 - Yeah.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.080
 - It's compact, it's cheap.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.240
 - So that's meters for each, the left and right

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.080
 for both channels.

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:39.160
 And then what are the two LEDs between them?

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.160
 Is that just the crossfader?

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.640
 - Yeah, that's, is signified.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.800
 Left and right patch.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.640
 - Got it, got it.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:44.480
 - Paying, yeah.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.720
 - And yeah, coming soon.

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.040
 - It's smart.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.040
 - I'm excited about it.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.080
 - It's weird to be excited about something so basic.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:52.920
 - Yeah.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.600
 - I just, there's been so many patches lately

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.880
 where I'm like, I could really benefit

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.080
 from something like this.

00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:57.920
 - Yeah.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.960
 - And just didn't exist really.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.920
 I mean, you could achieve it, you know, using a plethora

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.200
 of other modules, most of which I don't currently own.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.040
 You know what I mean?

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.880
 - Yeah.

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.040
 - But something like, do I really want to take up

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.200
 so much space to achieve something like that?

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.040
 You know what I mean?

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:12.880
 Not really.

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.640
 But here we are in a six HP package.

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:18.000
 Thumbs up to WMD.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.440
 Also speaking of stereo.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:25.200
 A new, well, I don't wanna say a new ZDSP.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.440
 But a, a,

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:30.960
 Ger on Muffwickler recently hinted

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.680
 to a new module.

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.520
 - Mm-hmm.

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.800
 - It's a compact,

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:39.640
 reverb module.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.520
 - Oh.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:44.080
 - That, do you think it's just like the spin

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.600
 with Valhalla, hard-coded on it?

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.520
 - Pretty much.

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.200
 I think that's what it's gonna be.

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.920
 He, he didn't really give a whole lot of info about it,

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:56.760
 but he said it's gonna be released in late summer.

00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:00.440
 It's gonna be a companion module set up similar

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.880
 to his current Echos module.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:03.720
 - Yeah.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.400
 - Which was like the, the compact like delay.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.240
 - Yeah.

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.520
 - It's, the only thing is that kind of

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.600
 didn't blow me away about his description is that

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.600
 it's mono in only stereo out.

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.480
 I'm like, why would, why would you do that?

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.320
 - I had to do that.

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.160
 - Yeah.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.000
 - You know what I mean?

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 Like, that's one of the,

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.200
 fueling parts of the ZDSP is that it was stereo in

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.880
 from the start, you know what I mean?

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.800
 - Well, okay.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.800
 I, all right.

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:25.920
 The way that I used to do things,

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.520
 I routinely just mapped the left and the right

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.760
 with a, with a stack cable.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.600
 - Sure.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.440
 - I'm the same.

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.280
 - I think a lot of them.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.120
 - You do what you gotta do, you know.

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.040
 - Right.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.480
 Nine times out of 10, that's how I would patch this up.

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:39.320
 Maybe they're thinking this is how people use it typically,

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.600
 you know, you're just gonna take this in,

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.520
 you're just gonna malt it over to the right.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:43.360
 - Yeah.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.200
 - Let's just not bother.

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.400
 I'm playing devil's advocate of them going,

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.760
 this is how most people use ZDSP,

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.640
 let's just not bother putting it in a second, Jack.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:54.200
 - He says these cards will have SD cards on the back

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.800
 to update the code.

00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.960
 It's gonna have a 70s algorithm

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.480
 and I guess an 80s algorithm than a 90s algorithm.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.200
 - No, that's absolutely Valhalla then.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.040
 - Yeah.

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.000
 - 'Cause he's got that kind of,

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.600
 he said he'll just work with Tiptop.

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.800
 Yeah, I forget there was another thread

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.040
 where people were trying to get him to ER 301.

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.120
 - That was it, yeah.

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.760
 And like even when he came on,

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.760
 he was like, "Gurt treated me well,

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.440
 "I'm going to only work with them."

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.600
 Still got that, there was like, still pushback.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.480
 - Yeah, I would love a Valhalla, you know,

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.320
 reverb it back.

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.160
 - 'Cause the reverb that's in there,

00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.080
 he used free verb and it kind of sucks, you know.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.680
 It does kind of the trick, but it's terrible.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.440
 (laughing)

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.480
 - But it's just open source.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.960
 I would have done the same thing if I was saying like,

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.760
 "Yeah, I'm not coding that, here you go."

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.480
 Use reverb module.

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.320
 - Yeah.

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.880
 - Yeah, the halls is still my favorite reverb for sure.

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:43.720
 - Yeah.

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:47.240
 - I've been getting more mileage out of the monsoon,

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:49.840
 you know, herb and not herb verb.

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.760
 - These are all a verb.

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:52.600
 - All verb, yeah.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.640
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.600
 - Yeah, it's good, surprisingly.

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.960
 Like I kind of disregarded it for the longest time

00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.720
 'cause I always had halls and I had herb,

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.280
 herb and everything else, so it kind of felt it away side.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:07.760
 But I mean, not that I have three versions of clouds in there.

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.640
 I mean, I've been messing with the reverb more.

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.600
 I recently sold my second ZDSP too,

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:17.040
 'cause like, originally my plan was to do like,

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:22.040
 dual halls setup, but, and I did for a little while.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.360
 - Are you just gonna like, like strum a guitar once

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.960
 and then like two hours later come back?

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.280
 - I liked having the ability to process two different things.

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.120
 - Oh, gosh.

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.400
 - With two different, you know, algorithms going.

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.240
 Not necessarily running through each other

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.000
 for like extra holiness, no.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.480
 - Sorry, that's what I was in front.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.320
 - Yeah.

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:38.160
 - What's thinking?

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.400
 - No, 'cause like sometimes I'd like to have like a short,

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:43.880
 dark verb, you know what I mean,

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.800
 platy type thing going and then something that's like

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.040
 a bit brighter and longer for other elements in a patch,

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:49.880
 you know what I mean?

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.720
 - Oh yeah, don't.

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:53.360
 - But yeah, I sold my second ZDSP and now I'm just kind of

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.840
 making do with the monsoons verb along with my

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.640
 one remaining ZDSP running halls.

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.280
 And Maryana Trench, that's a pretty good card.

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:02.120
 - I haven't gotten that one.

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:02.960
 - I've been getting a homologized.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.680
 - I've been pissing a lot of money on video shit.

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:05.520
 - Yeah.

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.640
 - So I just didn't know necessarily when I would use

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.240
 that over halls.

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:13.440
 - Yeah, it's definitely not a halls replacement

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.880
 but it can do some unique stuff.

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.400
 It has a life of its own kind of like how halls does, you know

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.640
 and it just has a very organic feel to it.

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:25.800
 You can get some interesting weird feedbacky, you know,

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.920
 strange tones out of it.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.200
 In fact, that was running Trench into halls at one point

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.200
 and that was pretty cool.

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.040
 - Mm-hmm.

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.640
 - So you're running your reverb into a reverb?

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.560
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.640
 Like, I don't, it's weird to consider the Trench card

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.680
 like a reverb because I wasn't using it as such.

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.360
 It was more like a, I guess a manger

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.560
 wouldn't be the proper word either

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.040
 but it just helps to transform sound

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.240
 into like strange harmonic content

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:56.360
 and it utilizes CV really nicely.

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.280
 Like the shit that you can hit on there

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.600
 and you can just start morphing things

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:03.320
 into strange, stranger things.

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:04.160
 I don't know.

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.360
 - Yeah, that's cool 'cause actually that would be one thing

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.600
 that I've always said about like ZDSPs.

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.640
 Like I don't end up using a lot of CV.

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.520
 - Right, either have I up until this card.

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.080
 I think it kind of begs for it.

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:19.720
 - Yeah, I got that H9, Eventide H9 pedal module

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.960
 that like won a 10 thing.

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.240
 That was the most cramped module I've ever seen.

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.000
 I almost like laughed when I took it out

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.720
 and like tried to turn one of the knobs.

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:30.520
 It was like, holy shit, this looked so much better on paper.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.240
 Yeah, I had that in the rack for like five minutes

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.320
 and that shit was on reverb.

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.160
 - Oh yeah.

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.240
 - I didn't even know you got one.

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.400
 - Yeah, yeah, I just got it.

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.760
 I was like, kind of drunk maybe when I bought it.

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:42.920
 Yeah, got it.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.200
 I was like, fuck, this is super tiny

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.080
 and it also had like the green at the bottom.

00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.280
 It was like super bright blue and I was just--

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.280
 - Oh, your favorite.

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:53.080
 - Yeah, fucking blue LEDs.

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.520
 - I'm not putting tape on this thing already.

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.160
 And also the idea of having that much CV control

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.400
 was like, I just don't, I don't think this is necessary

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.840
 for a lot of effects, you know?

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:02.680
 And plus the green.

00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:03.840
 - Use the expression pedal input

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.720
 if I really need like a CV control or something.

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.320
 - Yeah, I don't know if I have any interest

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.120
 in his smaller reverb, you know?

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:14.800
 Even if it is running like halls, like algorithms,

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.080
 I don't know.

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.000
 'Cause I can't imagine it would be cheap.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.720
 - The only thing I would be interested in is having,

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.120
 like if it is just halls, taking that out,

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.720
 making it a dedicated halls machine,

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:27.200
 which my ZDSB unfortunately is a lot of the time,

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.440
 honestly I can see myself getting that.

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.800
 - Yeah, it all depends on the price for me, I think.

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:35.600
 I haven't enjoyed a tip-top module in a long time,

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.600
 honestly, I feel like most of the stuff that he's put out,

00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.120
 I give a shot and then I'm just kinda like,

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:40.960
 "Yeah."

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.920
 Like the last thing that I was kind of dug

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:46.200
 was the wave folder, the tip-top fold.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.160
 'Cause it had some interesting tricks, you know what I mean?

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:52.160
 It had like the sub-octave outs and stuff.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.600
 You know, that was a cool trick,

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:55.080
 and it was a really nice module

00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.720
 for like feedback patching and stuff,

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.960
 but at the end of the day, it's not small, you know,

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.520
 and it's kind of a one trick, pony,

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.600
 and the fucking new interfaces on everything.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.360
 It's just so ugly, like, it is just like,

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.200
 - It's terrible.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.800
 - It's like I don't wanna even look at it,

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.080
 let alone use it, I'm just like, oh.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.760
 - And all of them are bigger than they should be,

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.720
 even that like, that oscillator is just like,

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.360
 there's now two HP oscillator.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.200
 - Right.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.480
 - The 3000 is just like, this monster.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.040
 Like everything just seems like it's just like,

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.240
 very rudely sitting on a subway,

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.720
 putting its elbows out and like--

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.040
 - Man-sprit.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.520
 (laughing)

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.080
 I mean, that's everyone's complaint about the ZDSP too,

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.600
 is its size, you know?

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.280
 It's like, it's never really bothered me, 'cause I don't know,

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.240
 I feel like the panel is well utilized for what it can do.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.240
 - Yeah, I can't.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.080
 - You know what I mean?

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.040
 Like maybe you could shave some HP off of it,

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.320
 but I don't know for the most part,

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.800
 I think it's a nice size, but,

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.560
 I mean, hell, I had room for two of them.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.320
 (engine revving)

01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:14.200
 - Speaking of, did you tack what's up with that?

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.040
 Do you have to ship it?

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.400
 - Yeah, so this is a,

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.640
 I don't know, did I talk about my problems with this

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.800
 in the past with--

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.320
 - I think briefly, I mean,

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.000
 I think there's at least a five minutes section

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.760
 in every episode where we complain about

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.200
 electrons, some agree.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.200
 (laughing)

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.560
 - So one of them was probably me explaining the problems

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.680
 I was having with it, just not turning on.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.760
 And there's some back and forth with the support,

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.880
 and you know, they're like, it's a capacitor,

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.880
 and if you do certain things,

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.200
 it takes a long time to empty.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.400
 So you guys sit down and wait,

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.760
 and they were talking only a bit of like minutes,

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.760
 but it was taking like hours

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.280
 for mine to turn back on.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.800
 And then just out of the blue,

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.040
 it started working fine.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.920
 And I even was like, okay, I guess that was it.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.000
 It's working fine again, thanks.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.440
 Three months went by, and I used to, you know,

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.680
 most days, like, it's a rare day that I don't turn it on

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.040
 and do something with it.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.920
 And it worked when we went down to the beach,

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.880
 had no problems down there.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.360
 But a week after that, I come back and gonna turn it on,

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.040
 and it doesn't come back on.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.080
 So I'm like, okay, shit.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.200
 And so I turn it off due to the normal thing.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.560
 Hours later, it's still not fucking turning on.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.520
 And now I'm like, oh shit, I haven't done,

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.440
 I haven't since I've done this in like a month.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.760
 I don't wanna lose that fucking work,

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:34.200
 at least turn back on so I can back this up.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.520
 - You said it.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.360
 - I did, I said it.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.400
 - You said the name.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.320
 - The titular name.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.320
 - The titular name.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.160
 (laughing)

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.000
 - I can take it.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.480
 (laughing)

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.760
 So, so finally, it wasn't until the next fucking day

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.080
 the same turn it's on.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.840
 This is not okay, so I basically hit them back up.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.720
 This happened again, didn't turn back on

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.160
 until the next day.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.920
 I'm like not, like, I basically don't trust this anymore.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.160
 I can't use this, I can't show up and go,

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.800
 oh, hey, drum machine didn't turn on.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.920
 I'm just gonna take these drink tickets and go.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.800
 Like, I need to hit the turn on.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.320
 - And tell your friends.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.720
 - Back next time, maybe my shit'll work.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:15.600
 - And to their credit, they came back and he's like,

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.080
 yeah, this just sounds like this.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.000
 Yeah, just send it back.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.480
 There's something weird going on with their website.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.600
 Basically, he's like, so we have your,

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.520
 for your email address, the registration of the serial number

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.960
 for the digit tech, but there's no address.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.040
 So I log into the website, all I see is an address,

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.480
 no registration for the digit tech.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:37.960
 I'm like, these are the quirky, this is the quirky shit

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.200
 that keeps us talking about electron, dude.

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.520
 - And I'm like, you know, you've got peanut butter

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.840
 in my chocolate, no, you got chocolate in my peanut butter.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.080
 (laughing)

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.160
 So I'm still straining this out,

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.120
 even though it's the exact same email address.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.320
 But I mean, at the very least, they are like, yeah,

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.960
 this isn't right, we're gonna fix it.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.540
 (upbeat music)

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:05.120
 (upbeat music)

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.700
 (upbeat music)

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:30.540
 (upbeat music)

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.280
 (dramatic music)

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:43.280
