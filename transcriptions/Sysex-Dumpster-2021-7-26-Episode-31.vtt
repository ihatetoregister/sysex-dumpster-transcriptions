WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.100
 *music*

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:37.100
 I made a bunch of notes, like usual, because I don't trust my brain track of the shit that I want to talk about.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.100
 Same here.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 There it is.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.100
 I wish that wasn't the case.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 I was like, "Yeah, I just committed the memory and then like, I know my brain will fail."

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 Do you want to start taking those like memory booster things that are almost certainly garbage?

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 Yeah, I've lived into them.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.100
 Oh, really?

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.100
 I don't think anything really works except Adderall.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.100
 No.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 *laughs*

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.100
 Yeah, I never even looked into what I just assumed.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 Like, there's just nothing that's going to help.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.100
 There's a lot of shit that seems to be catering to like the Silicon Valley crowd,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 and all these brain boosters and memory answers and performance enhancers and all just seems like garbage.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.100
 You have tried a few of them. Never noticed any difference.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.100
 I think B vitamins are the most effective thing I've ever had.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.100
 Yep.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 Everything else is kind of like...

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.100
 And if you notice a lot of these have B vitamins, you know what I mean?

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.100
 Yeah.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.100
 Essentially, it's just a way to make people overpay for vitamin B.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:42.100
 Or maybe just like not living in a perpetual state of feeling constantly overwhelmed and stressed out beyond belief would help my memory.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 That's ridiculous.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.100
 That's the thing, dude.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 Like the most proven shit boils down to sleep.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 Mm-hmm.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 Caffeine.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.100
 Vitamin B.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.100
 Adderall.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.100
 That'll boost the shit out of your brain.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.100
 Nothing else will fucking top any of that.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 Oh, Mr. B-Man joining us.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 Got a visitor.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.100
 Hey, buddy.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 What do you have to say about Bheringer?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.100
 Yes, I agree.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.100
 Clones.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.100
 (laughter)

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.100
 I'm mad that we're...

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.100
 Oh, buddy.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.100
 You want me to be a mom?

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.100
 Fading his basement again.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.100
 They say they're just bringing rare stuff back, but then they do an Intelgels quad VCA.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.100
 (laughter)

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.100
 I know, right?

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.100
 I've never got about that already.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.100
 The foreplay?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.100
 Yeah.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.100
 I guess, I mean, we're recording.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.100
 I guess we should just segue into episode 31.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.100
 Well, should we ask...

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.100
 ...some foreplay.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.100
 Bad boys permission?

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.100
 I mean, obviously he's come down here to tell us something.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.100
 One of it may be you have to stop recording.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.100
 You came down here to tell us, "Get the fuck out."

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.100
 Yeah.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.100
 Back again, face to face.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.100
 Yep.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.100
 The second time.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.100
 And a long time.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.100
 For episode 31.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.100
 It's true.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.100
 It's all true.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.100
 Sipping on some green tea, courtesy of Nick.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.100
 Dash of honey.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.100
 A dash of honey?

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.100
 A dash of honey.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.100
 A dash of honey.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.100
 It's the first caffeine that I've drank in years.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.100
 Really?

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.100
 Yes.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.100
 I mean, I guess it's true.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.100
 I know you didn't drink coffee, but I didn't realize there was no caffeine.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.100
 Yeah, I cut it all out a few years back.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.100
 Mm.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.100
 Basically, one of my insomnia was at its peak worst.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.100
 I definitely need to eliminate any possible triggers.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.100
 Yeah.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.100
 So I just eliminated caffeine entirely.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.100
 So your tolerance is real low.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.100
 So your body gets sucked up.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.100
 Extremely locked up.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.100
 I think I'm already buzzing a little.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.100
 Oh, really?

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.100
 Yeah.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.100
 I put an adder all in there when you work.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.100
 Fuck, yeah.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.100
 And some nutraceuticals and brain pills.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.100
 [laughter]

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.100
 So I guess we can point out early on.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.100
 Here, noise in the recording.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.100
 It's because we got the air conditioner running.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.100
 And we're in the middle of a mild heatwave.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.100
 It's hot.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.100
 So it's noisy.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.100
 Tough shit.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.100
 We're hot.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.100
 It's sticky sweet.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.100
 From our head.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.100
 To our feet.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.100
 Exactly.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.100
 Let's go with that.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.100
 She's sipping on there, Dave, with your biodegradable straw.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.100
 That biodegradable straw is already falling apart.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.100
 That's how they do.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.100
 Yeah, this is just cold brew from Big Dog.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.100
 I think I've had that in previous episodes.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.100
 It's still--

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.100
 It's typical Dave go to.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.100
 It is my go to because it is like 700 feet from my house.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.100
 It's very close.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.100
 And I like the--

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.100
 I like the people that work there.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.100
 I like the owner.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.100
 And it's dog friendly, obviously.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.100
 It's a cool place.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.100
 If you're in Pittsburgh, you should check it out.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.100
 But yeah, the biodegradable straw.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.100
 And then you should just move to the sippy cup top that other places have gone with the straw.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.380
 And the mall in favor of the straw, let's try not to make things worse for the environment

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.100
 that we've already fucked up.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.100
 But that is not a good solution.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.100
 No syrup.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.100
 It is still syrup in a sippy cup.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.100
 In a sippy cup.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.100
 Yeah, I had the sippy cup earlier because I got a nice coffee from bitter ends today.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.100
 The sippy cup's the way to go for sure.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.100
 It's definitely much better.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.100
 If I pulled this out, it may actually just break in half at some point.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.100
 That's how bad it is.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.100
 You basically-- the clock is ticking.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.100
 The second they put that into any moisture.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.100
 And I'm long past that point.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.100
 It's not structurally sound anymore.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.100
 It's like doing it through a newspaper at that point.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.100
 But April Machete, at best.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.100
 It's probably as you don't have your own special metal straw.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.100
 That's a good idea.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.340
 What I typically have done is ask them to not put a straw in it whatsoever and just take

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.100
 the lid off when I go to drink it.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.100
 That's unheard of today.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.100
 I mean, I'm a bold pioneer.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.100
 Just drinking out of a cup.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.100
 Yes, yes, it's just crazy.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.100
 Right out of it.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.100
 But I had to drive over here.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.100
 So I was like, "Yeah."

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.100
 And the ice hit your teeth.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.100
 It was cold.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.100
 I was like, "Ahh."

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.100
 Ice on my teeth.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.100
 I've literally never heard anyone have that problem before.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.100
 Just me?

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.100
 Okay.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.100
 You don't like the metal straws there.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.100
 This scare me.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.100
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.100
 Yeah.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.100
 A little terrified.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.100
 I've had that conversation with my sister.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.100
 She's like, "Oh, about them."

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.100
 And I'm like, "Look, when I was a kid, I used to always chew on my pens."

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.100
 Yeah.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.100
 And I had my pen in my mouth.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.100
 And one time I reached down to pick something up and I accidentally need the pen that was

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.100
 in my mouth and stabbed myself into the roof of my mouth.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.100
 Oh my God.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.100
 Oh my God.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.100
 In the top of my mouth.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.100
 You don't realize it, but it's kind of soft up there.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.100
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.100
 Anything metal with a little bit of force can go right up in there.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.100
 It's kind of freaky.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.100
 And then it's real fun to eat for the next two weeks while it heals.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.100
 Yeah, it sucks.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.100
 Should we add a warning or something to this before we get into this part of it?

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.100
 Because that made me like a little lightheaded outgrowth that was.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.380
 Like just the idea of thinking that was like, you puncture it so bad, like your sinuses

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.100
 are drained just like directly into your mouth and like you're going to eat food and like,

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.100
 "No, that's not okay."

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.100
 Oh God, dude.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.100
 Yeah, no.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.100
 Morning we're seeking out metal straw sponsorships.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.100
 Or we were.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.100
 Damn it.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.100
 We blew that one too.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.100
 And I wasn't afraid of metal straws, but now I absolutely am.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.100
 Yeah.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.100
 New nightmare fuel for you.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.100
 I just assumed I'd keep losing them.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.100
 Yeah.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.100
 I would not be able to clean it or I'd do that.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.100
 Yeah, there's a whole bunch of shit about that I don't like.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.100
 Yeah.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.100
 Just give me a sippy cup.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.100
 Yeah.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.100
 Sippy cup.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.100
 Yeah, I'm talking about it.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.100
 There's like the plastic.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.100
 Oh no, yeah, yeah.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.100
 Okay.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100
 I don't want you to imagine.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.100
 I'm just so weird and I'm singing a Melanie Martinez song.

 I don't know who this is.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.100
 I don't know who this is.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.100
 I don't even think you touch the sliders, which is like the new.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.100
 No, well, I guess we could just jump into it, right?

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.100
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.100
 We're kind of.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.100
 That's well.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.860
 I just want to point out though that all of these influencers are basically, they're racing

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.100
 for second place behind us.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.100
 Right, right.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.500
 Now that we're on YouTube and basically dominating, dominating the

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.500
 dominating it.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.100
 Like, yeah, YouTube has never been the same.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.100
 Nope.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.100
 No, I mean that.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.100
 That's what we stuff with in that domain.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.100
 Fucking a game up.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.100
 But yeah, the LXR2.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:25.100
 A digital drum synthesis machine.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:30.100
 It's weird because we recently started talking about this again, even though it's a pretty

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.100
 old mission.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.100
 I think it was a very last episode.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:37.100
 Because I sat on that kit for a million years and then put it together and was like, "Oh,

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.100
 shit, this thing's amazing."

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.100
 And then got the 60 knobs and was like, "This is also amazing."

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:49.100
 So the fact that we've very recently unearthed this due to my laziness and procrastination,

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:53.500
 like it's weird that we just recently started talking about the Mark I and now the Mark II

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.100
 basically out of nowhere.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.100
 Yeah.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:01.100
 The code read before it had been touched in six years, until apparently now.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.100
 That's the thing.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:07.500
 Like this so two versions collaboration between Erica Synths and Sonic potions who put out

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:13.100
 the first one who kind of, I mean, I guess they still exist?

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.100
 They kind of fell off a little.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.100
 They fell off a lot.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.100
 They made some modules, but that kind of peed it off to the open source.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.100
 They never released half the modules that they announced a few hours ago.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.100
 Yeah, a lot of it never came out.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.100
 Penrose came out and maybe the delay or the filter or something.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.100
 I think it might have been the filter.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.100
 I know the reverb never came to be.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.100
 And their shop is routinely down or closed.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.100
 Yeah.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.100
 And even just selling kids and products of their existing stuff fell off pretty hard.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.100
 Yeah.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:47.100
 So I feel like this is more of a adoption than a collaboration.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.100
 We're collaborating by Erica Synths.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.100
 Yeah.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.100
 They're kind of like, "Oh, we're going to scoop this little baby up off the doorstep and

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.100
 give it a good home."

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.100
 And they made the OG metal case for it too.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.100
 Yeah.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.100
 They started off perspex case.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.100
 Yes.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.100
 And Erica made the first metal one, which is what you have.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.100
 That's the one I have.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.100
 What I still have.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.100
 That's what I had as well.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.100
 I did the game for it.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.100
 Yeah.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.100
 I did the transplant when I had mine.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.100
 I took it out of the plexiglass.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:16.100
 And even had the back that was ready for the CV expansion.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.100
 Yeah.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.100
 That was the main reason why I got it.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.100
 Yeah.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.100
 Same.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.100
 I bought the expansion kit.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.100
 And I was like, "Well, if I'm going to bother to make that, it needs to be in a proper case.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.100
 It can accommodate it."

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.100
 So I got the Erica Synths metal case.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:32.100
 But yeah, it looks like they scooped us up.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.100
 They made some enhancements.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.100
 Kind of made it their own thing now.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.100
 Yeah.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.100
 It's smaller.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.100
 And like aesthetically, it looks like their other desktop standalone instruments.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:49.340
 So like if you have like an Erica bass line or Zendele or something, like it's going to

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.100
 look fitting right next to it.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.100
 You know what I mean?

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.100
 It jives with their lineup and their look.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:00.100
 And it kind of looks like it has the basics of the LXR Mark I.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.100
 But it has like the additional row.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:05.100
 And it has those faders per channel.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.100
 Yeah.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.180
 So like that seems like that's a pretty big form factor change as opposed to having this

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.580
 sort of buttons per channel.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.580
 I love sliders on drum machines.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.580
 Oh yeah.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.580
 You know what I mean?

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.580
 Totally.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.580
 The sliders that they added to like the TR8S and the TR8 and all that.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.580
 Yeah.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.580
 I like that vibe.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.580
 It just makes it that much more friendly for performance.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.580
 Absolutely.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:35.060
 The LXR kind of always beg to be used as a performance instrument but it's always kind of too flaky

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.140
 to rely on.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.140
 You know what I mean?

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.420
 Like people have done it.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.420
 You know?

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.420
 Yeah.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.420
 I think you guys have done it.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:47.260
 I mean Morgan do it but I never felt confident enough of mine to use it in a live setting.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.260
 I was expected it to short out.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:53.100
 I always know that that's an option in a way that other gear doesn't necessarily have.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.100
 And that's why I will not take it out.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.780
 Again, even with the 16-obs.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:04.700
 And the 16-obs increased its performance capabilities but like for the volume it still

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.780
 has those tiny little tiny little knobs where like a fader.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.780
 So much more like so much more easy to perform with.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:13.780
 Definitely.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:18.020
 So like now I'm going to preface all of this by saying I was really really tempted by

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:24.420
 the Mark 2 when it first came out was first announced and even after that dodgy video.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.140
 I don't think I'm getting one.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.140
 No?

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.140
 Yeah.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:32.300
 It's not different enough from the Mark 1 and recently they announced that a lot of

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:37.900
 the bug fixes and the new features as they can add to the Mark 2 firmware are going into

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.860
 the Mark 1 firmware.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.980
 So it's kind of fixing some of the problems that I had and it's just not enough new stuff

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:45.980
 for me to go.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.220
 I'm going to get an entirely new one.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:55.660
 And it does seem like the connectivity wise it's less than the Mark 1.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.740
 So I just want to put it out there that like is excited as I am and if I didn't have a

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.620
 Mark 1 I'd probably scoop this up at a heartbeat.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.900
 That's the boat that I'm in.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:03.900
 You know what I mean?

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.660
 I think in our last episode I was even talking about I've been eyeballing an LXR again.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.660
 You know what I mean?

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.460
 I was trying to find one second hand already assembled because I didn't really feel like

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.260
 trying to mess with the kit.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:21.260
 So yeah this is really appealing to me because now I don't have to assemble one.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.140
 I don't have to try to find one second hand.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:28.820
 I can just buy the Mark 2 that's already come preassembled and it's got sliders and

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:29.820
 whole...

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:30.820
 Absolutely.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:35.820
 I thought that I was in.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.820
 If I had basically not bothered to make that kit ever I'd probably just sell the kit and

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:38.820
 go with the Mark 2.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.820
 That was one of the things that was confusing to me about that original video.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.980
 It was getting comments on YouTube and on Facebook where it was posted originally.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.460
 Like people were being like "Oh my god this sounds great."

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.460
 You know what I mean?

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.460
 Things like that.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.460
 And I'm like it sounds identical.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.460
 Yeah it's exactly.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.380
 It's like LXR has been around for like a decade.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.820
 Like the sound engine sounds like as they were scrolling through the presets I think

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.900
 there was only one that seemed like it utilized the delay.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.820
 That was the only preset that sounded unique.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.460
 Everything else was like "Nope" that sounds like an LXR.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.460
 Which is good.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.940
 Like all of you people leaving these comments you can get one right now.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.700
 It's been readily available for ten years.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.620
 You do see the Mark 2 right?

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.820
 That means that there was a Mark 1.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.900
 The Mark 2 implies a Mark 1 just putting it out there.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.620
 Yeah it's appealing to me.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:25.900
 But not because it's like offering any crazy new sonic capabilities.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:31.160
 It's just the fact that it's conveniently already assembled and has a few hardware tweaks like

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160
 sliders and shit.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.660
 Yeah I'm sure they made it all surface mount because the OG is through hole.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.660
 It made it bigger.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.660
 Yeah.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.660
 So they were able to shrink it down a little.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.660
 Bring it back for people who don't want to build one.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.660
 Which is understandable.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.900
 Because even the 60 knobs I don't know.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.700
 You got one of the last kits for that.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:49.260
 I don't like think that's easy to get right now.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.260
 Yeah I don't like so.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.660
 So even when I got it I kind of assumed I'd have trouble finding one.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.260
 So yeah it's not readily available.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.340
 And it adds, I mean the LXR is already pretty big.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.380
 This adds basically the same footprint right beside it.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:07.700
 So between the two of them you know it's a pretty substantial amount of space where Mark

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.740
 2 everything about it smaller.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.540
 Yeah it is a shame they couldn't get the trigger out on it though.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.300
 That's super nice.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:18.100
 And really the gate out it's like there as long as the drum sound is which when you figure

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.180
 that out it's like okay that's pretty cool.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.180
 Yeah it is.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.180
 Totally agree.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.500
 I made a overview list of some of the pros and cons compared to the original.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.100
 Well they had honest.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:32.180
 Well I guess just in case nobody is familiar.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:37.340
 If they haven't ever heard of an LXR or heard our previous episodes before it's a drum machine

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.740
 at its most basic function.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:43.900
 But it's six channels with seven sequencer tracks.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:48.900
 The seventh extra track being dedicated to the open hat.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.140
 It has generative functions, step probability.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.900
 You can generate full sequences at random.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.780
 It's got micro steps.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.860
 It's got parameter locks.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.060
 It's FM.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:10.500
 It's FM and digital but it also has some basic sampling, well sampler capabilities can't

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:16.100
 sample into it but you can play waves that you can layer as transients or just as the

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.780
 track itself.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.700
 The only thing that I know off the top of that is comparable to is the electron machine

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:29.300
 drum which at this point goes for three times the fucking price of an LXR.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:35.180
 It's not uncommon to see machine drums at this point selling for close to three grand.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:41.140
 Whereas the LXR ones sold for like I think the kits were like what 500 bucks.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:46.860
 You can get the mark ones used now since the mark two announcement for under that and the

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:54.060
 mark two is selling retail at $590 USD so under $600 you're getting a pretty fully

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:58.860
 fucking functional digital drum machine.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:05.080
 Plus the per track features you got an LFO per track that you can assign to any other

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.860
 track if you want.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:13.300
 That kind of set the standard for me when I've had my LXR the first time and I've been

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:18.900
 struggling to figure out why manufacturers don't do that on other gear like electron

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.140
 digitac or the digitone.

00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.820
 Like the machine drum did that was the only one who'd arbitrarily assign LFOs and everything

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.780
 after that it was just one per track.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.180
 That was an electron device.

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.140
 You know what I mean?

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:38.340
 What the fuck is this open source LXR device can do that today.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:43.340
 Why the fuck can't you find that on a you know electrons most current gear 10 years

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.340
 later.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:49.140
 I actually just thought of something about the second LXR wonder if they increased the

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.660
 parameter lock memory.

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:54.140
 Because on the first one you can run out real easily.

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:57.420
 Actually you end up overwriting them is what you don't maybe realize at first.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.420
 True.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:02.980
 That's how it was kind of like an electron device where it was almost infinite or more

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:03.980
 than you need.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.540
 That would be a pretty big selling point for me maybe.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:11.020
 I would hope so because they seem to have boosted the sequencing memory at least.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:15.300
 It's up to 64 step now instead of 16 like on the OG.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.580
 It's another nice feature for sure.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:21.220
 That might also come in the firmware update for the Mark 1's.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:25.780
 With the subset and sub sequences per step you could expand that beyond 16.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.780
 True.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:31.100
 So they've always had a little bit more than just the 16 that you get on the surface.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.780
 But there are still limitations to that too.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.900
 How much sub sequencing you could do.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:41.220
 And then like I just have a basic list of the improvements of Mark 2 over Mark 1.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.780
 Sliders.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.780
 No assembly required.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.900
 64 step sequencing.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:52.060
 They've added a delay effect which from what I can tell is global.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.060
 Seems global.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:58.500
 Unfortunately I would be way more excited if that was a per track delay.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.220
 That would be pretty cool.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:06.220
 And from the brief demo I saw of the delay it seems like I can get down into like really

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:10.620
 tight almost car plus strong type territory which is what I was really curious about.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.620
 That's what I wanted to see.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:19.780
 Because that's kind of been something I've been messing with a lot lately on drum sequencing.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:24.940
 It's very tight delays in my feedback path and my overdrive path.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.140
 You know what I mean to add extra texture.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:34.300
 I used to do software a lot back in the day and something I've been getting back into.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:40.980
 Well even with hardware I used to use the old realistic reverb as like a very tight slap

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.620
 back delay/feedback texture in the mix.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.700
 You know what I mean on per channel shit.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:55.500
 So you can't really find many drum machines that have that type of like per track effect.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.380
 You know what I mean.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.100
 And a lot of electron stuff also doesn't have dedicated outs that you can route through

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.460
 pedals to achieve that.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.460
 So it's frustrating.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:09.820
 LXR has four dedicated outputs that you can assign any track to.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.820
 So that's nice.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:11.820
 Very nice.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.060
 And I think I step over most electron shit as well.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.980
 Perfecting.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:22.060
 And then the last pro I have listed there is future proofing.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:28.660
 It doesn't seem to be any reason to doubt that Erika will continue to like keep tabs

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.660
 on this.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:30.660
 You know what I mean.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.660
 And fix any bugs.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.660
 Update firmware.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.580
 Possibly add more features whereas like sonic potions has just been kind of like stale with

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.500
 that for many years.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:45.540
 And then for the cons like Nick pointed out no CV trigger in out panel anymore.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:52.260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, does have the analog clock in out which is nice that they kept

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.260
 that at least.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.380
 It's always I wonder if they're going to fix that because that was always one of the weirdest

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.380
 parts.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.580
 It didn't ever work right for me.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.660
 And I just assumed that was my shitty soldering like I thought I fucked up my expander.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.580
 Even at its best there was one way that I kind of got it to work.

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.580
 But it wasn't something's wrong with it.

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.580
 I remember you pointed that out to me because like I struggle with it for a whole afternoon.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.260
 I'm like what the fuck am I doing wrong?

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.300
 Why can't I sync this right through clock properly?

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.700
 And then you point out you're like no it just doesn't really work man.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.700
 I was like okay.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.260
 Thankfully being late to the game I tried it once.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.620
 I was like maybe it's somehow working for me didn't work.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:32.420
 I'm like okay I'm just I'm just giving up I already knows this problem.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:38.820
 So yeah no no CV panel and it's unclear if Mark two will be available as a kit which

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:39.940
 might be a pretty big con.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.420
 They say it's not.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.420
 Not at all.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.420
 Okay.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.100
 I mean that doesn't really deter me but I'm sure that's going to be a pretty big issue

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.580
 for some people.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:55.100
 And then also unclear if the best L 60 knob companion controller will be compatible in

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.220
 any way with this.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.700
 That'd be a real bummer if they didn't allow that to work.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:05.260
 Especially if they're basing it off the same original 0.37 firmware that does support the

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:11.060
 60 knobs you would think at the it's if you do nothing it's supported.

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.540
 So hopefully that's still there.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.580
 And if it is I mean that and Bastol goes back to actually making them and making them a

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.740
 little bit more readily available.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.900
 And this might be the motivation for them to do it.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:24.100
 Yeah worst case maybe they have to change some of the assignments for CC and you just

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.740
 need to do preset for the 60 knobs I would hope.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:31.940
 Because that's the one thing they did address is the polyphonic MIDI input basically.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.820
 So they added that feature from the B Clark firmware but that's the very thing that broke

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.020
 the 60 knobs compatibility.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:42.140
 So they'll have to make some choices it'll be interesting to see how that works.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.180
 And it's also that B Clark firmware version is pretty old at this point.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.860
 I wonder if it's something else that could have been done.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.860
 Right.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:53.140
 Maybe they just have a new CPU and more you know capability now or something.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:56.500
 So Greg at this point do you think you're going to try to get one?

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.980
 I think absolutely yeah.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.300
 I don't want to pre-order it.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.980
 But it seems like I mean there's already people with the demo units it's out there

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.980
 in the wild a little bit.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.740
 It seems like this is coming up soon.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.180
 During the Erika since they expected to start shipping early August.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.740
 All like the major manufacturers that I've looked at are already accepting orders for

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:20.900
 it like Detroit modular perfect circuit control model that shit.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:25.060
 So and Erica has a pretty good track record for actually delivering on shit that they

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.220
 do put together.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:30.020
 So I want to wait till it's actually released but yeah I think I'll definitely be getting

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.700
 one in the near future.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.700
 Nice.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:37.660
 If I have to sell a couple more things to come up with the funds then I'll do it but I think

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.220
 it's great.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.820
 It looks like great value for the money.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.820
 Yeah.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.780
 And I've been tempted by getting an LXR1 already recently.

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:50.020
 So yeah I think it's kind of like a no brainer for me to scoop one of these up.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.180
 Yeah such a good drum machine.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.180
 Absolutely.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:55.140
 Yeah no use the show of it all the time now.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.540
 Feeding for a Mark 2 right now kind of even though it's ridiculous and goes back on something

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:05.340
 I've said in the past but I really kind of want to mark to rhythm new black one.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.340
 Same.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.620
 It's the sampling feature of it too that's really appealing.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:15.500
 Like here in you and Luke talk about sampling with the tracker and how much fun that is.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.900
 Like there's something that's really appealing just getting a new machine like blank starting

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:24.980
 over sampling a bunch of modular stuff having two of them kind of DJ style like something

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:25.980
 like that.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:30.860
 So I may have sent an email to Electron to see if I can use my past beta testing credentials

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.220
 to get a discount like I have in the past.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:37.340
 And if they do I might do something rash.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:41.300
 That was the only reason why I don't have one right now is that price.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.300
 It's fucking expensive.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.300
 It's crazy.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.300
 $1,700.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.300
 Yeah.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.540
 Wait I thought it was even more than that now.

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.460
 The new black mark teaser you can get them new for $1,700.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.300
 Okay for some reason I was thinking there were like 21.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.020
 People try to I don't know why.

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.020
 Or is that just inflation?

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.020
 I don't think.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.900
 People will try to sell them over like for more than you can get a bunch of sweet water

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.900
 right now.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:02.900
 Okay.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.900
 I'm not sure if I had that.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:08.820
 Yeah okay because I thought I was like I swear I saw it being listed at like 2100 on reverb

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.020
 and stuff like it but that's why it's okay.

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.740
 It's just market inflation for no good reason.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.540
 Because it's for a lot of reasons I didn't want to get one like some of the they're like

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.900
 dedicated bank buttons now instead of the way on the mark one where you switch between

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:27.140
 the top four rows in the bottom four minor shit like the performance control the new one

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.180
 looks pretty good the screen looks nice the individual outs for everything that I have

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:36.260
 stereo pairs that I have on mine that I kind of have to use a weird cable for.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.140
 It's a little shit like that.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.380
 No it's a little shit that makes a big difference you know I mean like especially for something

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.860
 I fucking love that much.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.740
 Yeah I want the new one.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:51.900
 The rhythm was like the last great drum machine that I really loved as well and but it was

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.180
 far from perfect you know I mean like the little tweaks that they added to the mark

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.620
 too I'm like okay those are all things that I was complaining about on the first one.

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:05.140
 I'm glad that they addressed some of those things but yeah I don't know at the same

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:09.340
 time I'm just like holy fuck this is an expensive machine now you know what I mean.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:16.100
 17 that's a little more just file over two G's though I'm like you know it's like that's

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:23.740
 up there with like the fucking Paul Sar yeah yeah and what else that new FM one the the

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:29.460
 motor I think it's what is it the DR two or DR one or something.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:35.140
 Yeah I remember when it's called and like the alpha base like yeah all these drum machines

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:39.020
 it seemed like they're just covering like what you would expect from a modern drum machine

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:45.700
 but like astronomical prices you know I mean like I think it all started with the tempest

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:50.540
 really like yeah that was a pricey machine and it raised the bar but at the same time that

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:55.380
 machine was like justifiably expensive except for machine did a bunch of new interesting

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:59.740
 stuff right same with the machine drum user wave that was like more expensive than my

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:04.420
 first fucking car when I bought that thing it is now oh yeah now they're selling for

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.940
 2300 and up it's really that's the cheapest ones that I found some of them are going for

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:13.140
 three grand and up yeah especially break use away of mark two you're gonna pay like 3000

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:17.860
 probably it's kind of insane to me that's all the more reason why the LXR are so appealing

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:23.780
 right now yeah the mark two because it's like you're not gonna really get anything more

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:29.860
 out of a machine drum use away mark two compared to an LXR you know not five times as much

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:35.420
 based on that price right yeah it's like you know I don't know I think those will sell

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:41.060
 like fucking hotcakes for people who are interested in a machine drum like platform and aren't

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.660
 a like electron purist you know what I mean if they want that functionality and they're

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:50.780
 willing to go with like an off brand you know what I mean like the LXR is kind of like

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:54.340
 no brainer there it does highlight I mean we do this annually but I just don't know what

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:59.020
 the fuck electron is doing yeah it's just like re-release the machine drum make it based

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:03.220
 to like just you know don't even leverage the old code just make a new one that does the

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:08.140
 same thing like I don't know I don't get them that's a gap still there's a lot of people

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:15.060
 listening to be speculating that like they're kind of fuck now with the data line leaving

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.300
 like they might just be a shell of a company that's like I don't know we know to make these

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.900
 things that we already designed exactly what we're saying on forums I was reading like

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:29.380
 there's a lot of speculation on the mod wiggler thread and even on the lecture knots forum

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:33.100
 and shit like that like people were thinking that like there's not going to be anything

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:38.580
 new coming from electron at this point except maybe some other thing that they can slap

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:43.180
 into like a modal that's like I keep wondering like why don't they do like a physical modeling

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:47.740
 one or like any they could make flavors of that that would be interesting yeah I can

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.940
 like use that but I know that sounds like so surface level easy I don't know what tech

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:56.780
 they're really working with there but it's just fucking boring and they used to be like

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:02.020
 yeah very innovative they're making all the monies like I don't get it yeah people still

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.700
 want octet racks people would love a over bridge octet rack and they've been asking

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:13.460
 for 10 years for that like so weird you remember the mark ones getting a little crusty there's

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:18.420
 some glitch with the samples that still happens where it does this weird like aliasing and

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.820
 I can like reset the sound and I don't use sounds on there but you know it's kind of

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:27.020
 like a pretty set for it I had that happen on mine back in the day I was one yeah I kind

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:35.980
 of like I'm annoyed by that what else yeah and thus ends the electron corner I mean it

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:39.540
 wouldn't be an episode if we didn't at least bitch about electron it's been a couple of

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:45.580
 episodes it's been yeah like we were long overdue I let it this out if they give me a

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:55.900
 discount electron is great I even replied to the last email from like two years ago where

00:46:55.900 --> 00:47:00.300
 they gave me the discount on the lid see you remember you did this before because that

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:05.380
 time they were like no we've got a new POS system like that's cool I went to speaking

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:09.540
 of I went to Whitewell yesterday I'll try to get the high static deadlines book which

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.980
 they hadn't stocked before but they had to order and like they had a new point of sale

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.460
 system and it was just like I fucking crushed that system they're like how do we get a

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:21.180
 strange attractor book you know through this and it was like we can just figure it out

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:27.660
 tomorrow is what they planned it on it's okay I'm sorry I broke your system it smashed it

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:36.060
 to pieces congratulations thanks I think so so great what else is on your list go by

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:46.220
 book now yeah I feel like I babbled enough anyone else want to kick off something you

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:51.180
 got the I don't even know how to pronounce it though it's I think it's mosque mosque or

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:56.860
 Moscow or apparently it's Moscow my partner let me know I'm I'm calling the Moscow because

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:02.660
 I just think that's sound analytic yeah W the W yeah the V in the W that seems like a

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:10.300
 and the but I also got the expander for it which is a stink Austin on stank Austin keynote

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:16.020
 Austin keynote maybe look at that world that Austin keynote because the problem is like

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:20.620
 seeing it spelled out like this stank really stands out to me and I want to emphasize that

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:27.980
 stink you know yeah that's that cannot be right but this is the new version of it the

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:36.860
 mark to this is the mark to of their their roto sequencer from Zalk Zalk Zalk Zalk Zalk

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:43.740
 chaos devices a K Zalk yeah exact I still can't do that yeah it's still gonna be exact

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:51.020
 axiok full disclosure I only tinkered with the the first version of it a long time ago

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:56.940
 like a knob gone yeah like one of those things where I was like half interested just was like

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:02.860
 didn't really yeah I don't I don't need this and it is cool but this isn't necessarily what I

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:07.980
 look looking for and so this popped up and I watched a video of it and I was like this is adding a

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:13.180
 lot of cool stuff it seems like it's taking it out of the you're just going around the circle it's

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:17.660
 on a trace line around a circle yeah which is what I was like hoping you know really looking for

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:25.180
 with something that was not bound to either a grid or a line so it's on the surface it's eight steps

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:30.460
 starting the circle starting at twelve o'clock and going around and you can either have it in step

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:37.580
 mode where each step is basically its own unique step or pattern where each of these steps

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:43.580
 has its own sub-sequences or sub-pattern within it and there's a lot of control over the individual

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:48.460
 patterns themselves so you basically control each one like like how many steps are within the

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:53.340
 sub-sequences whether or not and this is the thing that I think is really cool whether or not the

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:59.980
 steps within the sub-sequences are fractions within the master step or their own proper steps

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:06.140
 and you have control over that per step oh yes that's a nice twist on how the elixir does it

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:10.300
 exactly I was and even just playing with I've only had this for like a week now so I've not

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:15.740
 this is not going to be a deep dive into this but I feel like I've confident enough now that

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:20.700
 this is something I really like so that's why I'm talking about it but being able to switch per step

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:26.540
 having like a quick ratchet where I've got some number of steps between the major steps

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:30.380
 you know going through them really quickly versus you know expanding expanding this out to like

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:36.300
 64 step sequencer at the maximum range and you can switch between pattern and step

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:43.420
 on the fly it's all real time switching and there's a custom mode so instead of just going around in

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:49.900
 a circle you can you can basically like tap in your own pattern that you want it to be so it'll you

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:53.980
 can have it bounce around and I don't know what the upper limit of it I think it's like 256

00:50:55.340 --> 00:51:01.580
 of these of these custom steps you can have yeah but that's also entering and leaving that mode

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:05.980
 is a button so it's really for like performing you can like basically let it go around in a

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:09.900
 circle and or you know basically go through its normal pattern and then hit that and then

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:14.700
 it'll start bouncing around the pattern that you have and it's additive like if you basically

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:19.100
 were like I like you know you get like a number of steps in there you hit it shift and you start

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:24.140
 adding more it just tacks them on to the end of your custom sequence oh shit and that also can get

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:29.980
 saved as part of the preset and so there's a bunch of presets for actually saving and loading and

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:38.780
 includes your custom sequences on top of that you've got random slew and probability all as

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:45.180
 non-binary that so that you add a certain amount of like a little bit of random or you crank it up

00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:51.340
 and it's just basically completely out of step like it's out of step that with the expansion is

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:57.900
 CVable so you can just have it like not random at all and then CV send it and then switch between

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:04.860
 variations of random slew is the same way slew is actually per step you set what what mode and what

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:12.460
 behavior you want per step and the last one is probability so probability is how much it's going

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:20.380
 to switch all of the different configurations that you have per step probability itself is a global

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:25.340
 setting like you said like you say like i'm going to increase the probability but the response to

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:32.780
 that probability is evaluated per step so they don't all just shift in unison you'll have one like

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:36.700
 they they're just sort of morphing they're all getting that same probability value but they're

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:43.420
 all morphing in unique ways that's cool yeah and it's um and so it has its own clock divider so it

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:50.220
 has its like you can have internal rate or it takes a clock in or has a divider and multiplier

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:55.820
 you can set the number of steps and what it resets again those are all also CVable

00:52:55.820 --> 00:53:01.580
 based on and i guess i should point out that every time i keep saying it's CVable a lot of

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:09.740
 this is on the expander right so what you get if you just buy this is um you get transport on and off

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:16.380
 reset and directions oh the other thing too is like you just just start going backwards and

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:22.060
 um external out i'm sorry external clock coming in and then finally you've got gate out and CV out

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:26.380
 and what's really interesting and i don't i don't know if the original one had this or not it's not

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:34.300
 something i'd like dove into but you can set different steps on and off and if even if you as it's going

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:40.460
 over a step if it's off i'm using double quotes here it just means it doesn't send a gate out but

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:46.300
 the CV for that step still goes out so like analog style yeah yeah those are a way to make

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:52.060
 that not analog style so that if it's off it's off completely and just skips that step no the only

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:59.580
 the only the only options you have for that are whether you um whether the gate is trigger half

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:06.300
 or full gate is and but yeah otherwise they have the CV continues to uh to go out um as it goes over

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:13.740
 that um that's a good question though and oh and the expander adds a couple of things that are just

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:20.140
 completely not available on the base model you have to get the expander oh absolutely it's

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:25.500
 it's necessary it's not that big like it's you know it's it's they pack a lot of stuff into this

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:31.500
 expander um and so this is where you're going to get all of this like the CV for all of the other

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:39.900
 stuff um and it also includes a per step out so you actually get for each of them gate for

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:45.580
 gate for each of them that's all sorry independently um which i think is one of the which is a pretty

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:53.420
 nice feature yeah the surge sequencer that i have that works that way yes um and that's at the high

00:54:53.420 --> 00:55:01.820
 level question about the randomness is it destructive or can you like have something

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:06.780
 CVing the randomness of that and then revert back to your base pattern it was a very good question

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:11.740
 it is completely not destructive and that's yeah that's so as you're as you're hitting that random

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:16.460
 and especially if you're sending CV to that going absolutely crazy the second you pull that back

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:22.140
 or turn that knob back um all the way off it just reverts back to the to the pattern that was in

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:29.660
 and you can do some cool stuff um this reminded me a little bit of um uh the electron style of

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:36.540
 like when you load a preset in it's instantaneous so you can fuck you can just go absolutely nuts

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:42.220
 and so this is like a fully digital sequencer that has like a very analog vibe absolutely okay

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:45.820
 there's a very good way to describe it and that's and that's one of the things where i was like

00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:52.060
 really this is really appealing to me um and i didn't realize it was really what i was looking for

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:56.940
 i'm definitely very tempted by this in some ways it has a lot more features than the surge

00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:01.580
 sequencer but still like eight steps the only thing it lacks is like another CV out and i get

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:06.860
 why because that wouldn't make sense for this um then the more i think about it it's more like i

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:11.820
 think about how i could use the performer to sequence the surge to sequence this and it's like uh

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:16.860
 fuck you've gone down a rabbit hole at that boy indeed yeah it sounds like a fun one though

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:23.980
 honestly too i was a little worried that there's a lot of um button combinations uh to do this

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:32.380
 uh but honestly within an hour i'm bouncing around this thing doing all of the stuff and um the panel

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:38.060
 sort like it has labels for all of it like everything is pretty upfront about what they're like even

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:42.940
 when you're going in doing the per step um editing press down the button for that step you're editing

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:49.580
 it what is all of the lights then say what is on or off for that step and oh

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:56.860
 and a lot of the settings have the same thing like quantize uh you could turn quantize on or off

00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:02.540
 but quantize is based on different scales and the scales are written right here so you hold down

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:08.140
 quantize for a couple of seconds it pops up and whatever if you are quantized to say like uh

00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:12.780
 chromatic that button's pressed you press another one you're now in a different scale can you see

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:16.380
 the rotate sequence?

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:21.900
 rotate it at all? no okay that is but i never even thought about doing something that that's a

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:28.860
 cool idea but no there's no like this is this step one is kind of fixed to step one i love that

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:35.100
 they don't have a screen on it or even like any indicator um because not a totally derail but that

00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:41.260
 jack mat harlequin's contact which i really like um which they made it simpler at the end of the day

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:46.700
 and just like a bank in like four banks of four presets let me set the position and that's

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:52.460
 fucking it basically i'm i'm a hundred percent on the same team with that i love it and i'm definitely

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:57.100
 going to use it for the uh i'm using i'm going to be using the palette for like live shit

00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:05.180
 delusions palette and um the harlequin's context and um paired up with plats um and the filter

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:09.900
 that's running into it's it's working great i there's a couple times i'm like wait what did i just do

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:15.420
 yeah fuck and it's i'm getting confident to the point where i'm feeling okay using a live but i've

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:19.580
 definitely at home sitting there kind of going like actually don't know what mode i'm in right now

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:24.220
 yep and that is and it's even reading the book i'm just like this is three pages too long

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:29.180
 they really should just like pull this back just a little bit and because features that are like

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:33.900
 it has a little bit of that vibe of like well we can do it well you didn't actually check to see

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:38.060
 if you should right because it's much more confusing knowing like what does that letter stand for

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:42.700
 oh that's a sine wave in a minelfo mode i don't really give a fuck about that right now but you're

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:47.340
 in a different mode so now all of those shapes mean something else yeah and that's what i was like

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:52.860
 oh i just wish i wish i always knew that like that little squiggy thing squiggly thing was the saw up

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:57.500
 and that just always was and a always meant one thing and that's like not having that is like

00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:02.860
 it's just a bridge too far and it's not a i still like it and i think what it does is

00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:07.660
 fucking amazing and worthwhile i just wish they would have backed off i wish they would make like a

00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:12.940
 dumb mode that just did like offsets in the banks like that nothing else i would not be

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.300
 mad at that because that's what i'm doing with it it's like like i've got everything set up

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:23.020
 words i got the scenes in the axe and and i'm going to bounce between them i just i want a to do that

00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:29.820
 and now i want to do something different and now it's and it's simple stuff e g offsets some lfo

00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:35.420
 maybe with uh you know taking a gate to reset you know like that that's all i want everything after

00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:41.100
 that i'm not going to use in this just kind of mad night it's embarrassing but even scenes and

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:45.660
 acts i keep confusing which one is the parent of the other one because i wasn't fucking theater so

00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:51.580
 i did it you know i'm the same way it doesn't make sense to me whereas like banks and presets i'm

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:56.620
 like oh yeah like bank if you name it bank then maybe i should just remember that one is the bank

00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:01.100
 or just scratch it out on the panel i'm getting close to that it's also a white panel and their

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:07.100
 panels aren't bad but i like you know oh that going back to this this is uh i got the silver

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:10.780
 panels for both of these just because that's what was immediately available they've got black

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:16.700
 panels for both of these and i'm the second i can get one a hundred percent getting the

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:21.820
 other black panel versions of both of these um so i'm sold on it like i i can see using this for a

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:26.860
 long time and i even just the couple of days that i've had it um getting a ton of use on it like

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:31.820
 immediately became like i was comfortable using it started using it for all kind of you know like

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.260
 even just like doing like the difference being like like all me use this for like notes and

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:39.260
 playing a melody oh yeah so i was just gonna ask and then switching it up and going like now i'm

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:46.620
 just using it as a cv sequence or something else um okay yeah it's it's it's great i honestly the

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:52.220
 the list of complaints i would have at this point are i i don't have one i mean maybe by the next

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.540
 time i show up all some complaints but everything's super intuitive and it's doing it what i want

01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:02.060
 can you uh make it be bipolar or unipolar you absolutely can thank you for asking

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:07.500
 fuck that was so inorganic you got it wrong yeah i got it wrong earlier so we had to retake

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:14.940
 um yes yes nick as a matter of fact you can go into bipolar mode um for each step uh no it's

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:22.700
 it's it is a global global set uh and it goes from zero to eight or bipolar plus minus five oh cool

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:28.220
 okay which i have not screwed around with too much um honestly i've been just been doing the the

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:34.140
 unipolar zero to eight that's probably what yeah and i probably will screw around with uh the

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:39.900
 bipolar because going into that mode it's shift it's two button presses to get into that and switch it

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:47.660
 there's really no harm in trying fuck that's cool yeah so i think they nailed it again so far

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:52.860
 i really like the stuff that they do like it's eight hours cold dead hands for me like i will

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:58.620
 never get rid of that um that's really the only two products of theirs that i have but

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:03.420
 i now i'm like fuck i need to start looking at like patome or or dessa or some of these other

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:08.380
 products they make because i it's sort of like that noise engineering thing where i'm like i feel

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:14.540
 like they're we're on similar wavelength and yeah this is uh anything else how much is it running

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:22.780
 oh um no i was just looking according to perfect circuit the sequencer itself over any 420

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:30.940
 the expander is 200 that sounds about what i paid for yeah seems appropriate as well okay but

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:35.580
 you got to get that coupon code yeah get that holiday ten percent discount everyone knows about

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:44.540
 coupon codes right coupon just try the last holiday and the last the last two digits of the year

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:51.100
 it might still be working generally yeah yeah so yeah that's my uh that's my overview i might like

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:57.500
 i said i may have more to say as i dive further and further into it but um i got a place in the

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:03.740
 i got a place in the rack and it's and it's also filling in a gap um that the only other thing i had

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:10.380
 close to it was that ryovcc sequencer that um is cool but i immediately moved to the video

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:15.100
 rack it's really the only thing it's like it's really good for like audio stuff it's

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:21.820
 it really is just it an eight eight step analog sequencer turns out not super useful kind of

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:29.980
 be yeah opposite of that no options yeah yeah it's good for video stuff yeah you know

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:38.460
 so yeah um i'm not gonna lie that's basically the end of my uh my list my list was talking about

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:46.780
 the how excited i was about the elixir firmware stuff going back in the v1 solid edition yeah definitely

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:55.660
 Nick you have uh your cheating it's the only other one i think i want to talk to you're cheating

01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:01.580
 you're looking at the spreadsheet it's true see the fucking spreadsheet being manipulated in real

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:06.460
 time and tapping it oh shit watching it that's trippy through the cloud wow

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:14.860
 ecology we're all it professionals in some way to ever form when i tap that input box on this

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:25.980
 computer i see it update on the other how how does that work black magic but yeah the uh

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:34.940
 cosmetronic cosmix though i did happen to get one of those through control mod um a couple popped

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:39.660
 up they've been out of stock for a hot minute because he was working on the market too and i

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:46.060
 think there may have been some component issues with the mark one or something too um but yeah i'm

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:51.580
 super into it i've tried um a few euro rack mixers now including the pittsburgh modalor one which

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:58.060
 the system interface um which was kind of the first like little mini console within a euro rack

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:04.380
 modular i had which was cool but had a number of issues um some bleed and just the mute switches

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:10.620
 were kind of funky um so yeah this cosmix is pretty rad for the most part it sounds great

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:14.700
 like it's got that you know you've talked about the dual band maximizer before you've talked about

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:19.340
 all this in a previous episode can we get on for the listeners a high level overview oh yeah yeah

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:23.660
 so high level overview you've got what four mono two stereo inputs

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:35.100
 in ox and sand that's mono um the regular output the maximizer dual band boost which you can turn

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:41.180
 on and off globally then you've got each individual channel and i'm glad that they mark this um on

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:48.060
 the fader throw up like 50ish is just normal zero to 100 percent and then everything above that is

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:54.140
 distortion saturation kind of which is really nice so you've got yeah it's like pretty barebones

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:59.180
 and mute um switches across the top which are clickless i don't know if the first one was clickless

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:06.460
 too it's clickless okay um so you have the mark two then i do i got the new mark two which also

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:12.860
 allows for the big differences you can chain them now okay um behind the panel there's a little

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:17.340
 three pin connector and you can chain mark one or mark two as long as you have a mark two at the end

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:24.460
 you can chain mark ones or mark two so you can pass that entire group of signals into the next one

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:30.220
 before any distortion so you can get a clean input and then just re-distort everything on the whole

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:34.140
 on the last one on the chain interesting i think you can do that with like up to eight of them or

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:38.940
 something i have to do oh you do mark one but they're both mark ones yeah

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:46.460
 you got me thinking maybe i'll uh swap one of those out yeah try the new jam that would make sense

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:50.940
 does the output for each of the ones that are um a part of the chain does the output of them still

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:55.100
 are they still active or are they sort of turned off and like there's like a master out at the end

01:06:55.100 --> 01:07:01.180
 that's a good question i don't know exactly how that works i think it just sums it but i don't

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:06.300
 know where it would just pick that too if it just forwards it all to like the mix outs yeah yeah

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:10.620
 that's probably how it works and you just gut it there transparently at whatever levels you upset

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:15.660
 on the other ones otherwise they'd be basically just still be independent right yeah yeah true

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:20.540
 so it's got to be doing that too have like that parent sum right right pre-distortion

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:25.260
 yeah i didn't know the mark two's were even out i knew that it seems you know they're being

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:30.220
 discussed at one point uh i thought you just had a mark one like i have that's cool i'm gonna have

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:35.260
 to look into them yeah because i think they're all mark two now yeah it just popped up on control

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.420
 mod one day they're not really announced then they announced like yeah we've got a bunch of stores

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:44.300
 with them because perfect circuit had a pre-order but you know control smart they didn't even ship

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:48.860
 mine until a few days later and that's when perfect circuit had theirs and stuff so they got me

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:54.700
 success um but i love how it sounds like just a little bit of that saturation goes a long way

01:07:54.700 --> 01:08:01.580
 and can make a mix sound really good um some complaints the mute switch is and he or the person

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:06.860
 that makes it they clarified it to say that there's like a fat in there and that's why it's kind of

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:12.140
 gummy when you mute and unmute stuff it takes like a little bit of a second um i don't really

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:17.260
 like that about it i will still use my muton for live shit just because that clickelcy mutes like

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:23.100
 perfectly i kind of was as well uh the muton was one of the things that i sold when i was like

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:29.900
 downsizing a bit get into here um but yeah i i was doing the same thing like there was a

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:37.820
 few videos i had on instagram where like i was utilizing both cosmetronics but using the

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:44.060
 mutes on the muton as like performance mutes right over the ones on the cotchron like they're a nice

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:49.020
 addition but yeah they're not so great for performing mutes that's exactly what i mean

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:55.180
 are the mutes cvable can you send gate to the mute oh oh okay switches okay yeah and it's got pan

01:08:55.180 --> 01:09:03.660
 control for the formano panels um that's the last feature that i didn't describe but yeah super

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:09.020
 happy with it it's got like that console feel um i do wish the mutes were a little better but it

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:14.780
 doesn't matter because the mutons there and that's fine i'm still a big fan of mine as well yeah it

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:22.220
 sounds great um no complaints it's definitely the thing i was looking for good layout um do you

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:26.380
 know if they change anything between the mark one and the mark two as far as the uh overdriver

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:30.780
 distortion circuit yeah they apparently will be the cleaner so i don't know some of that was

01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:36.860
 affected um what else did they do oh yeah the sliders um they apparently made them a little better

01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:40.940
 which i'm glad because i can't imagine them being like too much worse they're not like the best

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:46.940
 throw it's kind of like off off off on kind of thing without that much resolution but it does

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:52.300
 the trick like it still does the job apparently that was a little more inconsistent on the mark one

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:58.060
 and some of them were different they are yeah you can you can compare channels and some of them in

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.940
 the volume will not be 100 consistent it's got um

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:08.620
 fucking trim pots on the back for control with the level of each one so you can make it

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:14.620
 perfect oh gosh the mark one doesn't have zero zero sold on this is a this illusion oh yeah i

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:18.860
 can't imagine not using it i don't know what would take its place aside from yeah the

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:26.780
 even the WMD performance mixer is great but compared to the like size costs um ratio it's like i

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:32.460
 can't imagine going to that it would be cool if these were also vca's like that is but that's like

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:37.660
 asking too much in a way right um and i have the vca's already in the mutons so it works out perfectly

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:43.740
 yeah super stoked on it i'm so glad i got it it kind of was the rug that tied the modular together

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:49.500
 a little again that's kind of how i felt too yeah i mean really um yeah i don't know

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:56.140
 tied everything together in that rig you know i mean like i sold all my other mixing modules that i

01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:02.380
 had unless you count like tangle quartet or something but i don't really use that as a sub mixer even

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:07.900
 though you can like that's more like not an attenuator vca dedicated for me totally um

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:13.580
 and i love i never use the mix out on the tangle yeah i don't think i've ever touched it oh yeah i

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:19.500
 have a few times um no generally i don't though i just got mine drinks right beside my stereo mix

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:24.620
 from the FACO that's where mine generally was too and that was actually kind of a plan um i was

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:31.340
 hoping to not in a way use the muton for the mutes um but it it doesn't really matter at the end of

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:37.980
 the day mutons i think are hard to come by now they're discontinued for some reason i don't know why

01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:43.820
 it's such a like a good um module maybe they just couldn't get the part anymore or something maybe

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:47.900
 not everyone recognized what a great module it is and it didn't sell well it wouldn't be the first

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:54.540
 thing that people didn't figure out why they needed it yeah it's got this weird like purple and blue

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:59.340
 panel color accent too and i really fucking love that i don't know wish more things were like i've

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:05.020
 been on a purple kick i'm weird purple same here i mean not with like modular stuff but just in

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:11.100
 general uh like i've realized like uh when i've been doing videos stuff recently oh purple just

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:18.060
 leaning on like leaning into it yeah i don't know why it's a weird color i'm like i haven't even

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:24.060
 like enjoyed a pair of shoes in a long time i just fucking love that color it makes me yeah purple

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:30.460
 i feel like purple is a very psychedelic color yeah definitely like stir something in the brain

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:37.900
 you know like i even like like pastel purple too like this like lilac shit i'm like yeah yeah

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:43.420
 fucking right i don't know i don't know what to do we should probably let this up this might mean

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:50.460
 something yeah maybe we're having some issues more more issues than normal that i would believe

01:12:51.260 --> 01:13:00.460
 yeah um those are gonna talk about knob con are we going to knob con who could tell knob con

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:06.540
 it's a good question so i know i feel about that what my main my main worry is that there's

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:11.980
 nothing going to be there that it's too late for anyone to really organize a significant trip like

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:18.460
 this but like the result of that could be um there's not so much focus on manufacturers and like the

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:24.220
 show space and it basically turns into like a synth meat instead like it was for the first year or two

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:29.660
 that would be really cool like the potential for this to turn into like a knob con that we would

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:35.100
 actually have fun at is i think a little bit better than it was as it got more and more focused on

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:41.900
 like shows and reveals and the manufacturer focus um that's where i'm at and you know i'm vaccinated

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:48.300
 i assume we're gonna have a booster between now and then i i think we always do a very good job

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:54.620
 of entertaining ourselves without questions so i probably find a way to do that this time too

01:13:54.620 --> 01:14:00.140
 plus it's chicago things are starting to pop off again there's no reason why we can't just

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:06.460
 hit the shit during the day and then just grab the fucking chicago for the evening and

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:10.220
 fuck truth find something going on you know the worst case scenario was this convention is

01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:15.740
 terrible and we have a hotel room and we just go hang out in chicago all weekend yeah that's really

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:23.340
 like the absolute worst it could happen yeah i mean it's a long drive to you know to gamble on but

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:29.660
 truth it's been it's been two years since we've made that drive right yeah i was like we could do it

01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:36.460
 i'm kind of into the idea of it i wasn't at first but yes i am but i'm kind of warming up to it a lot

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:41.020
 over the last couple weeks i'm like you know that sounds like that would be fucking cool but um

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:49.420
 also uh i'm kind of interested in just seeing chicago again you know i mean sure like it's been

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:53.180
 some part of the city proper i don't think we've done that in a long time aside from like stopping

01:14:53.180 --> 01:15:02.300
 at uh a place to eat right right um yeah i'd be into it if you guys are i'm i think i'm into it

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:07.980
 and it'll give us something to complain about when we get back right up so it's all about generating

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:13.580
 content we are content creators and influencers or we could try to do an episode one there

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:18.940
 we always say always say that but it never works and i think we all know why

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:27.660
 because we get like you're like because we're getting white girl wasted at the at the fucking

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:35.980
 metal bar okay we're gonna go back and we're gonna record no no that's absolutely not what

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:40.380
 we're doing all right we're gonna go downstairs with the shitty rave and then we're gonna come back

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:49.340
 up and we're gonna record nope no damn listeners we're probably gonna be at knobcon look us up

01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:54.060
 you have no idea what we look like well i guess there's pictures of us i remember i i fucking

01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:58.620
 hate that picture we need a new goddamn picture oh yeah yeah i'd be into it i look so miserable in that

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:02.380
 picture i look properly miserable in that picture i love it i mean i'm gonna look i'm gonna try

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:09.500
 look the same yeah it captures me yeah no well it doesn't capture me i look like yeah i don't know

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:15.980
 i guess it does well i mean there's nothing to stop here fucking alien mutant there's nothing

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:20.460
 stopping us from taking a new picture of ourselves that's true we should get someone who has like a

01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:26.940
 fancy camera to make like a like our like resident advisor level like promo shot like like a like a

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:33.340
 black background we sort of fade into it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah under under a bridge

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:38.380
 just all in a different pose all looking in a different direction oh oh oh yeah wait wait you're

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:44.700
 gonna do it yeah yeah yeah you'll be absolutely okay i'm yeah i'm i'm i'm on board with this

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:49.020
 i feel like i'm something we got to do in the fall though because we all have to wear a hoodie for

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:55.260
 sure yeah yeah yeah i don't i don't look my best in the summer i'm just gonna be sweating there's

01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:02.140
 like no way for that to stop you two look fine i'm just do my hair is a little fucking poof ball

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:09.820
 one side you know hate it but it's kind of under control right now a little bit but not really

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:15.180
 if you told me you wouldn't intend to do that i would have believed it i just saw we'll go

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:21.180
 my son all right i worked i looked anywhere it's a good enough i mean this is after wearing like a

01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:27.020
 fucking VR helmet on it for six hours straight and somehow still managed to be somewhat kempt looking

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:28.860
 at me i wouldn't guess that yeah

01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:36.060
 so is that it all right one more thing oh what you got

01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:43.580
 riddish noise electronics oh yes cascading fed amplifier model pretty excited about

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:50.220
 well let let everybody excited about let everyone know what is it so first off it doesn't have like

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:57.100
 a proper name that i've seen they're literally just calling it cascading fed amplifier so i have

01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:07.020
 a proposal um we can call it the uh the the cas feta cas feta like feta like the cheese cas

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:13.900
 feta yeah it's feta okay cas feta kind of like enosque yeah cas feta cas feta fucking monster

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:19.180
 accent on the first part you cas feta cas feta what do you think is that is that good

01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:28.540
 until you want to be the yeah no that's nice yeah damn it um basic overview and that's just what

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:37.500
 i've been able to glean from the uh instagram demos uh just four channels of amplification um

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:46.780
 with dedicated feedback knob for each channel and cv control for each feedback channel um and

01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:55.020
 from what i can tell a basic like two band eq at the time for sub and high end frequencies um

01:18:55.020 --> 01:19:02.540
 each of those two band channels has a button next to it with like a little circle so i'm guessing

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:08.700
 that is where the feedback on off is coming from like maybe you can only feedback the high channels

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:13.820
 or uh low channels if you want or both or none it's not like a different mode i'm not entirely

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:21.180
 sure okay um that that could also be what switches it because he uh British know electronics

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:28.140
 make a ansem set in a post in a comment that you can use it in the cascading mode or

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:39.740
 stereo mode maybe that's what the channels are doing let's firely sure yeah um but yeah the

01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:47.740
 conceptually i i fucking love it like it's it reminds me very much of how i use my mackeys you

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:54.140
 know me four channels of cascading preamps with basic two channel eq in between each channel and

01:19:54.140 --> 01:20:03.340
 i usually have a channel dedicated for feedback um this is like that but in a compact module and

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:07.660
 cv control of the feedback which is just fucking mind blowing me because

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:15.020
 there really isn't much out there that offers cv over feedback control unless you're you know

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:21.020
 using a bunch of other shit like vca's and stuff the dark matter dark matter does it but

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:25.980
 that's only one channel you know i mean the whole module only one channel right and this

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:30.060
 the fact that you can have four stacked on each other like that's

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:36.300
 in my opinion you know i mean the way i fuck with shit that is where a lot of the magic

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:41.500
 comes from when you push preamps into interesting territory is to stack them you know i mean you

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:46.060
 start layering it and you have feedback in between and it just makes the whole system unstable you

01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:50.700
 know i mean that's yeah that's the shit that i fucking love and like this that's what always

01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:56.620
 kind of bothered me about dark matter it didn't feel like it was offering me much over what i

01:20:56.620 --> 01:21:02.380
 could already accomplish with my mixers and vca or my mackey right i mean the cross-fighter was

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:08.300
 cool novelty but overall i didn't really dig the sound of the dark matter it sounded a little too

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:15.340
 nasally for me as far as the overdraw goes and the low end a little too muddy um that's just me

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:22.460
 being super fucking picky right um well so for the um for this do you know what the preamps are

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:30.060
 modeled on no clue okay but i'm guessing a fucking old mackey probably was some sort of

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:35.020
 inspiration for this or not i i should probably ask him because i am curious i don't know if this is

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:40.140
 you know something entirely of his own you know design or if this was meant to emulate

01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:46.940
 uh some sort of old preamps that he was already familiar with but um i'm guessing just because

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:51.580
 of the workflow of it and how it reminds me of the mackey that this probably he was probably

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:55.100
 fucking around on a mackey or an old similar mixer and have the same thought like right make

01:21:55.100 --> 01:22:05.100
 some module um so yeah conceptually i'm all about this the sound from the instagram demos also sound

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:09.740
 really good to me to me even though it's in a you know a compressed instagram video or whatever

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:14.860
 yeah that does sound good it yeah it's similar to their other modules you know i mean it seems to

01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:21.500
 have that proper level of low end and crunch on top that i enjoy obviously you're not going to be

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:27.980
 buying this for clean mixing you know i mean like this kind of it's pretty upfront from what

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:34.060
 you would be using this for you know and it's destructive distortion feedback manipulation

01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:42.860
 yeah the only downside about it so far is that it does not seem like it's going to be available

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:52.860
 anytime so really what's did i give an estimate he showed me um a screenshot of some of the

01:22:52.860 --> 01:23:00.460
 component availability estimates through his you know providers um and right now looks like

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:05.580
 some of the components if he still tries to use those components would be years uh worth of waiting

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:13.420
 before he could like crank this out and mass um so for now i guess there's just a handful that

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:19.100
 he's made us like prototypes that he's like making these instagram demos with they look fucking great

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:25.660
 they sound great um but yeah i'm going to try to not get too overly hyped for it probably not going

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:32.700
 to be able to get my hands on one anytime soon but i will say uh i think they have some of the best

01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:38.460
 looking modules in the game right now i know something about aesthetic and the knobs and

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:42.780
 everything it's just like okay i wish more people would take a little bit of a chance like they did

01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:51.580
 it looks like very dated outboard gear you know i mean like that kind of mat gray finish

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:58.300
 home like the chunky knobs you know i'm like yeah i dig it it reminds me like just looking at

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:04.300
 it reminds me of like an old mackey or something you know i mean yeah look at the mat gray um feel

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:11.500
 i liked the schwaeman modules that were gray too same yeah that was the last thing on my list i'm

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:15.260
 i was very hyped about that it kind of came out of nowhere you know i mean i was not expecting to

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:26.140
 see a module like that pop up right in here

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:46.260
 Thank you.
