WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:23.680
 We're drinking some meat.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.640
 We are drinking meat.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 This is a sparkling meat that I got in California.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.160
 It's a place outside of San Francisco.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.800
 Friends, friends Heather and Ryan took us out.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.560
 Very strange place, like very unique place.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.840
 A bunch of varieties of meat,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.200
 which I didn't really know was a thing.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.200
 It was, it's sparkling made with champagne.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.760
 That makes it different than normal meat,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.120
 but there were like 12 varieties that they had there

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.320
 and they were each pretty unique.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.240
 They still had a little bit of that honey vibe to it,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.720
 but like the honey itself was different

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.440
 based on what the bee had pollinated and gotten from.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.320
 There's a lot of science that people smarter than me

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.800
 could probably fill in here and listen to her

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.240
 could probably Google this shit.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.600
 So the place is Hydron Metery.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.240
 It's in Point Ray's station, California.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.880
 It was, it's an awesome place to go.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.560
 Also, Point Ray's station was this like adorable little town

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.920
 out in the middle of California somewhere.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 Like it had an awesome bookstore where like,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.800
 if I wasn't, if I hadn't flown there,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.280
 I definitely would have just left for like 20 bucks.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.760
 Like high weirdness.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.760
 Oh yeah.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.960
 And then like a feel, like a book,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.360
 just recording people on how they do their field recordings.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.200
 That's awesome.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.360
 And there was like two other books I got

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.640
 and like I would have,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.480
 only cause I had to take them home on a plane.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.800
 I could have kept going.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.760
 So yeah, the whole place was great.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.600
 And yeah, this meat, this fantastic.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.240
 So what the hell were you doing in California today?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.080
 Yeah, what the?

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.320
 Not just getting meat, I presume.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.320
 It was not.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.680
 I was there for the recombinant festival.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.240
 It was put on by not of rhythm and noise

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.480
 for all of the old industrial nerds.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.400
 - Aspidl record label was his.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.240
 - Yeah.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.080
 Yeah.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.120
 It was an insane lineup.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.120
 The show was astounding.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.920
 If anyone has a chance to go,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.440
 I have not a single bad thing to say about it.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.200
 Like from the time we got there to the time we left,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.120
 it was amazing audio visual.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.680
 And then like the, the video was like,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.080
 two stories tall or maybe even higher,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.800
 maybe three stories, like half a football field wide,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.560
 four K and like a variety.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.600
 Like one thing would be like weird shapes.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.000
 The other one was like this decomposed,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.480
 like decaying building modeled.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.440
 And then it was like morphing into other things.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.880
 Finesse, by tone.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.200
 And then like just weird maniacs from San Francisco.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.840
 All of them were fucking amazing.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.760
 Like there was no, there was no filler.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.600
 There's no downtime.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.640
 It was just like every act after the other was great.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.600
 So that's why we were there.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.520
 But then we went to this other place to the Metery.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.360
 - Sweet.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.360
 - And the variety we have now we're drinking is the

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.360
 moddrus.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.520
 - Yeah, that's correct.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.360
 - Oh, close enough.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.960
 Moddrus carrot blossom.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.320
 It doesn't even taste that much like carrot.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.160
 - Yeah.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.000
 - Very refreshing.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.240
 - I saw that and was wondering what to expect.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.600
 But it's just like hard to describe in words,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.680
 especially as I'm not like a meat drinker.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.600
 So I can't like describe it as well as like a tea

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.440
 or something like that.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.440
 - Right, right.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.560
 Yeah, I don't know what the,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.720
 even like the wine sort of doesn't seem like

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.040
 it's applicable here.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.880
 But no, I love it.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.840
 And it was, and like I said, we were there.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.200
 We were getting flights while the varieties they had.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.600
 And each one was very unique.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.000
 Like all of it was well outside of like my idea of like

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.240
 sort of like honey, mead.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.080
 Someone couldn't taste any honey at all.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.920
 - Yeah.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.280
 - It's really light too.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.080
 It's not as like syrupy, thick as like some other meat

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.920
 I've had before.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.600
 - That's what I've always envisioned mead being.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.600
 Like just really syrupy, thick, like honey

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.040
 with alcohol in it basically.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.400
 I've only tasted it one time and it was a little too thick

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.160
 for my liking, but I haven't tried it since.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.000
 - Do you want to try some of this?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.840
 - Yeah, I got a lime bubbly.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.680
 - All right.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.000
 - Right here.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.800
 Do you want to go, do you want to give us all the flavor

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.800
 notes on that lime bubbly?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.640
 - No.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.480
 Sorry.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.040
 - I had one of those the other day and I thought it tasted

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.960
 more like a sprite than other kind of,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.600
 it was like a sprite without the sugar.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.040
 - Yeah, I was into it actually.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.440
 - I think it's from the same

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.760
 evil corporation.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.600
 - Right.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.760
 - I think bubbly is, it's either Pepsi or Coke.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.320
 Let me look on the ball.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.000
 It's one of the big ones.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.520
 I can't find it on there, but yeah, I know bubbly is like

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.240
 Pepsi or Coke's version of La Croix.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.880
 So that's a bottle.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.000
 - I might explain the similarity there.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.640
 It's probably the same artificial flavorings.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.800
 - The same muskrat gland was used.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.880
 We expressed this muskrat into the same vial.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.400
 - A sprite.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.960
 (laughs)

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.720
 - What if that's the thing we get sued over?

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.280
 What's the, that's finally, that's the line we crossed.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.360
 - That is a trade secret, sir.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.480
 - All of our muskrat extraction is cruelty free.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.160
 - We do let them vape, bro.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.760
 - I feel like I just went into the void there.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.240
 It's like, I don't know what to do with anything right now.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.360
 - So, I mean, we didn't really talk about this beforehand,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.880
 but I mean, is there anything we need to address

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.840
 with the coronavirus and its relationship with synthesizers?

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.760
 - I think we should.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.240
 I think we should give our listeners a little context.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.560
 - Yep.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.480
 - Via coronavirus limiting all of our existences.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.880
 - We're locked down government mandate today

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.160
 on the day of March 15th.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.360
 - The Ides of March.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.200
 - Yeah.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.640
 - We're supposed to be aware of them.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.760
 - Fuck.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.760
 - Fuck that up.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.600
 - It's impacting module manufacturing.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.440
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.280
 - Good point.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.880
 - Quite an extent.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.800
 That's one of the major contributors to the delay

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.240
 of us getting our effects aids.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.240
 - Yeah.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.720
 - Modules from happy nerding.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.520
 The Chinese manufacturing.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.080
 - Yeah, China's on lockdown still.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.440
 - Factories that build our shit are not functioning.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.720
 Not manned.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.440
 People are still quarantined over there.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.600
 So delayed the manufacturing of the last batch

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.520
 of that module for like a month.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.440
 And I think the next batch is finally being made right now

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.640
 and shipping out the places like Schneider's Layton

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.640
 and things like that.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.280
 - Now is it still being manufactured in China

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.720
 or are they found alternative sources?

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.040
 - I think so, yeah.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.280
 - It was just a, they had a wait for the delay

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.120
 to be over.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.320
 It's about all I know about it.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.600
 You know, he didn't provide a whole lot of insight.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.360
 I just know it was manufactured in China

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.600
 and the factories closed basically due to Corona.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.360
 So it's been a month behind.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.920
 And Alokhaven hasn't gotten the second batch in

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.640
 which it sold out of the first batch like immediately.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.480
 - Yeah.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.720
 - It's looking like made to April now or something like that.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.160
 But yeah, that's one that got me.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160
 I'm like ridiculously into that.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.200
 Like just the stereo effect nature of it

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.040
 and the way he has like mono signals working

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.640
 and it just sounds like really good.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.080
 I'm pretty into it.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.000
 - I'm hyped for it.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.400
 The amount of algorithms he's making available is insane.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.360
 I even like requested a couple of custom ones

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.880
 and he managed to whip it up within a couple of days.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.720
 Yeah. - Oh, yeah.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.560
 - Oh, nice.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.440
 - I wanted a reverb that was kind of similar

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.280
 to a pedal from Earth Quaker devices

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.920
 which is no longer in, what's the word?

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.440
 - No longer in production?

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.280
 - Production, thank you.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.200
 I don't know why my brain isn't working today.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.960
 It's been discontinued.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.920
 And I always wanted like a module version of that pedal

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.640
 with some CV functionality which seemed like

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.600
 it could be easily done 'cause it's not that complex.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.800
 It's just called the Earth Quaker Trans-Misser.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.080
 - I'm not familiar with that one.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.240
 - Yeah, it was a deal with that one.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.840
 It's a mono reverb that has its own feedback loop

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.160
 filter built in.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.560
 It achieves a weird resonant screechiness

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.240
 that you can hit.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.360
 It's good for drones, things like that.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.760
 I've always been fascinated by the pedal of it.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.920
 And I just always wanted a little module of it

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.880
 that you could CV things like the frequency

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.560
 and things like that.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.320
 And he was able to whip up an algorithm

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.680
 that was his interpretation of it within a couple of days.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.880
 - And lots of made the pull, yeah.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.800
 - So is there gonna be updates like that?

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.520
 Is there gonna be firmware updates

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.080
 or some way to add new algorithms?

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.760
 - Oh yeah, he's been doing it like every few days.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.760
 - Oh wow.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.400
 - Yeah, he's adding more and more to it.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.200
 - An app to manage some of that.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.440
 So you get like 32 effects on the module at one time

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.960
 and then there's an app that you could use

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.440
 to kind of like shuffle those things on to there.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.200
 - Rearrange them, put on ones you want,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.680
 take out ones you don't.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.920
 - Do you know how it connects to the module?

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.760
 - I do not, not off the top of my head.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.760
 - I was gonna say hopefully it's not picket.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.880
 - Yeah, yeah hopefully.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.040
 - I don't think anyone uses picket except Scott.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.600
 - And now I can't find a fucking programmer

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.600
 and like Spark fun and DigiKey,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.280
 they're all like, I mean get on the waiting list.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.920
 - You should just sell the chips at that point.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.520
 That's what four millisecond did

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.520
 'cause they had, you had to get a picket

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.200
 to like update the peg and stuff.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.920
 And they just ended up selling the chips.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.400
 So I just bought those.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.760
 - Certain shops also offer updating services.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.600
 - That's true.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.440
 - I'm just gonna bring it to like control or

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.520
 which is something like this.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.800
 - I just don't wanna get a picket for this one fucking thing

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.160
 where I never use it again.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.000
 - Right.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.520
 - But hopefully the FEX aid does not actually have

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.880
 that route and it's just you just jam a USB in there.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.440
 - It has to be nice.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.200
 - If they're gonna make an app like something.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.040
 - That's cool though.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.480
 Frankly, I was super interested in it

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.120
 and then I saw it was really hard to get

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.040
 and I just kind of stopped paying attention.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.640
 I was like, I'll wait, maybe in a year

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.320
 when it's readily available.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.160
 - I did too.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.160
 I gave up 'cause Greg had been saying like,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.320
 oh, this thing is unobtainium kind of.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.240
 - Yeah.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.320
 - And then I saw the comparison to the Strymon pedal

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.120
 and I was like, oh shit.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.880
 And then he started to go into a few more algorithms

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.840
 and I'm like, dude, this is like kind of,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.840
 this would be amazing to have in my modular.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.840
 - Absolutely.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.840
 - It's like one sixteenths the size of a ZDSP.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.840
 And it's definitely smaller than the new Tiptop

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.440
 like Z series.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.560
 - Right.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.040
 - And even the Strymon.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.040
 - Yeah, and the Strymon.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.320
 - The big gigantic Strymon modules.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.280
 - Magneto, yeah.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.400
 - Or even some of their pedals,

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.920
 which I had like a weird rig for a while

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.000
 to route out of the modular and TRS stereo in and out

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.440
 through the pedals back in and all that shit.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.640
 - I'm not fucking with that anymore.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.960
 - Yeah, I can't. - It's kind of a pain.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.840
 - It's also stereo in, which a lot of effects modules

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.680
 still aren't.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.520
 - Yeah, that's cool.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.640
 - Including all the Tiptops.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.880
 - The effects idea.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.760
 It crammed a lot of good functionality into a tiny package.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.880
 - We were talking about last episode about like

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.560
 the sort of like the evolution of stereo in your rack.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.080
 - It still blows in mind that the Tiptops are all monoman.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.160
 - Yeah, I don't like that.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.000
 - Why?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.160
 - I still go back to the idea that they just saw

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.840
 so many people using a stat cable to go from left to right.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.680
 - Sure.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.520
 - I've been doing it for years.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.360
 - Yeah.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.200
 - Yeah.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.040
 - If you make a lot of mono modules too,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.840
 it's just be like, "Ha, this fits in our model."

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.680
 - Yep.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.520
 - Fuck you.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.360
 - Yeah.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.000
 - But like what if you want two effects modules?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.520
 You want to route your Tiptop delay

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.280
 into your Tiptop reverb?

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.120
 You know what I mean?

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.120
 I don't know.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.120
 It just seems like you're making your shit more

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.040
 incompatible for people who want to double down

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.760
 on like the Tiptop effects line up and shit like that.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.840
 It was one of the deciding factors that made me

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.440
 cancel my pre-order, which I had with Perfect Circuit

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.640
 for the Z5000 and instead decided I was going to get

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.920
 two effects hates instead.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.760
 - Yeah.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.600
 - Why wouldn't you?

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.440
 - Yeah.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.440
 - You know, it doesn't make sense to get the Z5 over that.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.400
 - I mean, except for the fact that I'm still waiting now.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.240
 - Yeah.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.440
 - But other than that, yeah, it made sense to me.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.920
 - Alright, so what do you got here?

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.760
 No, yeah.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.320
 What I just slapped on the table is an MPC1,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.960
 which is a, you've used Noct track before.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.880
 - I have.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.920
 - This is one of the most complicated goddamn machines ever.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.760
 - Are you shooting me?

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.840
 - There is every feature you've ever imagined

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.520
 that would be an MPC is jammed into this thing.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.120
 - I thought that was the point of the one

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.360
 is to not be that.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.200
 - No.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.560
 - Like I thought the X and the live were kind of supposed

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.560
 to be very versatile, kind of convoluted.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.800
 And this was supposed to be like the stripped down,

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.800
 easier to use, easier to perform with option.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.640
 - You would think that.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.720
 - Okay.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.240
 - There's, it's the same operating system basically.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.120
 So it is like, it's like trying to learn,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.040
 like it's like somebody gave me an Amiga basically.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.400
 And like I have to figure out how to do what I do on it,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.240
 which is cool.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.160
 Like there's a touchscreen,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.080
 there are a million icons on every page.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.080
 There's every like, you know, JJOS on the MPC 1000,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.760
 like they started adding all these features.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.840
 Like, you know, recording mutes as you're playing them

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.680
 and stuff like that.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.680
 And it kind of does that by default now.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.200
 Like I was recording my first sequence

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.240
 and was like, this is going fucking crazy.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.080
 What's going on?

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.360
 And then realized like in the system settings,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.480
 mute recording was turned on by default.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.600
 So I realized like every time I muted something,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.320
 it was picking it up in a recording.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.160
 It's like, oh shit, like this is kind of weird.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.480
 - This seems like a cool feature.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.320
 - Yeah.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.560
 - It's something people wanted for the 1000 for years

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.840
 and JJ finally added it.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.080
 So it's like they took every feature on there,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.520
 put it in here, but also put like good effects on top of it.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.480
 And it's like, it can do everything the rack samplers

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.200
 can do like key groups and different like,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.840
 you know, like having, it'll auto sample.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.560
 So you can hook it up to a synthesizer.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.440
 It'll play like C1 note into it sample that,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.640
 trim it to be a perfect pad and then go through

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.880
 the whole octave range depending upon how you set it.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.920
 So you can just play that synth away from the machine.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.120
 They got that feature working and like this operating system.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.960
 - That's amazing.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.800
 - Yeah, that was cool.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.480
 Like that's something I'm gonna try to use.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.480
 So it's got like a lot of promise.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.960
 Every way you could imagine slicing a sample.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.240
 Like recycle style, like you can actually create the slices

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.560
 as the sample plays by hitting the pads

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.400
 and it'll assign that slice to that pad.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.800
 Like it's got crazy shit.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.200
 Like as far as slicing goes, it like they nailed it.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.000
 It's like everything I ever wanted from a rack sampler

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.160
 jammed into here.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.960
 That being said, like it's mad confusing

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.800
 when you turn it on.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.320
 Like, you know, the, I knew the electron stuff

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.720
 and so do we and like you can turn that on

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.560
 and kind of use it.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.600
 This is like, you're gonna sit down with the manual

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.240
 for a while and figure out like,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.760
 how do I make a note like longer than one step?

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.320
 So how is it confusing?

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.800
 Is it too many options?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.120
 Is it an esoteric language?

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.960
 Both.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.880
 Like, so if you know like an NPC

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.240
 and I've had the 2000 back in the 90s

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.840
 and then I had the 1000.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.240
 So you know about like sequences

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.520
 and how they're not like a sequence

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.000
 and it's like a collection of everything

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.120
 and you know about projects and programs

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.760
 and then like tracks within programs.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.720
 It's got all that.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.800
 But it also has this Ableton style clip functionality.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.360
 You get 16 pads with all your track shit on it

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.320
 like normal NPC, but you also have another 16 pads

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.760
 in clip mode where you can just play like Ableton style clips

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.280
 that you record in this thing alongside it.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.960
 So wait, do you switch modes?

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.360
 'Cause you only have the 16 pads.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.360
 It's weird 'cause you go to,

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.440
 it's like a program type is clip.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.400
 And then when you go to that program type and hit edit,

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.040
 you get like all 16 pads.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.480
 You're like in a different mode all of a sudden.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.440
 That's the stuff that'll kind of fuck your head up.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.280
 When you're like, oh shit, I'm somewhere else.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.600
 Like I'm on, you know, you're in a snot Pluto anymore.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.000
 Or like I've got to figure out like what the fuck I'm doing.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.240
 And that's the shit they don't explain very well either.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.720
 Like even in the manual,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.720
 you kind of figure out there are a bunch of different ways

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.000
 you can record stuff.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.200
 Like there's a looper,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.520
 but you have to go through like 10 steps

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.240
 to get the looper to play into one of those clip things.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.920
 Whereas it should just be there,

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.320
 like ready to play you would think if you take a loop.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.520
 So that's a long winded way of saying that you can do like

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.080
 MIDI synced MPC and Ableton style loops that record.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.240
 And then you like automatically have those on a clip,

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.720
 but you have to go through steps to like assign those

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.880
 to the clips, you know what I mean?

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.920
 You can do a lot of things that I wanted to do from this.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.840
 Like I wanted an MPC like I've always had.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.640
 I wanted the ability to stack effects that sound good,

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.760
 which you do and you can automate the fuck out of them

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.920
 and it'll do that.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.320
 MPC 1000 would die when you like automated too many

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.400
 of the effect parameters.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.680
 They also sounded like shit,

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.280
 but it would also just fuck up.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.640
 This handles it, it seems like very well.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.160
 And you get like a CPU meter

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.640
 and that's the only thing you've got a fight against.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.640
 You've got as much ability to fuck this up

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.200
 as you have CPU left over.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.920
 - Do you find yourself hitting that?

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.640
 Like over the course of you working with it,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.520
 what's the range you're hitting?

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.600
 - It's a good point 'cause it seems like they dynamically

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.080
 assign CPU finally in a way that doesn't make it pop and click.

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.160
 Like if you mute things,

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.280
 it seems to reduce the CPU meter basically.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.080
 So that's kind of cool and that if you have a bunch of chains,

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.440
 you can kind of like mute shit

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.200
 and you can get some of that power back.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.880
 - As opposed to playing it and then having muted it.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.720
 - Yeah.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.600
 - But like still allocating resources to it.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.440
 - Exactly.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.480
 Like even if you muted it's still like memory resonance,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.960
 you know it's still gonna be hogging like that CPU

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.800
 and addresses and stuff like that.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.600
 So it's good, it's got like a huge touchscreen.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.040
 You're really working the touchscreen a lot I found.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.280
 I would not want the MPC Live just knowing that they brought

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.680
 all these soft buttons out here that you can do stuff

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.600
 'cause just having to use the touchscreen for all that

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.440
 would kind of suck.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.760
 - Especially in the club.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.680
 - Yeah. - Like you're sweating.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.680
 - This was what was annoying me about the force also.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.520
 - Right.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.200
 - There was a lot of buttons but like there wasn't enough

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.320
 overlap, you know what I mean?

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.560
 Like some stuff you had to use the touchscreen for

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.320
 and that kind of drove me insane.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.520
 - I kind of want the force but like,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.800
 it's like I want some of the functionality

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.920
 that only put on there for the clip stuff

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.600
 and the way they made it easier to get to a recording

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.280
 to a playable clip.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.760
 This has like a layer of abstraction on top of that

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.720
 but the force also like has a synthesizer

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.920
 this doesn't have.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.000
 Like the cool thing, this is the first MPC

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.760
 with like built-in synths and the one like tube synth

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.000
 is just a regular like two-off synth

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.600
 with a bunch of different like, you know,

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.280
 modulators and stuff and it's like, it's okay.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.920
 It's not bad but there's also like one called hype

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.040
 that's only on the force that has wave table stuff

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.480
 that's not on this.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.200
 So it's like, why are you like, are you gonna,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.520
 is that gonna be on here?

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.840
 'Cause they kind of sell it right now

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.960
 as like a force only feature.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.480
 It's like, well, I want the wave table synths

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.320
 like I don't, you know.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.160
 So. - Gotta buy them all Nick.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.240
 - You do but that thing is bigger than a laptop.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.560
 - Yeah, this is enormous.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.320
 - This is already pretty big.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.720
 This is like a fucking computer.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.600
 You can tell it's a Windows embedded computer

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.000
 'cause even when you turn the power off,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.960
 it's like, oh, you wanna shut down.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.360
 Do you wanna save your work first?

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.360
 I'm like, oh, I thought you just turned the fuck off.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.200
 - Force was the same way, yeah, yeah.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.440
 - Like, yeah, it has a boot up, you know.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.600
 - Right, and I can see the vent on the back here.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.120
 Like, this is having actual fan.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.280
 - It gets warm. - Okay.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.720
 - It doesn't have a fan, but the sides are plastic

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.120
 and they're all like completely air exposed.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.600
 So it gets warm.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.280
 It's got MIDI sequencing.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.600
 Like the CV outs I have not tried yet,

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.120
 but I'm super hopeful to like hook it up to my modular

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.800
 and just sequence that.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.040
 But you don't get like an LFO.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.640
 You get like a bunch of like parameter lock knobs

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.480
 you can sign to CVs basically, which is super attractive.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.920
 Like, I'm into that, but you can't like

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.480
 - Peram LFO out of the CV outs or anything like that.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.120
 You're gonna have to do that with a module.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.120
 So, but that's cool, I'm into it.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.360
 Like CV gate pitch, mod wheel,

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.120
 and then just kind of like fuck up two parameters, you know?

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.240
 Like, I'm into that.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.720
 Like two more outputs would have been fucking great.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.560
 Sacrifice the CV outputs

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.040
 and have two more audio outputs.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.040
 There are already people that are like,

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.880
 oh, I hope we can send audio out of the CV outs.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.360
 I'm like, maybe, but they didn't design it that way.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.040
 More MIDI IO, like it was the thing they skimped on

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.760
 that the live has and the X has is like more inputs

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.280
 and outputs.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.840
 They kind of punted on that.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.440
 You can do MIDI over ethernet

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.520
 as of like last week with the last update.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.280
 - You also have actual 5-pin MIDI USB

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.760
 two variations of USB.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.080
 - Yeah, 'cause you can do USB host, which is cool.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.680
 So you can try to keyboard up.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.160
 Haven't tried that yet, but I'll probably try that.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.400
 And the other one's just upgrades

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.680
 and computer integration and stuff like that.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.240
 - It looks nice.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.440
 - It is nice.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.520
 Like you could see like it's hard to notice,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.680
 but there's like the tolerances on the manufacturing.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.600
 There's a bigger gap over here on the screen

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.120
 than there is over here.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.120
 This one's totally flush.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.560
 This is like a 16th of an inch.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.600
 I would say gap on the display.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.600
 You can tell it's as cheap as they could make it

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.080
 and still make it right.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.400
 - It looks like an NPC.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.840
 - Yeah, it looks like an NPC.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.680
 The pads are maybe the shittiest ones

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.880
 I've ever had on an NPC.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.360
 Like the NPC 1000 pads were not great.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.600
 You had to buy like replacements.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.760
 These are okay.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.200
 I like that they light up and have different colors.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.680
 It's nice to like organize that.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.080
 You can see the velocity difference.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.160
 Like all green is low and the red is high.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.520
 Some of that shit's cool.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.920
 The effects sound good.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.880
 It sounds great.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.680
 These NPCs are not known for their effects.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.400
 So what's new?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.440
 - The NPC 1000 was like a joke as far as the effects go.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.440
 They sounded like shit.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.000
 You were never getting updates.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.520
 This actually has effects from a Kai

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.120
 and from this company Air.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.360
 And it turns out this company Air

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.600
 does all the effects for Pro Tools that are by default.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.960
 And those sound pretty good.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.240
 - Are they like utility effects?

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.600
 - Yeah, but some of them are nice.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.080
 You get like, there are tons of them.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.320
 You get like 20 different delays.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.600
 And it's like a ping pong delay

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.080
 and then a stereo ping pong delay.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.840
 And that's one with like a band pass filter.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.280
 Like they did a good job at adding a lot more effects

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.040
 than I've ever seen on an NPC where that was kind of a joke

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.320
 unless you bought like an expansion card

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.200
 or something like that.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.880
 - So in each of those are the parameters automatable?

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.720
 - Yes.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.560
 - Oh, that's nice.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.400
 - That's a nice feature.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.280
 You can automate the shit out of everything.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.200
 So you get like these four knobs on the side

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.520
 and these are the Q-Link ones

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.280
 and then you hit this button to kind of page

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.760
 through the different pages for effects.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.000
 I've run into one incident so far

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.760
 and I'm on the latest OS where the Q-Link thing

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.400
 that hovers over the parameters went away

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.600
 and I had to like manually assign the knobs.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.480
 It was one like bug I ran into.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.120
 I haven't reproduced it since, but you could tell it was like,

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.240
 okay, this thing's gonna be like kind of flaky, you know?

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.920
 Like it's not perfect.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.480
 But you are an early adopter.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.320
 - Yeah.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.120
 Oh yeah, no, this has only been out for a couple of months.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.640
 The OS is supposed to be robust

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.160
 but this is the first time it's used on this machine.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.960
 - How's it function slave?

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.800
 Maybe try it again.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.960
 - I have not yet.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.800
 I've only had it mastered so far.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.560
 So I've got to try like that's the next thing.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.080
 I set it up last night in the studio

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.880
 before I kind of tore it down to bring it here

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.920
 and like that's the next step.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.160
 But as a master, like I ran it for hours

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.480
 with sampling stuff and it was just running away.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.280
 Timing seemed great, like no issues.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.120
 - That's cool.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:29.960
 - Yeah.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.200
 So I'm hopeful.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.120
 It's a nice size.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.800
 I'd like to run like kind of a set with this in the rhythm

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.760
 and maybe small modular rig.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.040
 It's kind of where I'm at right now, but we'll see.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.960
 (electronic music)

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.880
 (electronic music)

00:23:46.880 --> 00:24:01.880
 - I hope these stuff should I talk about?

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.720
 - Let's see.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.320
 I mean, the things you have in Triplekit

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.680
 is probably a good starting part.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.520
 - Yeah.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.360
 (laughing)

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.200
 - I forgot to.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.880
 - That wasn't like that last episode.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.200
 - No, you're right.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.800
 - That is a newer change.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.480
 Yeah, I'll talk about that a little bit.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.160
 So I got rid of my factory,

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.040
 my mutual instruments factory versions of grids and rings

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.480
 and replaced them with a knock off,

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.280
 a clone, so to speak.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.160
 Little controversial, I know.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.280
 But it saved me a lot of space.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.280
 I was able to fit almost three clone rings

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.000
 into the space where I had one factory rings

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.720
 and I was able to fit exactly two grids

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.320
 into the space where I had one factory grids.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.880
 So it was helpful for me to compact things down

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.000
 and get more functionality in the same amount of space.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.840
 Yeah, I don't know how I feel about it myself.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.040
 I feel a little guilty for doing it.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.880
 Also, just the company that seems to be all they do

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.960
 is just kind of whip up smaller sized versions

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.480
 of the mutable stuff and that's kind of

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.680
 like their whole business model.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.120
 The company was called MoMo Modular.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.680
 Maybe it's MooMoo, I don't know how it's pronounced,

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.680
 but really cool people, they cut me a deal

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.560
 for buying multiples, which was nice

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.320
 and also saved me on the shipping.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.000
 They have a website, but I was doing all the dealings

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.960
 through Reverb, they have a store shop on there.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.480
 But it's interesting, yeah, I don't know how I feel

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.280
 about it, the knobs are tinier, little cramped, obviously.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.400
 But I mean, to get that size though,

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.200
 those are tremendously smaller

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.840
 than the original form factor.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.960
 Half the size.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.800
 Is it really half?

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.640
 Exactly, half.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.200
 Yeah, I fit two of those in the exec space

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.200
 where I had one factory.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.040
 Yeah.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.640
 Man, if we could make rubberized,

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.440
 really small knobs like that that would go over

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.280
 those type, that would be awesome.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.120
 Yeah, that would be awesome.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:13.960
 'Cause they're pain in the ass.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.000
 Like you said earlier, it's kind of like that.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.680
 You can't go from one to 10 smoothly,

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.480
 you've gotta go one to eight.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.080
 Yeah, fuck.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.760
 Like the Pittsburgh Voltage Lab,

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.800
 all the CB inputs are the mini pots

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.160
 and that's the main thing that's like, ah, fuck.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.560
 I feel like there are things where that sort of course

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.560
 and this is fine.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.840
 Yeah.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.320
 But I mean, there's stuff you really wanna dial into.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.640
 There were patches live that I wanted to change the

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.840
 CB input potentiometer on and I was like,

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.440
 this is kind of shitty right now.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.480
 Like I couldn't dial it in.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.000
 Like I've got tiny fucking alien hands too.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.120
 Like I don't like, it's generally not a problem,

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.880
 but that was a problem.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.480
 I mean, as someone who has literally

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.800
 the exact opposite problem.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.640
 Yeah, I feel you do.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.520
 We have sausage fingers.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.080
 Plus I keep having these issues where my joints swell.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.400
 I don't know if I'm getting fucking arthritis or what.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.840
 Yeah, I got that too.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.840
 It's nice.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.840
 Yeah, but I do have a full row of mutable stuff now.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.760
 And I feel like I've given mutable quite a bit of cash

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.600
 over the years.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.440
 Oh fuck yeah.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.400
 And you know, so I don't feel quite so bad

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.360
 of phasing out some of the factory versions

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.480
 with the clones.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.280
 And I still have plenty of factory models too.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.280
 So two factory plates over there, three factory marbles.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.760
 So.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.160
 Oh, I know it's Magpie, I should cut you a check.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.000
 Yeah.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.120
 I have a lot of Magpie panels now.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.560
 Everything that I could swap the black

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.240
 has been swapped to black with the exception

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.280
 of the Chaos devices stuff.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.560
 On my 7U, I'm down to three modules.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.960
 I know I've got two or three

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.680
 and it's gonna be a fucking pain, man.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.080
 Chilling me.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.760
 As far as, like even beyond the aesthetics of it,

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.280
 I just love being able to see white labeling

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.120
 on a black panel.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.760
 Yeah, it's so much easier to see.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.680
 Especially in a dark room or a club, you know.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.920
 I don't, this is the dumbest thing,

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.400
 but it like calms me down to you.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.760
 I don't know why, but like just to look at a black panel,

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.680
 I'm like, ah, like it, it, the simplicity of it.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.080
 It is like a black and white world.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.680
 Want everything to be?

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.840
 Cray scale.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.680
 Yeah.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.120
 But yeah, the Chaos device stuff is next.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.680
 I, I don't know, like a blush response.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.200
 I noticed lately he's been digging on the Odessa.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.040
 Oh, okay.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.760
 He's been posting a lot of like Instagram videos of it.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.160
 And I'm like, cool.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.600
 His is black.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.320
 And I'm crazy jealous of him.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.280
 But I have no idea where he got the black panel from.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.400
 Cause like, I've, all the retailers in the States

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.680
 don't have it.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.760
 I hit up Chaos devices and they said,

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.600
 oh, they're available.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.440
 Talk to your retailers.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.320
 I'm like, where?

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.080
 Cause like no one here has them yet.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:45.920
 I take it.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.080
 You still like the Odessa?

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:47.920
 I love it.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.920
 Yeah.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.880
 I like the whole look and the interface of it.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.280
 That was one of the main reasons why I bought it.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.400
 Like I've, I've been kind of fiendin' for a complex oscillator.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.000
 You know, I mean, there's a few modules out there

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.720
 that don't do the exact same thing,

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.520
 but it gets you into weird complex oscillator territories

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.800
 and whatever.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.280
 I wasn't too happy with a lot of them.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.280
 The interfaces, not the sound.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.280
 Yeah.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.480
 I mean, like sound wise, if I could pick any just based on sound,

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.280
 it would probably be a heard stone at Mark 3.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.920
 Fantastic fucking module.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.880
 However, I kind of don't like how Scott crammed so much

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.000
 functionality into that little menu system.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.720
 And, you know, I mean, bounce in between what oscillator

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.720
 and what mode you're working on, things like that.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.720
 Yeah.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.880
 I wanted everything to be upfront.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.960
 And everything is with the address.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.360
 There's no menus, there's no hidden anything.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.000
 It's just all upfront, everything's accessible.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.800
 I'm pretty happy with the sound.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.120
 My only complaint is the fact that you can't get rid

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.440
 of the fundamental frequency on the harmonic outs.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.120
 Oh, even odd.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.200
 It's always present.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.120
 Even though there's a dedicated fundamental out,

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.560
 it's also present on the other two even odd outputs.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.560
 Yeah.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.760
 Well, they said they basically couldn't do it easily.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:09.520
 So people have been asking that maybe it'll happen in a future update.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.480
 They were very clear in saying they feel that the Odessa is done,

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.800
 the firmware is filled, and it would be a pain and he asked to update

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.280
 and they don't want it to ever really need to be updated.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.960
 So they're kind of considering a closed book at this point,

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.760
 which is a little disappointing.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.160
 And it actually encouraged a bit of an argument on the muff forums

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.000
 I noticed there was people arguing with them,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.560
 because they were saying basically because of the chipset,

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.760
 it can't be updated.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.560
 And there was people pointing out that, like, that's poor shit.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.360
 You can sell the chip.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.560
 There's always an option, basically.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.360
 So yeah, it started a little bit of controversy,

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.560
 because I'm not the only one who has also been, I guess,

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.160
 disappointed with the fact that you can't get rid of the fundamental.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.760
 Also, as a Zadar owner, their update isn't going to fucking work.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.760
 Yeah.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.760
 Straight up.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.760
 There's that too.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.960
 So yeah, maybe it was a lesson learned with the Zadar.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.960
 And they don't want to really just try to update anything.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:15.160
 But no, for the moment, like, I haven't had too much time to dive into the Odessa

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.160
 or the R-Bar, which are the two big ones that I've gotten recently.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.160
 I just haven't been in the vibe.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.160
 I've been mainly working on percussion stuff lately.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:32.160
 I've been getting way more into, like, the physical modeling stuff and rings

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.160
 and being able to run things into rings.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.160
 It was nice in that regard.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:45.160
 Buying cycles, rather, was more like a goal I had for live performance.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.160
 Right.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:51.160
 I wanted a drum machine that was digital, versatile, and yet not overly complicated

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.160
 to do some FM's type stuff.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.160
 You know, I mean, something that I could replicate some of what I do in the

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.160
 modular in a drum machine.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:06.160
 And originally, I was on the market to get back a Nord drum too.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.160
 Oh, okay.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160
 Because I miss mine.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.160
 Yeah.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.160
 But it's like impossible to get one now.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.160
 It's been a while.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.160
 It's been a while.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.160
 I remember you having one.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.160
 Yeah.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.160
 But that was a while ago now.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.160
 It was.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.160
 It was.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.160
 Yeah.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.160
 Well, yeah, I sold the Nord drum because I had started doing all my FM drum stuff

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.160
 in the modular.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.160
 Yeah.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.160
 Now, I don't want to bring my modular out for live stuff.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.160
 So it's like, how do I get FM drum stuff live?

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.160
 Right around the timeframe when I was thinking about pulling the trigger on a Nord

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:42.160
 drum, because there was one posted up on Muff, but then the cycles came out and I said,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.160
 well, fuck it.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.160
 I'll give that a shot.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:50.700
 $100, yeah can't really like is it as fun as the plats is for like FM drum stuff

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:57.420
 No now I still prefer plates. Yeah, yeah, it's as close to a plates drum machine that I've found so far

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:02.200
 Yeah, you know what I mean? especially because it's all like macro based you you know, I mean like

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.240
 So wait before we get too far

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.620
 Do you wanna give a sort of overview high-level?

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:13.420
 Description of cycles and sort of like ease a little listener into this. Yeah. I'm referring to the new

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.420
 FM drum machine

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:22.820
 Electron cycles not to be confused with the Indian bike shop of the same name

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.220
 That Google keeps trying to send me to

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:30.020
 Tell you what those guys probably have never seen this much website traffic

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.980
 They're like, why are we what do we do with our adding a smart right now?

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:40.340
 It's even spelled the same way like with the K electron cycles. Yeah, holy shit exact same spelling and like yeah

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.340
 So they've been bumped up to like the number one result on Google now

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:47.760
 But this is the electron model cycles, so

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:52.700
 But yeah, it's a FM based drum machine

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.740
 I

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:59.020
 Guess you could use it as a sense if you really wanted to it's not really set up for that, you know

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.820
 But you get six

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.420
 Models or machines rather that you can set up for track in any order

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:12.100
 You get kick snare metal perk tone and chord

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:19.900
 So those you can consider that like your macros, you know like you put on a plats or braids

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:23.380
 You know, it's a starting point

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:30.340
 We originally decided that the Digitone was a preset box back when it was first announced. Yeah

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:36.340
 This is definitely a preset box like a hundred percent. We went too early. We did. Yeah

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:43.020
 The Digitone is a box full of experimental potential compared to the cycles

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:49.220
 It is very limited. Well, there's a ton of presets isn't like 500 or something

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:56.140
 Fucking epic tonic. Yeah, you can store 60,000 or something like that. It's like 90,000. Yeah, oh Jesus

00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:03.580
 Yeah, they said theoretically it's like infinite, but like they noticed that things would probably start to fuck up for you around 90k

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:13.340
 But in my opinion, there's no way in hell you're even gonna make a fraction of that because the thing is so limited in scope per

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:20.580
 Machine you're not gonna have that much deviation to warrant a lot of presets

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:25.260
 You know, I mean like you they have a shit ton of kick drum presets and they're already for example

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:31.780
 All of them are just marginally different, you know, they all have the same like kind of basic sound

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.900
 They all still sound like you're using the kick drum machine

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.180
 You're not gonna really make your kick drum machine sound like the metal machine

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:44.220
 It's not that open-ended like on a Digitone. What are you changing if you can change it at all?

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:50.580
 It's a little nebulous like they're all worded the same on the panel, but they're doing different things per machine

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.540
 They have like contour exactly. You got like contour shape

00:35:54.540 --> 00:36:00.580
 Color, but you don't have like individual operator and modulator. No, sir. No, sir at all. That's a new me

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:08.660
 Yeah, I mean the entire basis of FM is to have these modulators and carriers and that's completely hidden from you

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.660
 Yes

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:19.380
 You're not doing FM synthesis on this missing you're tweaking a handful of parameters that are locked into a very small variety of

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.220
 you know

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.820
 sonic

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.260
 differences

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.940
 You're not

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.580
 Getting into like the root of the FM synthesis or anything like that

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.780
 Because even on the and like there's no way you could dial one machine really to sound like another

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.740
 It's not that versatile like if you're using the kick machine you're locked into the kick machine and the little

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:45.820
 Variances that you can do with it. You want something to sound metallic. You're gonna have to load the metal machine

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:52.820
 You know I mean things like that you're not gonna have this wide range this this palette like you would on like a Digitone where you could

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:57.940
 Shape, you know things this be different. So you can load different ones per track

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:03.460
 Yeah, you can load any like if you want all six tracks to be the kick machine. Yeah, you can do that

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:10.340
 You can arrange them in any order on any track that is one of the big pros for this thing in my opinion that you're not

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:15.100
 Locked in per track, right? Yeah, like like you are on most drum machines

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.580
 We're like yeah, you're like fuck if I only had one more

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:22.660
 Kick and I would get rid of the rim shot so I can have another fucking kick machine

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:26.940
 You know me it won't let me do that right you can on this and that's a huge bonus

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:34.100
 I think that's one of the smartest choices they made with this thing was the flexibility of that and there's a few other things that I

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.100
 Thought really make it stand out

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:41.540
 Like I did not foresee myself buying another electron device anytime soon

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.740
 this one kind of pulled me back in and

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:49.980
 I don't regret the decision like after spending some time with it. I like it. It's certainly limited

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:57.180
 I think a lot of people are going to be making things that sound the same with it. Yeah, you know what I mean

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:00.440
 It's gonna take someone who's really into the machine to

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.660
 Find a way to make it sound unique

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:08.580
 I'm just president have a machine that was just like to op and it's just like carrier modulator

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:15.260
 Infinite flexibility like you can get two of these things to modulate each other and help with sound the closest to that

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:21.900
 Leasten my messing around with it is the tone machine. Okay. I've my two favorites are a tone and perk

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.900
 I feel like those you can kind of

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.700
 Get a little more versatile with

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:36.340
 My least favorite surprisingly is the snare and the metal. Hmm. Oh why sounds like shit

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.980
 It sounds like shit. That was one of the main reasons why I bought this thing

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.300
 I was like that's fucking cool. It has a whole mode dedicated to it, but it is

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:50.980
 Super limited and it just does not sound that good. All right. Um, it's meant to be used as like symbols, you know

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:58.060
 Sure, right, right. Um, but I feel like it doesn't even do symbols that well let alone being able to do the weird

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:03.500
 Disident shit that I tend to pull out of FM things like the BIA and even right in plates

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:08.820
 From what I was reading or I'm sorry. I didn't read it. It was a it was a interview

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:15.260
 I think at I think it was that perfect circuit with the guy who made this thing and he was talking a bit about the metal machine

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:18.900
 He was saying originally he wanted to emulate the machine drum

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:25.500
 Yeah, hi hat, which is right. Okay, but in my mind. I hear that and I'm like, oh, they should just put the machine

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.300
 I'm high-high on it right well

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:32.300
 That's kind of what he was trying to do and he said originally he was told that that was just like I think a two-up

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:37.820
 Yeah thing and he said he tried as hard as he could to get it using two-up

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:41.820
 And then it turns out it's actually not there was some weird shit that they had going on with it

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:44.140
 That it was like an eight-op type of thing. Oh shit

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.020
 Yeah, so he had to like come up with a fancy way to make it that as

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.380
 It is currently

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:56.620
 And it's cool, but it could definitely be better. Yeah, or at the very least a little more versatile, you know

00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:02.100
 It just sounds kind of like a bad analog crash symbol

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:06.140
 Right, you know like even at its best point you can do some hats with it

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:11.260
 But I find I feel like doing using some of the other machines. I've been able to dial in better hats

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:18.580
 So yeah, the metal machine was pretty disappointing all of these presets like if you set the envelope or you you

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.060
 huh envelope

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.060
 What envelope?

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:30.220
 That's another part of it is you don't get anything like that. No ADSR all you have is decay and

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:38.900
 Not even a sec. So that is on my cons list. It's like I didn't even realize I was wandering into a con. Yeah

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.900
 Wow, so it's a drum machine

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.380
 with no envelopes

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.860
 Oh, you get a decay and the decay itself is kind of like me, but that's

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:54.940
 Yeah, all you can do to even like try to get like an attack is to rig up the LFO

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:59.660
 No, that's what they always try to fuck you. You do and yet you only get one LFO

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:06.900
 Yeah, then you're locked in there. You have no modulation except for parameter locking at that point

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:11.460
 I don't think if you've to goddamn LFO is like just I tell you what that yeah, that was the number one

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.260
 Well, no, there's the two biggest

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:22.100
 Complaints I had about this thing was a you're locked to one LFO and be only one stereo output what yeah

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.740
 That's a relation my opinion. It's huge oversight

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:31.500
 I mean you can hard-pan them and you could parameter lock the panning if you wanted to try to create some sort of weird stereo space

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:39.060
 Yeah, exactly like who's that would just be so tedious for such a basic fucking thing

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.060
 You know

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:48.180
 But yeah, that's my top two complaints because the effects are not that great. They're very limited and they're global

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:51.900
 So the reverb and the delay sends are not per track

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:56.220
 They're global and they don't sound that great like the never move away from that shit

00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:00.900
 Yeah, I'm convinced that the delay the only options you get is time and feedback

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.860
 the reverb the only options you get is tone and size and

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:10.820
 So yeah, I'll very limited and so you're like well fuck it. It's limited right, you know

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.180
 I'll just I'll effect externally

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.780
 Not gonna happen if you only have one stereo fucking help

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:22.660
 But the your only option at that point especially for like a live performance perspective is the hard pan

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.900
 Left right and break it, you know like

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.460
 Basically

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.660
 And I was already thinking of how to do this for my live setup

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:37.020
 I wanted I was gonna split the chance the tracks in half have the you know first three har pan left is

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:42.740
 second three har pan right right would be going to like the modular for yeah reverb and

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:47.780
 Gran your granular processing the left would be going through distortion shit like that

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:56.100
 But it's just a bummer that like yeah at least one extra stereo set which you could then do like a four channel mono

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.580
 setup of processing would be

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.380
 Fine even two channels this NPC has four stereo effects per pad

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:10.860
 So it's like very different ballgame than many of the electron devices. So yeah, it's it's got some good things going for it and it's got

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.220
 some bad so

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:19.660
 Like right now what's the Vegas odds on you having one when we come back to record the next episode

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:26.220
 I don't see myself getting rid of it. Okay, like for 300 bucks. It's a cool little drum machine sure and I can dial in some stuff

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.500
 That's fun

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:34.380
 That I can now fuck with live and not have to bring out my entire modular drum machine to do

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:41.620
 So yeah, I don't see a gun anywhere, but at the same time like I don't see it getting much use in the studio

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:47.640
 Right like this is probably gonna be just a fun toy to use live or you know, it's super lightweight

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:54.500
 It's super cheap. I can save everything to presets. You know me. Yeah, it'll function for what it needs to be live

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.020
 It's just too limited in my opinion to really

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:06.060
 You know program with it in the studio. I would yeah, I'll just use my modular or any other device really right right

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:10.260
 So yeah, when I'm not preparing to do a live show, it's probably gonna be collecting dust

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:14.180
 But it is cool because it's got

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:20.500
 All the probability stuff built in. Oh, that's cool. It also has resolution per

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:25.900
 Track yeah, so you can have things going at different time signatures different lengths

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.860
 So you can get kind of complex in that way

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:32.340
 You're just not gonna be getting too complex sonically

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:37.660
 You know, I mean you're gonna be working within the confines of those machines or macros whatever you want to call them

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:46.260
 And you can do some scinthe stuff with the cord and the tone machines. They're like yeah for that basically

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:52.260
 Again without an envelope though. It's just gonna be yeah a little strange

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:57.580
 You're gonna be doing little like plucky percussion, you know little FM leap lops

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:00.820
 Which is cool because that's what I wanted to know

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:06.220
 For the most part it just sucks that I wouldn't be able to expand upon it a little bit with this and the model samples

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:09.060
 They couldn't have made them look more generic in my opinion

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:12.380
 There's like this like oh they look like shit beige like yeah

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.940
 They wanted to make it look like a pill or something like that

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:21.740
 It's like the most generic thing possible. Yeah weird devoid of branding like and like it has this weird sort of like like it

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.740
 They didn't lean into any sort of like retro vibe. No, it's just

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.500
 office computer. Yeah

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:34.300
 And they supplied some stickers with it and they even have some retro like old-school computer

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:39.660
 graphics on it like you can't even read the ones that are supposed to be words like

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.620
 this made me laugh because

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.700
 They literally look like shit

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.580
 Like not like aesthetically like shit, but like literal shit. I'll show you hang tight. Oh

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:57.540
 You mean the font is shit. Oh, what stuff this is somebody smearing shit or actually just what?

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.880
 Those colons do those or do those not look like turds. Yeah

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.180
 Yeah

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:10.740
 Intestines and poop. Yeah, I don't know. What the fuck just like blobby, right? It just looks like a little pal dog shit

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.740
 I don't get stunned right now

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:21.460
 Right I was cracking up when I unboxed it. I said what the fuck is that because the rest of it has like a very like 8-bit vibe

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.020
 and then there's shit and

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.700
 which I

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.860
 Don't know what's supposed to be I have no idea

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:35.340
 But there it is. That's the stickers. That's how you make your little ugly box not look so ugly is my covering it and shit

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:40.700
 Stickers there's that big beige gap at the top and I'm assuming all that text right there will fit into that

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:46.980
 Otherwise, it's pointless, right? Like it does not fit there. Not at all. That fucking blows my mind right there

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:52.940
 You cannot fit this sticker on there at all without and this is what the dude who made it did you pull the knobs off

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:57.860
 You line it up you cut holes in the sticker and then you can align it around

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:06.380
 Does sound amie quitting life. Yeah, that's a low-grade style flipping here. Yes. I don't know like there's some really good choices here and

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:11.820
 You know and then there's some really questionable ones. What the

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:19.020
 I'm so confused. I cannot tell if I love or hate this machine. Yeah, but theater box like it's kind of hard to fuck with

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:24.460
 That's the thing you know, it's 300 bucks like I know I'm going to get my 300 bucks worth out of it

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.460
 So fine so be it

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.980
 There's a couple little things in there that I like to like if you

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:36.140
 You if you make and save a preset and then you load it up and you start changing values

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:41.860
 Underneath the value that you're changing. It shows you what your preset value is. Oh, the original value, right? Yeah

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.940
 Yeah, all this is all the time. Yes, that's and that's a nice little touch

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:49.540
 Yeah, I saw that and I was like cool, you know at first I didn't realize what the little number was and I was like what the fuck is it?

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:53.300
 And I was like oh that's my original value. It's like dope, you know, that's very useful

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:59.020
 Especially when you're trying to make like a kit, you know, and you just want to like deviate from a little bit from your last I

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.500
 Felt that was a nice touch

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:10.220
 It's knob per function, which is also nice. That is cool. If it wasn't I probably wouldn't have bought it

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:19.300
 Right, no menus. Right really. I'm really is it 12 knobs? 12 knobs. Yeah, 12 knobs knob per function that as little as that is

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:26.380
 That's fucking huge for me. You know, I mean, that's one reason why I've been deviating from electronic over the last few years is too much shit

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:30.900
 For one fucking knob, you know too much menu diving. I'm not into that at all

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:36.140
 Especially for something like this where you just want to dial in a quick drum sound. Yeah, yeah

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:39.740
 But yeah limited on the menu diving

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:44.620
 That's

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:46.060
 That's about it

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.660
 As far as good things go we've never done this. I really sound think we've done this

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.700
 If you had to give this thing a great

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:58.540
 Like out of what like this typical sort of school like a

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:02.020
 CD it's a C for sure. Yeah, okay

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:09.420
 Definitely a C because it's a passing grade it passes exactly. There's nothing that really makes it stand out

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:15.300
 Sound wise or even function wise. That's like mind-blowing or new

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:22.160
 Or even that good like it sounds mediocre. So this is definitely being phys ed

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:30.500
 Where I gotta see you're showing up and dressing got it you get it you get the participation award even the bus response demo

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:36.220
 I'm like cool. This is the first good sounds I've heard but also I could hear like when you drive this thing

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:41.900
 It sounds a certain way just like the analog rhythm does but like obviously God that distortion kind of sounds like shit

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:46.540
 Yeah, there's on board distortion if you turn the volume I think it's past 50% or something like that

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.100
 You start to slowly get into this weird overdrive

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:55.980
 Area per track and did you attack had a separate overdrive all together? Yes, this ain't bad

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:59.340
 I mean it it'll crunch it up if that's what you're going for great

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:03.420
 But it's not like a character that you're gonna aim for yeah

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:09.300
 And it's kind of bad in the sense that there's no other way to mix your tracks

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:15.580
 You don't have a filter per channel and that overdrive is your volume per track

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.980
 So if you're cranking a channel you can't I was gonna have a separate game

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:23.580
 No, you can't crank up this and then turn down the gains like once you do that

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:28.060
 This is now a dominant feature of your mess. Oh that is gonna be

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:32.220
 Overwriting everything else so your only option at that point is to bring up everything else

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:37.500
 That was the nice thing about the digit attack having track volume gain and overdrive all being separate

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:45.940
 Yeah dial all that in and the rhythm and the analog before had that too where it's like gain and overdrive right right? Yeah, there's no differentiating here

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:52.780
 Differentiating between the like volume distortion you're either like at a normal volume level or you're cranking it

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:58.700
 And now you've entered their distortion feature and it's like yeah, so it's really hard to

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:03.140
 Mix like so I've been actually avoiding the on-board distortion

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:09.300
 Just keeping the volume at like a normal like 50 yeah, and then you know routing it through distortion externally

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.580
 But I could tell when I heard your sample that you posted

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:17.700
 I'm like oh someone finally like figured out the gain stage on it because everybody else was just like crushing it internally

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.540
 Yeah, it sounded like shit it does

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:25.380
 That knows there any indication that that's what's happening that because if someone's given a volume knob

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:29.580
 They may not know the past noon is when you're going in overdrive

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:34.740
 I mean it says it'll show it shows a little waveform when you adjust the track level

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:39.700
 It at first it's a clean sign and then it starts to get jagged after you skit like a 50%

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:44.580
 I think there's a little arrow on the it's like a dotted volume line

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:50.540
 And I think that little dotted arrow is like you know unity, but yeah the gain station is pretty weird

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.500
 You want to keep it low or else it just starts to get you know

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:57.980
 I was keeping it low and then going through my drawn analog

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.420
 Amplifier module and then I was routing it that way

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:06.740
 I was like giving it boost on that much sounds a lot better than the game. We have a motherboard. We're module

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:13.300
 Okay, joy analog company. Yes. It's all the way on the right there. It's just like a I don't think we've talked about it though

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:18.380
 It's just and just an amplifier left right or AB balanced

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:22.480
 gain and it saturates pretty good if you crank it

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:27.820
 Sounds nice. They've made a few pretty cool modules recently to our analog like some analog filters

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.660
 I think and some other stuff

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:34.460
 Yeah, I think those be sticking around it's just I don't want to say I'm disappointed with it

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.340
 It is what it is. Yeah, nothing more. Yeah, nothing less

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:41.060
 You know what I mean? Like if people buy this thinking they're gonna unlock

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:47.780
 You know something behind the scenes, you know find the the hidden in between sounds and sweet spots

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:52.420
 Good luck cuz it really isn't any that's pretty much everything about that

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.660
 cycles that I had at least I

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:58.100
 Thought we had a question I had about cycles

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:02.100
 Well, let's hear it Dave. I had it was a great. I mean you're

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:09.020
 I've never known anyone to mess with FM as much as you do. Yeah, I had a lot of questions about that. Yeah

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.500
 No, it's lost the time. I should have wrote it down. I

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:20.020
 Got a varigate again, and it's awesome. Very nice varigate eight. Yeah black this time

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:23.860
 Yeah, the dude had black panel. I thought it was a different module at first

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:28.980
 I was like what the fuck is that sequence? So it's a very good eight. Okay, cool. That was what I was looking for

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.040
 It's great for real-time programming. Yeah

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:38.060
 Has most of the same quirks that I remember like just kind of deficiencies with it, but uh, it's pretty rad

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.180
 I like it

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.140
 So just a recap

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.500
 What had you gotten rid of it for in the past?

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.460
 Then we talked about on on the podcast

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:47.060
 But it's been a while it might have been the vector in the past

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:52.180
 And then I kind of moved on from that to the MIDI box and was just kind of thrashing with sequencers in general

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:54.820
 And then I realized that the varigate eight is still a nice like

00:53:54.820 --> 00:54:02.700
 slider driven very real-time kind of sequencer for a modular and that's what I like about it like the I thought you swapped it for the

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:09.220
 The hermod. Oh, yeah, no, I'd eventually got the vector for the hermod

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:14.380
 Sold the hair mod again because that was again like way too menu driven for me

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:19.860
 It was cool. Oh not to derail the conversation, but did you see that square up?

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:24.940
 Is releasing that that rampler? Oh, yeah, the rampler. It looks fucking good

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:31.620
 It's like a multi voice synthesizer sampler module for your Iraq, which seems to be pretty like capable

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:36.820
 Yeah, I was curious about that because they were teasing it right when I was like getting rid of the hair mod

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:40.980
 And I was curious to see what the fuck they were gonna do with that. I'm kind of into it

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:45.180
 It's low latency. It seems like they kind of like said like oh, let's do the tip top one

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:49.580
 But actually give you some ability to fuck with the thing and have like six of them or something like that at the same time

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:54.620
 So I was trying to figure out what I wanted to pair with the flux

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:58.880
 percussion oh shit sequencer be a good

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:05.580
 That or the assimilator which is like three times the price. Yeah, that's which is like too much for what I need

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:10.520
 I don't want to get into that deep of sampling on the modular of determined

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:16.960
 But the rampster looks like a nice middle ground right right looks more appealing than like the oh that sample

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:23.340
 This the slample slample. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it looks like a nice middle ground between like that

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:29.060
 You know that angle and something as crazy as the assimilate. Yeah

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:31.700
 Because it seemed to have some real-time

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:34.180
 CV options and some good like control

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.940
 whereas the

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.940
 Squid sample was kind of weak in that regard. It was like bit rate cut off tune like yeah

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:45.040
 Yeah, and it had like shared

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:53.220
 Yeah, no hubs and pitch and stuff for yeah, that was weak. Yeah. Sorry. I didn't mean to derail that just pop back in my head for all

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.220
 Yeah, yeah

00:55:55.220 --> 00:56:04.460
 Verigate very very good. Yeah, which is cool. I'm glad to have it back. Yeah, yeah

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:08.060
 Vergates nice man. So how are you using it now?

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:12.260
 Not even a bag. I was using it mostly in the context of that live set and to have like

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:16.620
 Sequences that kind of repeated but you know would vary which it's very good for

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:23.900
 And it was nice it was like it's so fast and especially I realized they had a bunch of updates recently to like let you

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:31.380
 Copy patterns over and kind of work with different variations of patterns a little more easily and I was super into it

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:33.780
 I'm still like it's the way I like to

00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:38.900
 program modular sequences right now because I was using the MIDI box before and that's like

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:43.980
 Very different way to go about programming a sequence on a device like that and

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.660
 Yeah, very good has all those gate outs

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.140
 and it was just like

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:54.500
 Working well with the 301 and for what I was going to do and then like the preset recall kind of playing to that whole vibe

00:56:54.500 --> 00:57:00.660
 It was nice to have like oh I can easily navigate banks and presets and have like a hundred of these fucking things really quickly

00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:05.380
 No glove lost. I mean I can't see myself selling it again. Oh nice

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:09.180
 Yeah, as far as sequencers going your Iraq. That's kind of the one that

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:12.580
 Makes the most sense to me right now. Yeah

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:18.900
 So yeah, it was mostly just controlling the voltage lab and the 301 live because it was really easy to um

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:24.900
 Just kind of let the voltage lab at a certain tuning and let it be in tune hopefully and then the 301

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:28.740
 I was like calling up quick saves which is like preset format and it was really um

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:31.620
 I was really caning the fuck out of there.

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:37.360
 Two, four, and ADOP FM, since, within the 301 now that some dude made.

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.660
 Shout out Joe and the 301 for them.

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:41.040
 And they're just like, they're fun as fuck.

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:44.740
 You can modulate the shit out of every parameter and it was trashy.

00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.420
 It was making great sounds.

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:47.420
 So what are they?

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:53.260
 They're called XO, which is one modulator and one carrier, and then XOXO, and then

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:58.900
 XOXOXO, which were the however many operators, but it was just a nice way to have like

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:03.820
 sine wave based like FM synthesis with preset recall and you can modulate like any of the

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:07.860
 fucking parameters, like the amount that it's modulating the other operators and kind of

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.620
 like cross modulate those.

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:10.620
 And that was the real gold.

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:16.820
 And I was like, okay, like I can instantiate these, make a few little tweaks, save a preset,

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:19.020
 then go on the next thing and have it saved.

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.780
 That's fucking awesome.

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:26.780
 Yeah, yeah, that plus the voltage lab was like a nice combination for our lives.

00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:30.380
 Said to have some sort of recall as long as I didn't touch the tune knob on the voltage

00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:31.380
 lab.

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:36.060
 That was the hardest part is I realized like, oh, I have to like tune these things and

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.580
 yeah, fuck that live.

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.660
 Like that's what digital is for right now.

00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:43.300
 Is there anything else anybody wanted to talk about?

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:46.300
 You didn't talk about the flux much, did you?

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:52.280
 It's like temporal rhythmic, depression, sequencer or something.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280
 Yeah.

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.900
 It's got a big name, Dave.

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:56.200
 I don't remember what it is.

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.740
 You lost me a temporal.

00:58:58.740 --> 00:58:59.740
 Temporal, I think.

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:00.740
 I think I'm giving you a hunger.

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:01.740
 That's in the name, right?

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:02.740
 Yeah.

00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:03.740
 Temporal.

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:04.740
 For high notes.

00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:08.620
 And this was a Kickstarter that greatly exceeded its goal.

00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:09.620
 Yeah.

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:12.540
 In one day, it like kind of blew up.

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:17.580
 I didn't even notice it on muffin first, like they posted about it and I just saw the word

00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:20.940
 flux and I thought it was the old thread for the flux.

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:21.940
 Yeah.

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:22.940
 Yeah.

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:25.620
 Getting re-bumped so I ignored it.

00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:30.260
 And then I saw it like getting bumped a few times and I was like, oh wait, this is something

00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:37.500
 different and I opened it up and it was just like a bunch of clips of very strange rhythmic

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.580
 variations and I was like, oh, hello.

00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:41.580
 Yeah.

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.460
 It's kind of what it's about, right?

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:47.940
 It's about like being able to modify different rhythmic variations very quickly.

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:48.940
 Absolutely.

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:49.940
 Yeah.

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:50.940
 Well, that's what it's temporal modulation.

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:51.940
 Yeah.

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:52.940
 Yeah.

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:59.300
 It can do and I hate to generalize like that but it's good for strange rhythmic stuff and

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:05.940
 like almost tribal-ish drum rhythms, you know, and things of that nature.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:11.260
 And I noticed even in his examples he used what sounds like Japanese drum samples, which

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:16.460
 is cool, you know, but you can do a lot more with that it seems.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:22.260
 Like he has a lot of weird humanized functions built in there and curves to the percussion

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:26.060
 stuff so you can do things that are like speeding up and slowing down.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.060
 Oh, nice.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:31.980
 It's almost like if you were to have a Zadar and instead of it outputting an envelope to

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:35.860
 that wave, it's outputting gates to that wave.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:36.860
 You know what I mean?

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.780
 For lack of a better way to describe it.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.620
 Like it's definitely wave-based.

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:45.300
 And it wasn't just gates because each of the four channels have three auxiliary outputs.

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:47.020
 Those were only gates also?

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.180
 Well, let me back up a second.

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.020
 Well, there's four channels.

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.020
 Yeah.

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.020
 Okay.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:58.380
 Each channel has four outputs, your main gate output and then the three auxiliaries.

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:05.620
 He has adjusted it now in the beta firmware so that one channel of each of those tracks,

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.300
 each of those auxiliary tracks can be CV.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.300
 Right.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.300
 Right.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.980
 That's it as well or sequence.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:19.020
 So you could essentially have like one main gate, two auxes, one CV per channel or per

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.020
 track, I should say.

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.020
 Yeah.

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.020
 It's a little confusing.

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:26.740
 But yeah, it's a beast of a fucking rhythm and sequencer.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:29.340
 It's kind of like the type of thing I've always dreamed about.

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:37.500
 It does what I've tried to rig up like my vector and my marbles and my two grids to be

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:42.220
 able to handle in conjunction with the Befaco bursts and the logic module.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:43.220
 Yeah.

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:49.380
 I mean, I have a whole fucking case over there dedicated to doing what this one module can

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.660
 do and this module seems like it can do it a lot better.

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:53.660
 Yeah.

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.580
 It's kind of very impressive.

01:01:55.580 --> 01:02:00.220
 Like it got the bursts in there and the speed variations and he's inputting logic.

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:04.900
 So it's all on board.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.340
 Kind of like how gate storm can do.

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.340
 Right.

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.260
 I don't want to pretend like gate storm doesn't exist.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.260
 That's out there and it kind of does some of this stuff too.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:16.740
 It just seems to take it to the next level.

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.700
 It's not a small module.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.620
 But for what it does, I would consider it small.

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.620
 Yeah.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.220
 Like I said, like I have a full rack of shit.

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.500
 Yeah, what you're replacing that is a fraction of the size.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.500
 Yeah.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.500
 I don't.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.500
 It's still a ways off.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.780
 Like it's not scheduled to come out until like August.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:36.860
 Oh, damn.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:44.780
 He's been basically putting out almost weekly updates since the Kickstarter started and

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:48.100
 he's been very transparent with this whole process and everything.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:53.420
 And it's evolved a lot since like it was first announced.

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:58.060
 Like he just started asking for suggestions on Muff, you know, and like Muff's the type

01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:01.980
 of place where if you ask for thoughts, you're going to fucking get them.

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:07.580
 So like everyone had their own two cents on what flux should be.

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:10.940
 And it kind of got overwhelming for me to even read because like everyone had different

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:14.820
 ideas and different directions and different thoughts and myself included.

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:19.380
 You know, I gave him some feedback on some things which he implemented.

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.220
 I was like, cool.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:26.020
 And he would like take everyone's suggestions over like a course of a couple of days, reply

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:31.300
 to them, talk about what he is going to add based on those suggestions and what he's going

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.300
 to rethink.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.060
 And you know, he was very transparent about the whole thing.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:42.260
 He even redid the whole like initial panel of it so that there would be more modulation

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.260
 inputs.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:49.300
 But essentially he opened it up to being more modulation possibilities, more destinations.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:54.940
 Like there's a modulation grid in the menu and now each track is going to have capability

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.900
 to have things pointing to other things.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:02.380
 So you could essentially change your curve or your speed or anything like that.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:06.900
 So you can come up with weird ways to arrange things and now with the possibility of the

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.460
 CV outs, you can self patch it.

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:13.660
 You know, I mean, you can have other channels modulating your other channels, you know,

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:16.980
 so it's going to be really interesting.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:23.060
 Aside from like NerdSeek tracker module, like, I feel like this is probably going to

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.780
 be like the most IDM-ish.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:31.180
 Yeah, you know, focused sequencer out there.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:34.300
 What is some poor modulation synthesis, Dave?

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.620
 Do you know?

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:43.020
 It is modulating the concept of time and time as a, as a, as a, as a curvature of the

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:49.660
 time is creating rhythms by modulating the, the linearity of trigger distribution within

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.620
 a step.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:56.580
 Each step can output a density of between one to 64 triggers.

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.580
 He did a really good job.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.900
 There's a couple of not just weep through that, not just videos, but there's these sort

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:05.860
 of like little tiny, like one minute clips of like temporal modulation in action.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:06.860
 It was pretty cool.

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:10.780
 They're like, I don't know if it's a hundred percent clear after seeing them, but it gave

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:14.140
 me a better idea of like what it was.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.140
 Yeah, absolutely.

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:17.700
 Those are the things they added to the very gate.

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:22.020
 It was the ability to like do bouncing ball between steps so you can modulate like kind

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.780
 of the time that it would take for those things to hit.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:25.780
 Yeah.

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.780
 Yeah.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.140
 So was this the first thing he's done?

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.500
 Yes, as far as I'm aware.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.500
 Okay.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.820
 We'll just kind of came out of nowhere.

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:33.220
 In orbit labs.

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.220
 All right.

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:36.260
 So we've discussed this in the past.

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:41.380
 I'm pretty hesitant to just dive into a kickstarter, especially from someone who hasn't released

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.100
 anything.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:49.180
 But this dude's like level of transparency and just like pure excitement for what he was

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.180
 building.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.180
 I was like, fuck it.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.180
 I'm in, you know, son of a bitch.

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:58.100
 I'm in kickstarter sequencers using the word flux.

01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.460
 You'd be aware.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.780
 Not a good story.

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:04.140
 But yeah, I hopped on.

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:08.180
 Like I said, I think it was number five to back at that morning and that was like within

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:13.300
 the first hour or two that I went live because I had a little reminder, but I was asleep

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.580
 when it actually kicked off.

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.500
 So you're not that serious?

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.100
 The person who I wanted to be number one.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.100
 I really did.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.100
 Because that person serious.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.100
 Yeah.

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.100
 Because this thing was mind blowing to me.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:24.060
 I was like, this is essentially my dream sequencer.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:27.740
 Like in the Olympics, if you came in fifth, there's not even a battle for that.

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:29.940
 That's like, what's up, poser?

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:30.940
 Yeah.

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:36.140
 Maybe the other first people will fall through and then I'll default to number one.

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.140
 In my heart.

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:38.140
 Thank you.

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:43.300
 But yeah, no, it looks amazing.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:47.140
 And just like break from the start, you know, he laid out everything.

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:50.220
 He even came up with like a chart, you know, describing the whole piece of how he's going

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.660
 to build this, the time frames.

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.220
 He was very open to suggestions.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.940
 And so just gave me the Mormon fuzzies.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:00.220
 I felt confident in backing it.

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:05.820
 So he was talking about, and there's, I think there's one video there now of the temple

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:09.420
 spaces can be so short that you can use it as an oscillator.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.420
 Yeah.

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.020
 He had like drones.

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:16.140
 So then he was like using it as an oscillator and then applying modulation to it and getting

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:22.180
 interesting sounds out of it, which is definitely an atypical use of a gate sequencer.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:23.180
 Yeah.

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:25.180
 It's almost like a wave table since the 10th.

01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:26.180
 Yeah.

01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:27.180
 And it's pretty strange.

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:32.140
 And if you have a sampler or percussion voice that can handle that speed of triggers

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:37.180
 and you can have that thing going in a very strange way, typically wouldn't be doing otherwise.

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.020
 So the potential is kind of through the roof for this thing.

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.020
 It is.

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:47.140
 It's, I mean, at the base level, yeah, you can just have it doing some pretty standard

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.500
 interesting rhythmic shit.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.380
 It sounds like something, even if you were going to trigger it from another sequencer,

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:56.020
 it would be useful just to be able to get between steps like the way it can, you know?

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.020
 Exactly.

01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:00.180
 And that's like something I've been trying very hard to do over the last year.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:05.180
 It's like find the in between steps that make sense and sound good.

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:10.380
 And it's very hard to do on a 909 style sequencer, even with micro stepping.

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:11.380
 You know what I mean?

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:15.660
 Like you're not going to be able to achieve the type of like curves and I can kind of

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.660
 achieve that with the Bifaco bursts.

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:24.100
 They have CV ins for like the ability to start at the normal speed and then speed up.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.780
 So you're increasing the multiplication of the burst or dividing it.

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:29.980
 So you can do bouncing ball type shit.

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:34.260
 And one of the problems I've had with the Bifaco is despite still being on that grid is that

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.980
 there's always a little bit of latency.

01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:41.540
 Once you introduce something like a burst generator into your trigger path, you know what I mean?

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:45.740
 It always kind of, and then it makes the rest of the rhythm kind of off and I don't, it's

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.940
 fucking frustrating to me.

01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:50.180
 This is all in one, all on board.

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:55.180
 Everything will be in time in sync the way I want it to be in a musical fashion.

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:56.940
 Pretty fucking excited about it.

01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:59.980
 And there's a micro SD card for saving a bunch of shit.

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:03.860
 Yeah, you can save all your sequences that you come up with.

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:06.420
 I don't think it was a huge amount of stuff that you can save to it.

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:09.900
 You said that's a stretch goal.

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.620
 And I think he made it.

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:16.300
 Some of the other stretch goals were like phase shifting, additional IO, interface tweaks.

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.700
 All that's been done.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:22.380
 And then yeah, the four analog envelope outputs, which we also reached.

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:26.220
 I think we hit all of the stretch goals on this thing.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:31.780
 Well, someone who wasn't involved in the original project or campaign, can they order

01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:33.820
 it now after it's closed and finished?

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:37.700
 I don't think they can yet.

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.740
 They're going to have to wait, I think, unless it's on the website, I'm not sure.

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:43.860
 I'm still going by the Kickstarter page itself.

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:50.980
 It was 350 pounds and I think the non Kickstarter ones, like the non-early birds, I think they're

01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:53.740
 going to be more like 450 pounds or something like that.

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:54.740
 Not substantial.

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:55.740
 Yeah.

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.060
 That means what you get from sleeping.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:02.060
 You snooze, you fucking lose, man.

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:03.060
 Right.

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.060
 Yeah, I don't know.

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.060
 It's just very interesting.

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:09.260
 He added some more like burst generator type of stuff to it as well so you could like

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:15.420
 hit it with a gate and then have it go do its like one shot, you know, temporal cycle

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.420
 of gates.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:17.420
 Yeah.

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:18.420
 So, pretty versatile.

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:19.620
 I'm excited about it.

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:25.060
 I think I'm going to be able to replace quite a bit that's in my percussion sequencing

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:27.380
 rack and logic rack with this.

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.940
 Couple grids.

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:29.940
 Couple.

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:30.940
 Yeah.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:34.020
 Couple grids, a couple burst generators.

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:37.780
 Couple marbles, couple branches, couple plugs.

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:40.860
 Oh, you got to keep one plug though.

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:41.860
 Yeah.

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:43.780
 You might not need to, honestly.

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:47.780
 If this thing does all what it says does with the logic stuff, I might not need it.

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.500
 Let me know how my bat went off you.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.060
 But yeah, Flux.

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:53.060
 Yeah.

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:54.140
 I don't even know what this dude's name is.

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.140
 I forget.

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:56.380
 Let me look him up.

01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:58.380
 What is he on a muff?

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:04.820
 So the guy's name on Muff's is VC oscillator and the muff thread has been kept up to date

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:10.860
 by him as the kickstarter progressed as has the thread overall.

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:14.800
 He's been pretty good at communicating with everyone that has been commenting or asking

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.780
 questions or given suggestions.

01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:17.780
 That's cool.

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:18.780
 Yeah.

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:21.700
 It's something I wish more people would do.

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:22.700
 Yeah.

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:27.300
 I feel like the success of this and the transparency of it and how clear cut everything was from

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:32.020
 the start, people should take some fucking notes moving forward.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:33.020
 Yeah.

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.020
 Yeah.

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:38.980
 It would definitely inspire me to back more kickstarters.

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:43.260
 I mean, even do you think you backed it was a little surprising because we've talked on

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:44.420
 day one of the last two.

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.420
 Yeah.

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.580
 Usually I wait towards the end just to see how things are shaping up.

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:48.820
 You know what I mean?

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.420
 But yeah, I jumped right in.

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.580
 Well, not right in.

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:52.580
 Head.

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:55.180
 Well, you know, for other people actually did that.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.180
 God damn it.

01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:57.180
 Yeah.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.180
 I mean, those people are on sleep.

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.180
 They actually care.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.180
 Son of a bitch.

01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.180
 Son of a bitch.

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:04.100
 (electronic music)

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.020
 (electronic music)

01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:09.020
 (electronic music)

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.940
 (electronic music)

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.860
 (electronic music)

01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:17.780
 (electronic music)

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:20.780
 (electronic music)

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.700
 (electronic music)

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.940
 (drumbeats)
