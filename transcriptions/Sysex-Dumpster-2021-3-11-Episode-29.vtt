WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.960
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.360
 So, uh, Dre, what are you drinking?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.600
 It seemed like you were a huge fan.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.600
 Yeah.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.920
 So it's lemon ginger seltzer from Trader Joe's.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.760
 I love ginger, so I wanted to give this a shot.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.920
 But it tastes like a fucking flavor of cough medicine

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.240
 or a cough drop, like a halls.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.720
 You know what I mean?

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.520
 Like that lemon-y ginger flavor, that's kind of really gross.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.160
 But without the healing, meant the lip-ness.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.680
 Yeah.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.400
 It's meant the lip-ness really heal anything.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.680
 It used to help me a lot.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.120
 But you got to get natural menthol.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.400
 Like from a Newport.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.080
 We're cool 100s.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.560
 Distilling a cool 100.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:24.560
 She's got to soak it in some alcohol overnight

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.640
 and then just wring it out.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.040
 Drink that juice.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.840
 Yeah.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.320
 Get you some cigarette juice.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.160
 Dave's face.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.920
 I'm also having trouble with the idea of bothering

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.120
 to put it into the cigarette only to extract it later

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.880
 and ruin the cigarette in the process.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.560
 Not the most efficient transport mechanism.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.560
 Jesus Christ.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.680
 So how about you, Dave?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.800
 What's the better--

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.560
 I'm throwing a curveball here.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.040
 I'm drinking wine.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.320
 Whoa.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.600
 Hell yeah.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.200
 How fucking sophisticated.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.720
 No.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.920
 No, it's going on like that.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.720
 It's actually Mad Dog 2020.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.120
 It is adjacent to the Mad Dog 2020.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 But yeah, it's like the $10 bottle at the one in Spirit Store.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.400
 Some boom farms.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.600
 Yeah.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 Man of Chevy's.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.400
 It is a Merlot, or at least it claims to be Merlot.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.200
 Yeah.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.320
 I was drinking a lot of cider and was like,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.520
 let me try to mix this up.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.240
 Let me see if I can find a wine.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.680
 Because I just didn't like it for a long time.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.120
 And I was like, well, there's a million varieties.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.000
 Let me just give it a shot.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.400
 We're a shelter in place.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.200
 A muzzle.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.680
 Give it a shot.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.680
 And I found it much that I like.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.280
 So what do you like?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.640
 Like Merlot so far, a Cabernet 7-year-old.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.080
 Yeah.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.840
 But like you like a dryer, like kind of fruitier thing,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.320
 not so sweet.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.320
 Yeah.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.760
 It's just like cider.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.480
 I like really dry, dry wine.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.240
 I don't know.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.000
 I need to start-- if I'm going to do this,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.240
 I need to start taking like note,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.320
 like keeping notes and shit.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.280
 Because now I'm just like drinking a bunch of different wine

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.560
 and then kind of forgetting which ones I like,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.520
 which is not good science.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.840
 It's as an experiment.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.600
 It's a terrible experiment.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.160
 A couple of friends of mine were telling me about the Pittsburgh

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.920
 wine mixer.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.000
 Yeah.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.760
 Because I was like, I don't want to be a wine person.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.480
 Sorry if any of our listeners are wine people

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.960
 and take this seriously and are sophisticated people.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.320
 I'm not.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.120
 And so I was mentioning, I'm like, it's a shame that I can't--

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.800
 there's not like a punk rock wine thing of like, here's wine.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.840
 We like it, but we're not snobby about it.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.280
 But I got the recommendation.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.160
 I have not tried it yet because we're still--

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.160
 it's February.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.960
 We're recording this in February.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.840
 And we're still in hell.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.360
 When that's done, it's one of the places I want to check out

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.880
 and to learn a little bit more about this.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.360
 Maybe even find some other stuff that I would like just as well.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.920
 The Aptake of Wine store is great for that too.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.840
 I've been definitely into the natural wines.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.880
 If I've been drinking anything, which I haven't been drinking

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.600
 much at all over quarantine, it's been some natural wine.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.360
 I had to beer the other day and it gave me a headache

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.240
 like immediately.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.840
 It's weird.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.800
 I just can't.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 I haven't been drinking it.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.000
 That's what wine does to me.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.360
 Oh yeah.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.120
 Like I love the taste of it, but any time I've tried to get

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.160
 into it, it immediately gives me a headache.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.880
 It's like instant hangover.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.440
 I mean, before I started this experiment,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.640
 I associated wine with getting a hangover.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.080
 And there's one quality of wine that--

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.360
 because I don't have the vocabulary,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.920
 I don't know how to describe it.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.160
 But as soon as I started drinking wine,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.840
 every once in a while, it'll taste like battery acid to me.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.320
 And that's not one of the tasting notes.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.680
 I can't say I want the wine that doesn't

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.760
 taste like battery acid.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.120
 That doesn't mean anything.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.480
 I don't know.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.080
 Becoming a little bit more informed

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.120
 might help me be able to describe what it is I like better.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.680
 I wanted to try some natural wines.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.280
 I was looking into it around Christmas time

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.160
 because Sam, my brother mentioned he was trying

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.920
 to get into wine now instead of less beer.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.840
 Because he decided it was too unhealthy for him.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.440
 He wanted to drink something a little better for him.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.000
 So I got him a bottle of natural wine.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.840
 It was like $50.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.280
 To me, it was expensive for a bottle wine.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.080
 Oh, that's all right.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.800
 So I was like, I hope this is good stuff.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.440
 And he said it was absolutely amazing.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.840
 And it knocked him on his ass.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.360
 He said it was strong.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.960
 And then he followed it up with some stuff

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.440
 that he got on his own, which ended up

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.320
 being Dave Matthews' brand.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.560
 And he said it was so trash.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.840
 And he didn't even get him drunk.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.400
 But he still woke up with an incredible hangover

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.800
 the next day that he doesn't understand.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.000
 So yeah, he's experienced both sides of the spectrum now.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.800
 $50 natural and $5 garbage.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.920
 This is the Dave Matthews of Dave Matthews brand.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.240
 Crash into me fame.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.800
 It was that same Dave Matthews.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.480
 This is him marketing to soccer moms and Karens.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.280
 And your brother.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.320
 And my brother, apparently, and me and my cousin

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.840
 keep giving them shit for it.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.400
 Why did he buy it?

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.120
 We don't know, dude.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.040
 That's what we asked.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.400
 We're like, why?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.760
 I was like, I bought you a super expensive bottle

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.040
 so that you could experience what good wine is.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.400
 It was one of the highest recommended in the store.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.000
 They only had one bottle left.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.760
 I don't expect you to go out and buy $50 wine every day.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.600
 But I wanted you to see what's out there.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.600
 You know what I mean?

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.120
 The taste, what could be.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.240
 And he went with the complete opposite end.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.440
 I was just like, you don't like Dave Matthews.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.600
 And I said, why the fuck would you buy his wine?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.240
 He's like, I don't know.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.000
 I figured he knew his shit.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.760
 Name recognition is a powerful thing.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.160
 I guess.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.520
 Yeah.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.920
 Yes.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.440
 Because it wasn't like you like Dave Matthews snuck his wine

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.720
 in like Sam drank it.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.280
 And at the bottom, there's like a little note that says, ha ha.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.200
 It's from Dave Matthews.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.040
 Like--

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.640
 And apparently he had never heard of the infamous Dave

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.320
 Matthews tour bus dumping 300 gallons of human waste

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.520
 on that tour boat in Chicago a few years back.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.720
 So that I had a--

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.200
 Educating in that store.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.120
 Oh, man.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.640
 Yeah.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.120
 So like Dave Matthews tour bus caravan

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.560
 decided to just empty out their fucking toilets

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.600
 while they were driving across a bridge in Chicago.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.280
 Just do some nice illegal dumping, you know,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.880
 right onto the bridge and into the river.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.520
 Because fuck everybody, right?

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.920
 Well, just so happens that there was a fucking tour boat

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.520
 going under the bridge at the time of this slathered

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.400
 this entire group of people in human waste that

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.320
 has been fermenting in Dave's tour buses for this entire tour.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.400
 300 gallons worth.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.320
 Yeah.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.920
 Terrible, terrible.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.200
 300 gallons worth of concert shits too.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.040
 Those aren't just regular shits.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.440
 Those are tour shits.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.720
 Coke-fueled McDonald's filled dukies.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.720
 Yeah.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.520
 Nasty, nasty stuff.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.040
 I really hope your brother was drinking the wine

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.240
 as he heard the story.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.640
 Oh, that's exactly it.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.040
 Yeah, I mean--

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.560
 OK, good.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.520
 Me and my cousin were joking.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.200
 We were like, does he add a little extra flavor to his wine?

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.640
 It's a little bit of Dave in each one.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.720
 He's like, what are you talking about?

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.800
 And I was like, yeah, just a little bit of that human waste.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.800
 He's like, what the fuck are you talking about?

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.120
 So I had to educate him.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.120
 But yeah.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.720
 Fuck Dave Matthews.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.000
 Fuck Dave Matthews.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.400
 Again, we've talked about the idea

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.120
 of alienating our listeners.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.800
 If you are someone who is a Dave Matthews fan

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.040
 and you feel alienated, you can fuck right off.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.400
 Yeah, I think we're all fine with that.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.400
 If--

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.000
 Sorry, but not sorry too.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.320
 It's an equal to you drinking.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.600
 Health aid kombucha.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.280
 Ooh, back on the kombucha kick.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.840
 Back on the kombucha.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.880
 I was just at the co-op getting some groceries,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.520
 picked up some kombucha.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.200
 Yeah.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.760
 Stomach was feeling a little garbage.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.320
 I've been trying to be slightly healthier and not just--

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.280
 Still never tried it.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.120
 It scares me.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.320
 Some of it's really bad.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.760
 And some of it's really good, though.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.160
 There aren't too many brands I like.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.560
 But this health aid one, it's not bad at all.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.840
 It's definitely not like--

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.800
 Some of it can be some natural wine

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.760
 where it's drinking someone's bile, basically.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.280
 Right.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.960
 There's two vinegary and stuff.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.680
 Yeah, it just tastes like vomit.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.160
 But if I'm in the right stuff, it's good.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.760
 This is the bubbly rose flavor.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.280
 Ooh.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.760
 Which I did not know that was a variety you could get.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.640
 Yeah, they all kind of taste the same,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.920
 but it's got a little like a chariot, a little rose in it.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.920
 Kind of nice.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.080
 Well, hopefully it works on your stomach.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.280
 I hope so.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.600
 Well, here we are with our beverages.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:53.760
 Right.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.240
 Gathered, socially distanced, gathered.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.760
 As always.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.760
 So 29.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.360
 Mm-hmm.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.080
 It's been, what, two months since our last gathering?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.640
 Yeah, we're great with timely recording.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.600
 Yeah.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.880
 It feels like nothing has happened in these last two months.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.880
 You know what I mean?

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.960
 Wow.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.600
 Trump stepped down calmly and peacefully.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600
 Yeah, finally.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.080
 There was no drama.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.520
 Nothing bad happened there.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.120
 He accepted the election results and moved on, you know?

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.240
 Graciously.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.880
 A plus country would vote again.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.040
 Joe Biden single-handedly defeated COVID.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.800
 Handemics over.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.320
 But not in our hearts.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.560
 Economy was great.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.760
 Yeah, the stock market.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.080
 Rock solid.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.080
 Nothing weird happening there.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.680
 Bitcoin been blowing up, though.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.160
 Oh, dude.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.360
 To the moon.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.280
 To the moon.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.760
 I love the songs.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.120
 But then down by 10% in a day, too.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.000
 So it's all a roller coaster ride.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.840
 My game stops back up today, feeling that squeeze.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.240
 Oh!

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.240
 I'm excited.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.560
 This is the weirdest world.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.560
 Yeah.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.920
 We all thought 2020 was the weirdest timeline.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.160
 2021 has been off to a great start in two months so far.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.360
 Trying to one-up 2020.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.240
 Yeah, it's just a continuation.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.520
 Like, the idea that it was somehow going to stop this because we've arbitrarily decided

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.520
 that the new year now.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.160
 We got some huge news, though, in the modular world this week.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.960
 Huge news.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.880
 The module everyone has been waiting for for years.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.640
 For the piece of gear, I should say.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.360
 I don't want to just limit it to being a wand.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.320
 I'm talking, of course, the make noise straggle.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.080
 Oh, you're coming out of the gate.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.360
 Jesus.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.000
 Swing it.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.840
 Swing it.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.600
 Swing it a turd hammer wildly.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.680
 I'm a Dave Matthews.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.480
 Give him a minute.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.840
 2021.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.160
 What are you going to do?

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.160
 Yeah.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.440
 2021, the year we can all pretend we're Alessandro Cortini.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.440
 Finally.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.440
 Yeah.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.440
 That's all I've ever wanted.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.440
 How much warble?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.240
 So much warble and unstable filters.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.240
 Ooh.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.520
 Like it's at the bottom of the ocean, perhaps.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.520
 Yeah.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.160
 Well, I think it doesn't come with like, Dremamine or something to overcome the motion sickness

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.360
 that's going to induce.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.360
 Ooh.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:32.000
 That's the magic right there.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 It's unstable filter on stable filter.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.280
 It's actually a clone of the surge, Dremamine.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.280
 Nobody knows that.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.120
 Beat him to the punch.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.440
 It's based off of an old secret booklet panel.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.080
 It was dosed in Dremamine.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.360
 Oh my god.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:58.480
 But what it's like, it's a dual oscillator through three delays, right?

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.480
 That's like kind of it.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.480
 Yeah.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.480
 It's got like three sections.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.320
 So like apparently you're going to external in, then there's like this like generic sort

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.640
 of sound generator section.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.640
 And then there's the time and filter experiment at the end, which is where you control how

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.960
 much warble.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:21.160
 All of that then gets influenced by the agitation function generator, which is the this this.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160
 It's all nonsense.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.600
 It basically modulates everything.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.760
 And that's what gives you the sort of warble effect over everything.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.360
 That's a it's a random LFO.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.040
 Oh, 100% on everything.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040
 Just call it everything.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.040
 Everything.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.840
 It's it's literally like it sounds like the smooth CV generator from the waggle bug.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.360
 Probably.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.600
 And there's also like touch pads.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.160
 That's the magic.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.760
 You got to put your essence into your music, Dave, if you want to sound like Cortini.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.760
 Yeah.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.680
 If you're not touching metal, what the fuck are you doing?

00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:00.760
 You're not putting your fingers on them touch plates coated in snot and urine and old skin

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.800
 flakes and saliva like that is where the magic comes from Dave.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.200
 I had intended to put something else on those touch pads.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.920
 Put those fingers on those slicks.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.200
 He's not talking fingers.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:21.040
 That's what Cortini doesn't tell you.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.760
 See, he'll give you the little secret.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.840
 He'll give you the straggle, but he doesn't let all the secrets out now.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.840
 Right.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.960
 You got to drop your nuts on them plates, boys.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.400
 For one night, Dave was in nine inch nails.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.400
 Nobody knows that.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.840
 I mean, I assume somewhere at some point we're going to talk about beads.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.560
 And there was that thing of like there was a lot of shitty beads videos and I was like,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.080
 well, there's going to be a good one eventually.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.520
 I had faith in this.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.160
 Watching those straggle videos and I was like, oh, this is this is what this does.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.640
 This is this is the highlight reel.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.640
 How much is it to?

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.640
 Like 600?

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.440
 I was going to come out the gate with that.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.920
 It's the price that kicks me in the ass the most.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.320
 This was like a core $99 toy.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.400
 It would still be like, this probably isn't worth it.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.040
 This is a full-throated, full-featured $600 piece of gear.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.040
 And this is what it does.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.040
 That's absurd.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.720
 I mean, granted, it's a contained self-synthe voice.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.720
 That's cool.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.240
 But yeah, for $600 rather.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.280
 I feel like half that price tag is going to Cortini just because he put his name on it.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.120
 Like there's no reason for it to cost that much.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.080
 Yeah, I agree.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.920
 And you got further than I did, Dave, with figuring out the sections.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.280
 Like I've tried multiple times.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.080
 I feel like every time I start reading into it, it's just paragraphs after paragraph of

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:48.480
 like marketing hype and confusing labels and shit, like mysterious alchemical experiment.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.480
 And stuff.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.800
 Like, what are you talking about?

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.680
 They're being deliberately obtuse.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.680
 Extremely, extremely.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.160
 But I think it's like an experiment, probably.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.360
 They're probably like, huh, what can we do in making these like one-off art PC kind of

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.400
 things that any like doesn't even matter if you know what it does in a way, you know?

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.800
 People were buying it before they even knew what it was.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.280
 But it's like, I'm not that type of person.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.080
 I need to have a basic understanding of what the fuck it is.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.800
 Well, I wonder if it's not appealing to you.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.240
 I wonder if it is appealing to someone who's like, doesn't want to know.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.520
 Clearly, I'm not the target audience here.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.760
 But I was curious about it.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.920
 I wanted to like it.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.880
 Like, I didn't stick my nose up to it like the minute it was released.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.880
 You know what I mean?

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:37.000
 I tuned in ahead of time to watch the release, the big reveal with Cortini and Sonic State.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.640
 I just, I don't know, like they went on and on and never really got to the point of what

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.640
 it was.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.960
 They were doing a lot of like, deba, they were doing a lot of like, making sounds and

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.240
 then sort of gushing over and sound and then, which was really weird because Sonic State,

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.800
 I was a little bit surprised because normally he is like, I want to know the details.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.400
 I want to give you the, I want to kill this thing apart and know everything about it.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.880
 That's why I watch Sonic State.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.880
 Yeah.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.880
 Yeah.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.520
 And to watch them just him to sit there and kind of go like, this is magical and wonderful

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.280
 was like kind of a disservice.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.080
 Like, I wanted you to ask the hard getting questions there when you're not.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.080
 Right.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.840
 And then at the end of it, I was like, well, okay, obviously that was just a marketing

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.840
 hype clip.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840
 Fine.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.680
 You know, it was a big reveal trying to get people hyped up.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.600
 Surely there will be more information to follow soon that makes more sense.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.600
 There's none.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:30.000
 Like if you go on the perfect circuit page for it right now, like it's literally like

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.280
 eight paragraphs of weird vague buzzwords and marketing hype.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:41.360
 And then finally you get to the section that says, so what is Strega?

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.360
 And then it continues on with more buzzwords.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.960
 Like I even quoted some of them.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.840
 Special Cortini style flavor, his distortion, tape like Warrable, murky echoes, huge evolving

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.240
 drones and subtle instability.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.400
 Okay.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.440
 That tells me nothing about the gear itself.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:02.760
 Like these are sound design terms, sure.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.760
 Huge evolving drone.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.760
 Okay.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.760
 What is it though?

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.720
 How do you generate a huge evolving drone with this thing?

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.880
 Like, that's the thing.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.960
 I don't think this even makes any sense without Cortini.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.320
 Like it's Cortini first and then the Strega product.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.960
 Because if you just released this, like, yeah, you couldn't even explain it to people.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.600
 Because they'd be like, okay, why'd you do that?

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.160
 What the fuck is the point of this, I think, you know, and or how to give it more too.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.680
 Because you look at the panel and all of the functions and all of the parameters are weird

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.680
 obtuse names.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.680
 They're not helping you.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.800
 We're like, like, we're going to make this a usable instrument by giving you reasonable parameters

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.040
 and its cryptic names and symbols.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:45.120
 And it's almost like it's really just leaning into the like, don't worry about it.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.800
 We just want you to like move these knobs around and eventually it's going to sound

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.240
 like a Cortini track.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.240
 Yeah.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.720
 Let me quote another piece of their marketing hype from the Perfect Circuit page.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.080
 It says, "Making equal use of science and magic to allow you to combine simple, common

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.080
 ingredients into something more than seems possible from its constituent parts.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.400
 As such, it would feel odd to attempt to break it down and label it with traditional synthesis

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.600
 terms like oscillator, delay, wave shaper, etc.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.680
 Why?

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:21.520
 Why would that be odd to label an instrument with proper labels that actually signify what

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.600
 it is so that people who make music can recognize it?

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.280
 That's what every synthesizer is.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.400
 It's a combination of certain components that make it an instrument.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.400
 You know what I mean?

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.480
 This isn't doing anything different in that regard.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.920
 Now you pop this thing open.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.480
 There's a little super high Cortini Smurf in there.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.320
 It doesn't even use like resistors?

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.360
 No, there's like a little Cortini Smurf in there getting blazed on DMT with your fucking

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.360
 audio signal.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.200
 Yeah, I mean, that's what makes, you know, a voice a voice and a synthesis.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.320
 It's like all the components assembled together to form a cohesive instrument.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.880
 If they want to be vague, that's fine.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.080
 Like if you want to do your standard weird make noise labels, okay, but at the very

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.720
 least like the overview or the page for the product should at least break it down, you

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.240
 know, into something that makes some sense.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:17.120
 I mean, it fucking Vlad of Somalabs can do it with a Pulsar 23, something that complex

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.400
 and like otherworldly.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.600
 There's no reason in the world why Tony can't break down what the fuck a straga is into

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.680
 a single paragraph of like, it's this.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.800
 Do you think he's worried about ruining the mystique though?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.240
 Do you think that's the problem is like, if I just explained what this is, it's not going

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.880
 to seem mystical and wonderful and strange.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.880
 I don't know.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.120
 Like who actually buys into that though?

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.040
 Like, I think it's people that are not us.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.320
 I think there are people that are like, this is, this defies explanation.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:48.200
 This is like, I think like if you are someone who wants to believe that this is something

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.360
 that is outside of a normal synthesizer, not telling you how it works is one of the

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.320
 ways to keep that mystique going.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.520
 This might not get beef for us at all.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.600
 This might be for Cortini fans that are like, oh shit, I'm such a big Cortini fan that this

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.480
 is like an expensive record box set that I'm buying.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.480
 It's just make sounds.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.640
 That's kind of what I was getting as well because like, yeah, most of the product page

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.480
 before you even got to the so what is straga section, there was like a mini biography of

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.480
 Cortini there.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:23.120
 And so it's like, okay, you know, how much of Cortini is even in it?

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.160
 Like aside from like advising them to use touch plates and things like that, like this

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.160
 is clearly like another make noise instrument.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.800
 It just has like his name on it's not like he engineered the thing.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.520
 This is definitely, you know, something that was created by Tony.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:39.440
 I mean, that's one of the many things that's not spelled out is what was he involved with

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.560
 how was like, because they had like one, the one videos like Tony and Cortini, like side

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.880
 by side, but like that was clearly just set up for the video.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.440
 Like it's not like they actually have footage of them whiteboarding this design, you know,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.280
 like so it really, there's no way to know.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.520
 It's just weird to me, man.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.640
 Like when I buy an instrument, like sure, hype it up makes like electrons notorious for

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.640
 that.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.040
 You know, they always had some weird vague marketing videos and it was like, okay, cool, but it

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.640
 was always immediately followed up by a technical demo and a layout of like what the fuck this

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.440
 thing is and what it does, you know what I mean?

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.800
 And it's like, okay, so you got your hype there and then you got your actual information.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.760
 Like that's, that makes sense to me.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.920
 Like, I don't think I've ever bought a piece of gear thinking that it was fucking magical,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.920
 you know what I mean?

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.200
 Or that it would ever make me sound like insert artist name here, you know what I mean?

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.880
 Like Cortini, you know, he has a fucking full blown studio of thousands upon thousands

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.160
 of dollars worth of gear and vintage sense.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.920
 Like you're never going to replicate that in a fucking $500 box that fits in the palm

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.920
 of your hands.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.920
 Like, sorry.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.440
 But there's also a fact that it costs $600.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.120
 And if this really does have just a couple of simple things behind the hood, people don't

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:59.560
 want to necessarily know that, oh, I'm paying $600 or $200 worth of parts that I could

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.080
 put together with these other modules.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:10.200
 So this may also just be a way to like not have people question the $600 price tag by

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.480
 not revealing just how little is actually behind it.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.720
 That's the thing that got me to is like, you know, they're like trying to make it sound

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:23.480
 like this is doing something completely, you know, all chemical and magical and like,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.480
 so it's like, it's doing nothing that you can't do with any of the other make noise

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.480
 modules.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.960
 You get a maths, you get a waggle bug, you get a filter in there, whatever one you want,

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.960
 you know what I mean?

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.440
 From their lineup, a synth voice, you know, or an oscillator, I should say, you can get

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.440
 there.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.960
 It's probably just like a shared system patch to these like this is my patch.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.520
 Let's make it into a box.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:51.000
 The first I thought I was generally like intrigued by it, you know, I was like, oh, that could

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.680
 be a really cool live performance thing.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.680
 You know what I mean?

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.640
 To like do some drones and things like that, I wouldn't have to break out my full rig.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.840
 I wouldn't have to worry about my patch, you know, be self-contained.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:08.280
 But to be honest, like all the weird purposely vague and obscure descriptions and labels

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.560
 and stuff kind of like completely turned me off to wanting to look into it more.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.120
 And it seems like a little one note.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.840
 I mean, it seems like you're always just landing back on that warble drone sound, which is

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840
 cool.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.840
 I'm okay with that.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.840
 Yeah.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.320
 Like if that's what you want, I'm not paying $600 for something that really produces what

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.840
 appears to be a limited set of sounds.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.840
 That's too much.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.840
 Yeah.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.360
 If it can do those sounds quickly and easily cool, but yeah, I wanted to see what else

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.800
 I can do beyond that.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.720
 And I haven't seen too much beyond that.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.560
 Like light bath actually put out a demo the other day and I was like, okay, he's probably

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:48.440
 going to do something that's not so courtenious and do some interesting, you know, ambient

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.440
 drones and stuff like that.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:55.360
 But even still like that wasn't his demos didn't really show it doing anything different.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:03.480
 So yeah, my joke about Strega being the big news clearly wasn't the big news.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:11.920
 Beautiful instruments, beads, the most anticipated module of the last, what, three, four years?

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.920
 Something like that.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.920
 Yeah.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.360
 When it was first announced, I think it was 2017 when Emily announced that she was starting

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.440
 it.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.960
 So yeah, like four years pretty much.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.200
 That's kind of cool.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:33.720
 I honestly wasn't that like impatient about it or like hyped because I still really like

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.600
 my monsoons and you know, my normal clouds.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.280
 And I was like, yeah, you know, clouds too.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.000
 It'll probably have some new bells and whistles, but you know, I can wait.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.440
 I'm not going to be that blown away by it, but Emily proved me wrong.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.640
 She proved why she's she is who she is.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:03.680
 Yeah, I likewise, I've got a pre-order in and I was I had a pre-order in when it was

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.480
 like right before the Div Kid video where it was just a lot of, you know, really kind

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.880
 of sorry if any of our listeners made these boring videos, but like there's a lot of just

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.680
 really boring sort of clouds.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:20.760
 The expected clouds, atmospheric drone, granular swells and stuff.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.720
 And it was and they sounded fine, but I'm like, yeah, I've got monsoon.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.720
 I'm doing fine.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.720
 I don't need this.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.720
 Yeah.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.200
 And then it bentor into it.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.520
 And at the end of that video, I was angry that I didn't have one.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.520
 It is.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.120
 I've not knocked it out of the park yet.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.120
 Yeah, totally.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.120
 Absolutely.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.600
 It sold me to like, I'm trying not to spend money right now.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.320
 I'm in the middle of a move and everything.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:50.040
 And I was doing good at just keeping beads out of my mind until I watched the Div Kid

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.600
 video, like all 45 minutes of it.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.200
 And I was just like, fuck, I gotta get one of these.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.800
 I gotta put in some overtime or do another on call rotation or something to be able to

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.760
 get one of these as soon as possible.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:10.880
 But I didn't realize just how much of like, this is the like the K-TEL comp of mutable

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:17.120
 instruments, like with the no input, you get plats, wave tables and the 10-u randomizers

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.280
 use marbles algorithms in them.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.200
 So like, there's just like all this great amazing new stuff and like just this cherry

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.320
 pick of hits from the last couple of years jammed into it.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.040
 There was no part of that video where I was like, oh, that's that's something I'm not

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.040
 going to use.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.600
 I think it's almost the apex of mutable instruments.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.080
 It's like the fitting end is like, holy shit.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:47.000
 It really bums me out to know that this is their final module.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.280
 But it is an incredibly good high note to end on in my opinion.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:57.880
 Like since the release of braids, like mutable has like dominated my rigs, you know what

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.880
 I mean?

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.480
 I've always had more shit from them than any other manufacturer in my setup.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.720
 And it's going to be weird to know that there's nothing new coming down the line from them,

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.720
 you know?

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.720
 Kind of bums me out.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.880
 But I don't know.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.360
 You know, with everything being open source, maybe people can still springboard off of

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.120
 the existing stuff, you know?

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.960
 They always do.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.960
 Yeah.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.960
 Yeah.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.520
 Instead of just downsizing them and making them more compact, maybe people can actually

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.400
 start expanding upon them, you know?

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.400
 I think it's a good way to like good luck making that smaller or improving on that too.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.640
 It's almost like designed to be like, all right, you're not going to fuck with this, you

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.640
 know?

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640
 Like, what would you even I don't know.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.520
 It seems like perfect in a way.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.640
 They even have the attenuators on the CV inputs, which was like, you know, something that

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.600
 mutable arguably didn't necessarily have in the past.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.560
 And some of those, um, those redesigns had that was one key feature that wasn't a lot

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.560
 of them.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.640
 And now it's no, that's already on there.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.320
 And we, let's focus for a minute on those.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.280
 Because I think that's fucking brilliant.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.320
 The, uh, a 10 you randomizers.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.120
 That is fucking game changing.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.120
 When I read the description of it, I was like, no, and then I kept reading like it got better

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.120
 and better.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.200
 Like, at first I was like, yeah, okay, you know, you can attenuate this way, you know,

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:18.560
 if you turn clockwise, it's an attenuator for turn counterclockwise.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.360
 You're adding random CV voltages to that parameter.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.880
 I was like, that's cool, but I do my own random stuff.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.160
 I do my own generative patching.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.320
 I was like, I don't really need on board randomizing until I read how it functions when you hit it

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320
 with CV.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:40.240
 And, and the, so when you hit it and it's in like, you know, randomized mode, the positive

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.360
 voltages will increase the level of randomization within that.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:51.600
 So using like some logic modules or attenuators, switches, things like that, you can start

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:57.200
 to do what I've tried to do with clouds, but required a lot more modules to do.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:04.040
 You know, I mean, like you can get generative sequences of like things shifting and going

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.600
 back to normal, you know what I mean?

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.680
 Like, if you attenuate like a gate and you're hitting that shit, you know, at the right sequence

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.480
 and then you got things randomly changing to the rhythm and things like that.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.800
 Like, that's the type of shit I like to do with clouds.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.280
 And now it's all right there under the hood.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.680
 You know, like that takes a whole bunch of extra shit out of the equation.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.680
 Like, you know what I mean?

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.840
 Like I used to use a bunch of marbles to do that type of thing while going through like

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:33.280
 a couple switches and my logic modules and things like that.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.320
 You know what I mean?

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:44.120
 So it's like Emily not only thought of people like us who are taking clouds in that direction,

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.120
 but like she even fucking improved upon it.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:51.120
 You know what I mean?

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.960
 And it's also like if you don't want to use that, if you don't, if you want to just use

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.600
 it like clouds or you want to use it in a in a completely different way, all of that's

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.600
 still available to you.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.680
 You know, you could just use this as the most intense delay module you've ever bought.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.000
 I mean, that's a weird usage.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.320
 I don't know if I want to limit it, but like that is something you can do and you can do

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320
 it well.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.400
 The first thing that I always thought was awesome about clouds to begin with, like I was talking

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.760
 to Nick right before the beads, stuff came out.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.760
 I forget how we got on the conversation, but we were just talking about like how I don't

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:27.560
 have any effects aids in my rig still, but I use my multiple clouds in every patch in

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.040
 some way.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.760
 Even if I'm not doing clouds-ish stuff, I still I know the module like the back of my

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.720
 hands and I can utilize it, you know, in different ways to do like courses or delays,

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:43.000
 you know, little things like that, just mild pitch shifting here and there, you know, I

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.440
 mean, just little subtle things.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:51.480
 And yeah, like beads just seems like even more so you can do that type of like, you

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:58.640
 know, it's a Swiss army knife of a processor, not just doing like granular or beach shifty,

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.920
 you know, beat stutter things.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.600
 Like you can go in many directions with it if you want to familiarize yourself with

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.600
 it enough.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.280
 And I just think that's awesome.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.920
 You know, I like effects modules that can be like that.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.760
 I've never been too into one trick effects, you know what I mean?

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:20.160
 I like ones that I can get really fucking experimental with and clouds has always been

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.160
 my favorite.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.840
 And now I'm just like, I can't wait to dig into a beads, you know, alongside my clouds.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.240
 I was gonna say I love the simpler version of doing the quality too.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.640
 Like it's a lot better than the way it was on that is on current clouds.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.840
 I love that cassette mode.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.840
 That's it.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.840
 It's good.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.240
 The feedback seems a little better implemented too.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.520
 Like it's really easy to go off the rails with the feedback and, you know, standard clouds.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:51.640
 But the way they have that design, it looks a little, a little more interesting and same

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.640
 with the pitch.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.040
 Like if I read correctly, it actually has like an indentation when you're exactly one

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.560
 octave up, which is really nice.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.560
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.720
 Little things like that, like just little thoughtful things like that just make the design

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.840
 that much better, in my opinion.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:11.040
 Just streamlines all the things together that I like to do with clouds and like puts a lot

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.280
 of that functionality under the hood already.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.840
 And then if you don't have anything in the input after a couple of seconds, you get plates.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.840
 Yeah.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.840
 Like the buffer gets loaded with the same wave tables as plates.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.320
 Like, it's so smart.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.440
 Yeah, what does that mean when you don't have inputs?

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.240
 Well, I'm gonna give that a context.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.320
 I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you something useful.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.320
 Yeah.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.320
 Even if you plug nothing into the inputs.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:41.120
 It takes it from being just an effects processor into a self-contained generative ecosystem.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.120
 Yeah.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.600
 That's like the only way I can think to describe it.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.920
 Like I don't want to call it a synth voice because it's not technically, but it's like

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:55.080
 a fucking ecosystem of like capabilities, you know, like everything on there can feed

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.960
 and function with each other and you don't need anything else plugged into it if you

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.720
 don't want it can just, you know what I mean?

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:07.200
 You can go into a generative world, you know, where everything's like organically interacting

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.560
 with each other on its own.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.120
 Like that is some next level shit.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.320
 I was even kind of like, all right, I still, I still have to come up with something to

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.480
 shit on like, it's just not in my nature to be nice.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.640
 I was trying to as well.

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.280
 I couldn't think of a single thing.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.280
 I could.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.280
 Oh, really?

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.280
 Oh, what is it?

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.280
 The name.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.680
 I don't like the name.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:32.600
 But I don't know why like after the more I've looked into this module, okay, well first

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600
 let me say this.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:40.240
 So I don't know if you guys saw this, but Emily posted a very interesting history of

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.480
 this module like from its conception to release.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.880
 Oh, I didn't see it.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.880
 It was it's awesome.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.880
 It's on the forums.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.680
 Yeah, it's like the entire timeline, every change that they made everything that they

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:54.560
 approved, why things got set back over to like the last literally four years they've

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.760
 been working on this.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.760
 That's sick.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:02.480
 Yeah, it was cool to see all that information and in that information is also the original

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.320
 name, which was seeds.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.680
 And I was like, that's brilliant.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.680
 Like, you know what I mean?

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.880
 Yeah, there's even a parameter on there, you know, seed.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.880
 Yeah.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.480
 And I was like, and as soon as I saw the word seeds, it's like that is so much more like

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.080
 organic and like fitting to me.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.880
 And then Emily's notes literally was, yeah, I feel like seeds is a more organic name and

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.880
 fitting.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.600
 I'm like, yeah, yeah, why don't you go with that?

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:28.080
 But for reasons unknown, they went back to beads.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080
 And I just don't like that.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:34.240
 Like when I hear beads, the first thing that jumps in my mind because I'm a fucking pervert

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.400
 is like anal beads.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.400
 Right, right.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.400
 You know what I mean?

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.400
 Like it just pops in my head.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.320
 I'm like, but then like when I remove the perversion from my brain, I'm like, okay, yeah,

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.400
 don't go down that road.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.400
 You're not shoveling.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.640
 You're not shoving modules up your ass.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.160
 Just think of like what a normal bead is.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:53.400
 And it's still it's just, I think of like, you know, just a static object, you know, just

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:58.360
 a piece of material, whereas like seeds, you think of like something more organic living

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.440
 breathing and the whole module itself feels like an ecosystem.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.400
 So I'm like, I feel like they should have made something more in that direction with

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.400
 the name.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.600
 All right, Greg, I got a deal.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.160
 So when you eventually do get one, just let me give it to me for a night.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.480
 I will take a knife, I'll scratch out beads, scratch in seeds.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.480
 Awesome.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.480
 Free of charge.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.480
 Nice.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480
 It's a good deal.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.800
 I'll get a little label maker.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.800
 I do have a label maker and I could just do that for you as well.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.040
 And then it would look like a Pittsburgh module module.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:35.280
 Maybe when the inevitable clones get released, someone will call it seeds.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.000
 But yeah, I just feel like that was a better suiting name.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.880
 So I'm very minor and stupid complaint, but that was the only thing I could come up with

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.880
 that.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.800
 I have to complain about this thing so far.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.920
 Well, you win this round.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.200
 You found something to complain about.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.000
 I knew I could.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 I had faith in you.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 I knew you could do it too.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 Hell yeah.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.680
 Is there a ghost at your house, Dave, or is that the train?

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.880
 It is the train.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.680
 That sounds very spooky.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.040
 I love it too.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.680
 It sounds like screeching metal.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.960
 It's like a FFT quality to it a little bit, you know, like a little like the way that

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.160
 stream tears it apart.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.680
 Oh, that's a nice mug, dude.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.680
 It is.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:21.680
 It's a super nice mug, actually.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.800
 It's like kind of small.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.480
 It's like a drink tea out of this fucker all the time.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.280
 It's awesome for listeners.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.760
 Can't see Nick's awesome mug.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:35.360
 It is a Sherman filter bank mug Sherman compact to filter bank mug.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.480
 Want to go into it?

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.480
 Yeah.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.880
 And you're also wearing the shirt wearing the shirt.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.320
 I've got the stickers right here because somebody wanted to see the stickers.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.960
 Yeah, I've used three of them, I think.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.000
 Now to come with like a big oversized foam and you could also be like wearing.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.560
 That'd be so sick though.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.560
 Yeah.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.600
 I don't know if you've like seen the, you know, electronic beats.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:03.960
 They did the T-Mobile had that they did the streaming shit, but they do a Sherman interview

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.560
 and it's kind of fucking amazing.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:10.400
 He's like a mix of like, oh God, this is going to be terrible.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.600
 He's like a mix of like Rick from Rick and Morty and like Ryan, Xanopticon.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.000
 It's like.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Sorry.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.440
 Sorry, Ryan.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.880
 But yeah, he just, no, he's like clearly like fucking mad audio scientist guy.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.840
 He's just like listening to him talk about the Sherman is like intoxicating.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.160
 But yeah, I don't even remember what triggered it, but there was one day and I was like,

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.800
 Oh, I saw the compact to Sherman.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.000
 And I was like, fuck, I needed a processor.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.280
 Maybe I just gotten my dark matter back from it being fixed the second time and was more

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.280
 into distortion and like really wanted to try the compact to because I forgot that there's

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.880
 like Sherman filter bank, which was the big ass wedge that's been around since like the

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.840
 90s, which to be honest, I should have gotten in the fucking 90s.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.760
 That would have, that would have been a good choice.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.960
 They did the two, which was just updated circuitry, less noise, get people with bitch

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.960
 about that.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:09.120
 And then they did the compact to because it turned out like there's not much circuitry

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.280
 and they're like, Oh, people want something that's a little smaller.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.040
 And it's like this beautiful form factor.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.160
 So I was like, okay, I'm going to try this thing out.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:22.080
 And it's fucking magical in so many ways, to be honest, it is easily my favorite distortion

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.560
 processor because of all the different territories you can get into.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.400
 It's like designed really well, even I was laughing.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:33.440
 I was like, Oh, it's got like three MIDI thrills who fucking uses three MIDI thrills on this

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.440
 thing.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.400
 Like I fucking do actually because really?

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.880
 You end up realizing the MIDI stuff.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.680
 Yeah, it makes you want to sit drum machines around it and you need clocks into those drum

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.680
 machines.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.920
 So there are all these MIDI thrills there.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.480
 So it's like, okay, got me.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.440
 Like that makes total sense.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.480
 It's so much shit to it.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:55.000
 The only thing I'll start with a con because there aren't many is that I wish there would

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.440
 be CV control on most everything.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:04.400
 There's only like really one CV control input FM input, which can be audio rate or control

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.040
 rate, which is cool.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.080
 It's weird how it's like this inner linked thing.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.000
 Like there's so much that depends on the input distortion, which you get this thing and you

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.680
 think like, Oh, it's a distortion box.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:20.640
 Well, it distorts at the input, but everything else is like, am distortion or like the filters

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.800
 in the way that can kind of push into some weird territories with like the biasing of

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.960
 the filters, which makes the filters kind of confusing at first.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:33.040
 But long story short, like that input distortion depends like that's what changes how the envelopes

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.800
 work that you use to modulate everything.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.120
 Like those are interlinked, which is an interesting decision.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.160
 You'd think there'd be like a separate like threshold for how the envelope triggers on

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:45.480
 the input, but they just kind of bound in with the distortion.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.800
 But it gives it like it's Shermanness too, I think.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:54.160
 And like you end up using, I love those envelopes and the way the AD and the ADSR envelopes

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.680
 could be triggered by that input and the way you kind of use those as internal modulation

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:05.520
 sources for the filters, the way the AM can kind of play off of that ADSR too.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:10.000
 You could have like the, well, the LFO is also right there next to the ADSR and you could

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.640
 have that kind of work on the input triggers.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.080
 So you could have it free run.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.480
 There are different modes for it.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.480
 So there's like a lot of thought put into that because at first I was like, I generally

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.920
 hate AM in things unless it's a modular.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.360
 Like I don't use it as like an effect because I'm like, it's cool.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.640
 It's amplitude modulation.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.880
 But on this, it lets you push it into its own distortion territories that you can then

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.400
 shape with the filters and that's like just infinitely more interesting the way the signal

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.960
 path has it kind of rounded in the way you can blend it.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:44.600
 You can blend it the way you can sweep between parallel and serial distortion is fucking

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.600
 awesome.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.600
 Yes.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.520
 All those chains, those are those chains are available and you could have it half and

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:55.080
 half and that's just like nothing really does that that often unless you're patching

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.240
 that like a modular type environment.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.720
 So I'm just looking at it right now.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.200
 The filters like they can be a little confusing at first and you can you can get it to be

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.200
 silent.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.240
 You're like, I don't understand but it's really the way the biasing works and the way the

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.640
 biasing can let you make all these different filter shapes.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.840
 Even in the manual, there's like a kind of diagram which you've got to get a litter familiar

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.000
 with to know like how it can create these different slopes and shit.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.280
 But there's so much flavor in there.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.600
 I love all the noise.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.720
 I guess I'm glad that I have the one that has reduced noise because it's like the perfect

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.320
 level of like this fucking grit that you can put in.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.720
 They're all sorts of weird like just a little subtle switch for like high boost, high frequency

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:41.480
 booster and high frequency cut that can add like it's almost like a different processor.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.920
 Just with those two subtle that kind of changes that's different than me just changing an

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.640
 EQ on a mixer.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.760
 You can do like sensitivity, you can have it like on the trigger input and that can trigger

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:56.800
 like some limiting of the sensitivity or you can have a limiter on the sensitivity of the

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.720
 trigger input and how it responds to the input signal.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.000
 The trigger input that relates to the envelope that is.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.160
 And then there's like an octave up switch.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.960
 So there are two filters which should be gone into.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.560
 The first filter is just kind of like a regular filter.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:18.800
 The second filter is either always harmonically related to that first filter or there's a

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.840
 free mode that's one of the filter positions where it can be whatever you set the frequency

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.840
 to.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.040
 But otherwise it's always going to be like a certain harmonic interval of that first filter

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.320
 and the way you can like gang that up with resonance and distortion like there's so much

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.120
 play in what you can end up building with it.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:41.640
 I'm still like kind of a noob with it I feel like sonically.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:46.520
 Do they share the same mode or are they both necessarily going to both be low pass or band

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.520
 pass?

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.520
 They're identical.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.160
 They're completely identical outside of that latching behavior that the second one

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.840
 has on the first one.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840
 Okay.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.840
 Same layout.

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.520
 So they're like immediately very familiar.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.360
 It's interesting.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:04.200
 You can, I think I mentioned this when I was talking about the crossover filter before

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.400
 how you can, or maybe the twin peaks so you can get to like areas where it's completely

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.480
 silent.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480
 You can do that.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.160
 You'd be like oh you've just filtered everything out.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.440
 You high-passed or low-passed everything into silence.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.440
 So you got to learn that.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.880
 So that's the only like, as I said, the real thing.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.400
 But yeah.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.400
 It's fucking awesome.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.400
 Oh yeah.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.440
 Two of the fucking LEDs are super bright and obnoxious and it fucking sucks.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.440
 It's insane.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.240
 They're like you love bright LEDs.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.560
 Well, so I'm going to offer you the same service I offered Greg earlier.

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.560
 I've got a knife.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:42.360
 I'm just going to come over to stab at that LED until it's so bright or doesn't work

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.360
 at all.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.560
 I've already got LED covers over them, but it's there are like five different types of

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.560
 LEDs.

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.360
 Like it's some mad scientist shit.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:54.600
 They're different sizes too, like two of them are super big and the rest of them are really

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.880
 small and it's just like, okay, that's cool.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.240
 I don't know because I think they've all always been like that.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.320
 It's like a very particular design.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.680
 The way the knobs are color-coded is very particular and it does.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.000
 It starts to like make sense.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.560
 Like the filter shits blue are that.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.000
 It's fucking sick.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 Yeah.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.760
 I feel like the term that we were using previously for beads being in its own ecosystem can also

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.960
 apply it to the Sherman for sure.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.000
 It's like it's more than just an effects processor.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.080
 It's more than just a filter.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.400
 It's more than just a distortion.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:33.280
 Everything within the system exists and feeds off of each other.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.280
 You know what I mean?

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.800
 To the point where like it feels alive.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.040
 Like that's definitely the thing that I like the most about the Sherman is that how

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.440
 everything interacted with each other and it feels like you're fucking with this organic

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:48.040
 instrument more so than just an effects processor.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.520
 It's all sweet spots too for the most part.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.520
 Yeah.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.440
 It's hard to get it to kind of be that shitty.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.440
 It's generally just fucking sick.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:02.480
 So I know you've been running like drums through it because you sent us videos that each sounded

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.440
 fucking astounding.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:09.560
 What else have you used it with thus far?

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.560
 Everything almost.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.000
 Modular 303 808 909.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 It's all I had to see in a way too.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.760
 It's just like listening to the classic records because you can tell people have been doing

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.760
 this for a while.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:29.120
 Like there are sweet spots with the toms and the way it over drives and the 808 is already

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:33.920
 melty with the way it's internal like summing of the sounds is.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:37.320
 Then you get the Sherman to kind of melt it up a little more and it's like that's the

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.320
 shit.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:44.760
 I loved my own personal love with it was running like FM and digital shit through it.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.760
 Yeah.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:50.800
 Combining the nice you know the ali's digital sound going through that overdrive preamp

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.240
 and that filter is just like a magical combination in my opinion.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.560
 It's alchemical.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.560
 It is.

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.480
 It's alchemy Nick.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.120
 Like turning light into gold.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.400
 Faster than light and harder.

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.600
 Are you tempted to give a second one?

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:11.600
 Do you think that would be like a worthwhile purchase to like have them run for one another?

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:18.640
 I would say like I had the analog heat for a while and I sold that kind of donated that

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.600
 rather.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.240
 But like that was better for a full mix whereas I feel like full mixes of audio really aren't

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.800
 good through the Sherman at all.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:32.680
 It's mono for the first part but like if you get too many instruments going on it just

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.840
 turns into a mess.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.360
 But it's great for individual sounds.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.520
 Like I understand the quad Sherman now totally.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:44.240
 I used to think that was like so fucking ridiculous and stupid but it makes total sense.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.480
 It's just makes as much sense as having four channels on a mix like or I don't know it's

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.920
 just four good processors for individual sounds.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.840
 Yeah I could see having a double for sure.

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.640
 That was one of my biggest complaints when I had mine was the fact that I wanted to run

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:03.000
 everything separately through it you know and I just did not have enough shurments and

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 I was like.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 Yeah.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.120
 Once you get to that point that you're running a quad Sherman it's like maybe you should

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.520
 be looking into a gear that you can run a whole mix through at that point you know what

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.280
 I mean it's kind of like.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.400
 Which is what I did that's how I ended up with the overstayer.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.360
 Like I sold my Sherman and went with the overstayer and now after two years of having

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:25.000
 the overstayer now I feel like I understand it a lot better and I do love running whole

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.320
 mixes through it but at the same time there's a gap now where the Sherman still hasn't

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.880
 been fulfilled that I would like to process individual parts with.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.880
 No.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.880
 Well trade straight up.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.880
 I'm game.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.880
 No.

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.880
 I'm just saying.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.760
 But I feel like the two would work well together you know I feel like I feel like my

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.920
 overstayer module channel wasn't a replacement for a Sherman you know if anything it would

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:52.800
 be a nice accompaniment to it.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.760
 It's the top of my gas list right now is the overstayer for sure.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.080
 This has made me really want one.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:05.040
 It's not happening but yeah I really want one.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:12.560
 I think any of the overstayer stuff would be good you know at this point like just knowing

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:17.240
 the module channel now and seeing like its strengths in comparing it to other overstayer

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:22.160
 gear I could definitely say like I wouldn't be opposed to having more overstayer gear

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.280
 in my rack you know I mean like there's times where I can just fuck around with the

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.040
 compressor for hours and hours I'm like maybe I should just own one of their compressors

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:33.600
 you know me for what I need to do just that and it's like like I'm like one of their

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:40.400
 MOS systems or whatever like the 500 series shit looks sick as fuck and that like NTO

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.720
 2A saturator or whatever that thing.

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:50.120
 So I feel like if you want to dive into overstayer you don't necessarily need to go the channel

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.560
 route you know like I did but I'm learning now that like I probably would have been super

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.840
 happy with any of their gear you know then some of it is like half the price of the channel.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.400
 I want the channel though.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.400
 Yeah.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.400
 Yeah.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.400
 Suradah.

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.360
 It's so good.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.200
 It's like it's the best one.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.560
 It's like it's fucking amazing.

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:16.160
 I've been having a blast with it still dude like it's endless fun for me playing with that

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.160
 fucking thing.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.560
 That being said like the Sherman really scratches the itch for me it's like oh I guess all

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:26.760
 like my tears will have to pour under the Sherman for a while.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.080
 It's okay.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:33.200
 Yeah it's fucking it's amazing though I can't imagine getting rid of it.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:37.200
 It's just like it's in the center it's literally between the modular and the rhythm now which

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.920
 is like the fucking holy space you know it's like it's just there.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:42.920
 Awesome.

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.280
 Here's another segue so don't fucking shit all over it.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:54.520
 Have you hooked up this and the Hyperion in any sort of signal path?

00:50:54.520 --> 00:51:01.280
 Yeah I have actually but I actually the Hyperion is right to the right of it but right now

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:08.320
 there's a dedicated channel for the Sherman into that buggy EQ into the mixer so that's

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:15.600
 like a separate mono path but I have run that into the Hyperion which will take line or

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:20.000
 Euro level very easily which is fucking sick about it.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 Can it?

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 I didn't know that.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:28.920
 Yeah no it can handle yeah line level Euro level it feels like one of the best synth tech

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.720
 designs I've ever used.

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:35.360
 I'm going to say for our listeners sake who might not know what the Hyperion is we're

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:42.080
 talking about the synthesis technology Hyperion what is the full name spectral processor?

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.000
 Is that what it is or?

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.200
 Hyperion effects processor.

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.200
 Effects processor okay.

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200
 Yeah.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.480
 Some reason I was thinking spectral is in the name but I guess not.

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.200
 What's the model of that?

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.200
 520.

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.200
 520.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.240
 It was originally a Kickstarter.

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.240
 Yep.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.600
 Yeah we saw a prototype of it at knob con and I'm in a snag one.

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:08.800
 It's still really hard to get but a few people got like three of them.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:14.880
 I think control mod got like three of each type and I managed to snag one one night one

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:18.400
 of the black ones and it's fucking incredible.

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.920
 It's my favorite effects processor.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:25.200
 I feel like it's very similar editing start of the 352.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:29.120
 It's the same menu system basically which I don't like on the 352.

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.600
 I don't like it on an oscillator.

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:34.040
 I think it's almost perfect for an effects processor though.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.040
 So what's its quality like what is it like?

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.160
 It's the same like so there's like a soft knob driven screen basically.

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.000
 You've got like four parameters.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.520
 You've got like four CV inputs on those parameters.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:53.360
 You've got a mix control left and right and a mix or feedback control left and right that

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.760
 are individual which is interesting because I was like for a second like looking for the

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.720
 delay parameter on like the algorithm and then I realized like oh no it's just you can

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:05.520
 use the feedback parameter just like use on delay but on any effect and it'll delay

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:09.120
 the signal which is super useful.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.120
 And then there's the mix left and right.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:13.880
 I mentioned that because it's one of the cons before I forget it in my mind is that

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:18.760
 you can't control the feedback and the mix values with the knobs for left and right at

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.760
 the same time.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:24.880
 You've got to do them individually unless you use CV that's molted across it.

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:30.480
 You can't like just turn the wet dry on the entire stereo signal perfectly evenly like

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.000
 you could on anything else.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.200
 But it gives you that control I guess to change it you have knobs for each but just a slight

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.200
 thing.

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:42.200
 I feel like it would make sense to have a feature to pair them.

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.200
 Tie them.

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.200
 Yeah.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.200
 Yeah.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.200
 That's I think already been in the software at some point.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.200
 Okay cool.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.200
 Yeah.

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.600
 And then the next row below that is the four CV inputs on all those controls.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.200
 So you've got CV on the mix and on the feedback too which is great.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.440
 And you get it individually so that could be a plus right.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:02.960
 You're not restricted to just having a B stereo because you can run things actually okay.

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:08.160
 You can run dual mono stuff on here like you can run two effects in a two of the mono

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.760
 slots like having two mono processors basically.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:14.960
 So now that I think about it that gives you full flexibility to use those.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.360
 So you can run one effect into the other.

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.360
 Yeah.

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:22.880
 There are a few like little there's an effect that lets you do that actually.

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.880
 Okay cool.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:29.040
 Um going I'm going to get back to the UI in a second but there are 32 algorithms which

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.440
 is something I also like.

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:36.760
 It's not like um the Evan Tide H9 has like fucking hundreds of things it can do.

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:40.720
 I like that this is just 32 basically even the effect.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.520
 I've decided I'm never updating my effects aids.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:48.800
 I'm just going to use the original firmware forever basically because it's too much.

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.000
 I like that Paul limited this and that they chose this many.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.880
 But for the interface it's awesome because you get these four controls and I think that

00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:01.640
 plays well to this type of like virtual things on a screen and like maybe just a light menu

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.640
 behind it.

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.880
 The 352 is very menu diving.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.680
 They made this so this is not menu diving at all.

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.080
 There are two extra parameter menus and that's it.

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.760
 It's the same two for every one.

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:18.120
 The 352 is like a fucking operating system almost the way like I know there's lots of

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.960
 like levels you can go to.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.560
 So I think for this it's perfect.

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.320
 It's like everything's up front I can see all the parameters on a screen.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:30.160
 Nothing's hidden like the H9 and I just get some abstraction.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.120
 Know exactly what I'm editing.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.600
 The screen's nice and it's great.

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.920
 I find I use it for bread and butter shit as much as this is sold as some like not bread

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:44.560
 and butter and like just spectral and FFT stuff.

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.120
 I love using the delay because it's just so easy to edit the parameters and it's all

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.120
 right fucking there.

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.760
 I can see V control everything.

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.320
 It's like what you'd want in an effects process for a modular.

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.040
 It's ideal.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.360
 It sounds fucking incredible.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:04.800
 It sounds like he wanted to like thumb his nose at the big guys for a bit.

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.600
 You know like I think he wanted to shit on Evan Tide a little.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.640
 You think you're fucking dope?

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.920
 Like here's like something that's fucking I don't know.

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.680
 It sounds just as good as any of that shit that I've heard or anything.

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.600
 I feel like a lot of the even tied stuff is known for like the black hole reverbs and

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:21.760
 shit like that.

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.720
 What would you say is like the strong point of the Hyperion like does it have a flagship

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.040
 algorithm or you just like all of them.

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.920
 That's a good like I'm still finding now because there's stuff on there that I don't

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.640
 like that much like.

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.640
 Yeah, spectral delay.

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.400
 I couldn't get to the same territories as the N.I.1 and so it was kind of like frustrating

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.760
 to me and I didn't I wasn't getting much.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.080
 I've gotten some stuff out of it but more just like oh that's kind of like a subtle ring

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:52.160
 modding thing that I don't know how to control yet.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:57.480
 The pattern delay like you get like tap patterns kind of similar to the Rainmaker and each

00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:03.640
 channel and you get CV control over the density of those patterns and you can kind of like

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:08.760
 do some shit that's really crazy in the stereo field by like CV controlling the tap patterns

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:12.400
 individually in each like ear.

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.600
 That I really I find myself using that all the time even the clean delay.

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:20.400
 I just really like because it's like an easy delay to use.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:25.560
 I think the kind of weird shimmer reverb is okay but like kind of similar complaints that

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:28.480
 we've had about shimmer in the past where it's like I don't know.

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:33.760
 There are only so many uses I can have for a shimmer algorithm really.

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:40.160
 The format voter like vocoder kind of form anti filter has been really fucking cool.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.480
 Yeah, I was really interested in that one.

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.480
 That one is really sick.

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.800
 I still have some beats through some format.

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:52.240
 Yeah, running beats through the format filter has been kind of gold.

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:56.920
 I have more hopes for the vocoder because I was kind of hoping to do something like

00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:03.080
 kind of like Fumana-ish or like some you know spectral processing of like synth sounds

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:07.760
 and like almost like the bark filter from verbose and getting kind of some of those sounds

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:12.800
 but I'm not getting like I don't know I don't have it tuned right yet with the carrier and

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.920
 the modulator for the vocoder should to understand it well enough.

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.080
 So it sounds like you've got a lot left to explore with it.

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.080
 Oh yeah, yeah.

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.080
 There's a lot going on.

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.720
 Yeah, no it's you can spend a lot of time just on each algorithm.

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:30.520
 It feels like just one of the algorithms feels like a legit instrument that would be like

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:35.720
 okay, if this was only did this it would still be pretty I wouldn't pay this much money maybe

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:40.640
 but it sounds great and there's so much depth like I've just been using those like three

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:44.840
 or four delays a lot to be honest.

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:45.840
 What else is there?

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:53.080
 There's like a weird like spatially kind of looper thing but what it does confuses me

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:57.520
 and like makes me think like just of how I would do it in the 301 like scanning through

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.480
 like kind of a sample loop.

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.240
 There's a looper stuff in there that I haven't really fucked with that much yet because I

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:08.320
 don't generally use a loopers and pedals but it seems like a nice setup the way it's

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.320
 done.

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:14.760
 There's a sync input from most of the effects so you can like tempo sync really easily all

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:19.680
 the effects that have that feedback on everything is definitely nice and being able to see

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:21.160
 you that that's pretty dope.

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:25.280
 But you know the overall sound quality I'm still learning what algorithms I don't even

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:29.440
 know like if I have like so much as like a filter yet or a favorite.

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.440
 Sorry.

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:37.680
 Now see been making updates to it I as I don't have one and it's kind of not something I'm

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:41.640
 going to get anytime soon because of how hard they are to find.

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:45.920
 I've been paying attention like is this something that he's continuing to update?

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:51.840
 The effects were updated last November 15th 2020 so this is not anything that's getting

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:56.920
 like effects aid level of like you know every couple weeks there's like a new algorithm.

00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:01.080
 I think they're trying to get these 32 down like they're listening to user requests still

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.080
 right now.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:08.080
 I think this is going to be like a slow rollout of anything of some of this stuff.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:13.440
 I'm looking through some of the algorithms here is just see if anything jogs my memory.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.960
 Oh shit.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.480
 The deflector shield.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.880
 It's just about to ask for that.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.520
 I was just going to say like would Paul actually put some of like his other algorithms from

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.320
 other modules in this thing.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.680
 The deflector shield is exactly in there and it's fucking amazing.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.680
 I love it.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.280
 I've been using that a lot actually.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.400
 I'm almost surprised because like there's only a couple hundred dollar difference between

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.400
 the two.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.800
 It almost doesn't make sense to buy a deflector shield if you spend like two or three hundred

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.680
 more and you get that plus all that like it's fun.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.440
 I was kind of thinking he wouldn't do it for that reason like you would want to encourage

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.400
 people to buy the individual modules.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.840
 That's that's pretty awesome that he's putting it in there then.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.840
 Yeah.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:55.840
 Yeah.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.840
 Granular pitch shifter that's sick.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.480
 There's definitely like granular stuff in there.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.480
 It's fun though.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.240
 Although that didn't sound as good as some of the other granular stuff like the phaser

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.880
 in there sounds sick as fuck like it sounds really nice and rich.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.240
 So I'm like I like flanging and phasing.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:17.400
 So it's nice to have like really good ones that are complimentary to the effects aid ones.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.280
 Multicorous like not as much you know.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.280
 Yeah.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.280
 Not as interesting.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.280
 Oh yeah.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.520
 They just have an algorithm called dual mono and that has like a low pass filter all these

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.920
 different filter types ring mod phase shifter phaser flanger diffuser.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.120
 Oh yeah.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.680
 The one diffuser is crazy diffusion flanger.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.680
 That's fucking wild.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.200
 I don't even know how you describe it.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:47.320
 It's like a smeary granular reaver of almost that's also a flanger like working with it

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.840
 and it just gets you to like these kind of FFT type territories that were interesting

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.040
 but like I couldn't I don't even know how to imagine what it does.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:00.480
 It just run into shit when you use it you know like sounds awesome.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.360
 Oh dude it's no it's it's fucking great like I had high hopes for it and then I got it

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.680
 and was like fuck them down.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.680
 Yeah.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:16.160
 I was trying to chill on effects for now but I got beads and a Hyperion on my hit list

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.000
 for whenever I could start buying modules again like both of them were just like top

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
 of the list now.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.600
 Did you do like Rainmaker type shit in here because you can stack effects can you do like

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.760
 comb filter into like tap delay or tap delay into comb.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:37.120
 You can you can only stack effects within those simple ones otherwise you only get one.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.120
 Okay.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:43.840
 Yeah it's just one stereo that would be yeah that's one thing that you know the higher

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.760
 end Evan Tide stuff obviously has like being able to do multi effects this is just like

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.040
 one at a time outside of that dual mono shit.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.160
 That's what the Hyperion is like the perfect blend of something that has multiple uses

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.880
 and like you can just sit it on one and it's there's no confusion about what the fuck

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.400
 you're doing on it at any point.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:08.400
 There's no like oh I wish I could just get to this more easily you know the H9 is all

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:13.360
 that it's all like I'm going to go through this list of parameters one by one you know

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.160
 and even with a knob box on it it's still just like look up fucking look up table you

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.680
 know it just gets old.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.400
 Yeah that's again why I decided I've got this FX aid print out like right above my modular

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.320
 and I'm just going to roll with the original 32 it's not broken I don't give a fuck about

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.320
 the filters.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.120
 Like I'm just going to use it.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:36.680
 Yeah I mean I keep saying that I'm going to try some of the new ones but I haven't and

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:41.560
 I'm still very stoked on what they do like was I have it printed on the bottom of my

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:48.560
 7u case taped like I don't know I want to try just because I think it's I don't know

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:52.920
 I don't know why I'm like I just I think maybe there's a little bit of like what we can do

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.080
 it I should try it that's how you get the most out of it like no it isn't.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.040
 There's this thing that trips me up about it because I was actually going to update

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:04.200
 it the other night but I think you've got to use the FX aid app right to get the firm.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:11.000
 Yeah yeah but you check which one you want and you can you basically configure a set

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
 on your own.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.720
 That's the thing I don't want to do that.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.280
 You can't even it doesn't even give you like here are the 32 defaults every time you go

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.280
 to get the firmware it's like well you got to build your pick your 32 and it's like well

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:26.440
 I don't that's not what I'm here for today I just want to update the fucking firmware.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:32.080
 You know but I don't know it's a minor thing but I'm just that lazy in that regard or at

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.400
 least just don't I don't want to deal with it.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:39.440
 I'm not disappointed enough of what I have to go see something else out.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:45.680
 So you were mentioning having you know H9 even if it was all surfaced with a bunch of

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.480
 knobs that could segue into 60 knobs.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.440
 Oh shit.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:05:00.840
 So Nick and I both made but made these and I'm sitting here extremely jealous.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:07.240
 So I was already like wildly I mean I've gushed about the LXR in a recent episode because

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:14.520
 I finally got off my ass and made mine and this just turned what I thought was already

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.960
 a 10 out of 10 into a 15 out of 10.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:22.000
 I'm so fucking jealous.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.560
 It's also like the LXR was great and it sounded good and I was getting a lot out of it.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:33.520
 This did that and now it's in that I rarely use this word because I'm like I'm not really

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.920
 into this I'm just gonna let you know before I say it.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:45.000
 And so it was also kind of uncomfortable a little but I was having fun using this and

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.320
 it was like this weird sensation and I didn't really know how to deal with it at first and

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.840
 like I kind of thought like there was something wrong because I was like I'm not familiar

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.720
 with this sensation.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.240
 What's happening to me?

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.240
 What is this?

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.880
 Oh wait no wait this might just be what they call fun and I'm having it.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:10.320
 Yeah just I fuck holy shit and it was a fun build like it was straight forward and you

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:15.560
 just plug it in and it's fucking there and even the one decision that I thought was a

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:22.440
 little bit odd at first because the top row doesn't start with course it doesn't start

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:26.440
 like the top knob is in course and I was like oh because it's probably what you're just

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.960
 going to have on the LXR itself.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.960
 Yep.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:30.960
 Yeah.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:36.280
 That's what your four knobs like if you just have the default screen for the kick drum

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.400
 that like there's no reason to recreate those four correct in the 60s.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.880
 So basically you have 64 knobs.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.400
 Yeah true.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:49.520
 I was like fuck you everyone this is brilliant.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:56.040
 Yeah the build was super well documented like the way to yeah it's just all it was a lot

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:58.360
 of it was fun to build.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.760
 Yeah.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.320
 It works really well like it's actually like kind of love for as much as I don't like

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.880
 acrylic cases it's kind of sick you know.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.480
 I was also a little bit like oh and it doesn't match the cool metal case that I have for

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:15.200
 the LXR but no I got over it pretty quickly.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:22.200
 I mean if someone made a cool black metal case for 60 knobs I would buy it without even

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:28.760
 thinking but yeah no I have no complaints about this and there's not a lot of lights

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.240
 it's not it's it just fucking works.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:36.440
 Yeah and you can pick your height too you can pick the LXR height to the smaller height

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.040
 which is kind of a nice touch.

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:43.040
 And I went with the LXR so they match up and and I even screwed the editor just to see

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:50.720
 if it worked and yeah it was really straightforward to change but yeah no this is 60 knobs like

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.400
 you know 60,000 thumbs up for me.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.200
 Yeah fucking awesome.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:04.440
 I mean the other reason I wanted to bring this up to Greg was like if you do find an

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:10.720
 LXR and you don't find a built 60 knobs I mean something I could bang out.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:16.720
 Oh yeah my my sausage fingers could handle soldering this together.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:21.640
 I thought you came into it across a hurdle though with the capacitors or something.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:27.280
 Oh that was entirely my fault because they didn't label to the there was resistors and

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:33.720
 it was it was I looked the colors that the color code checked them on a meter and put

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:39.920
 them aside I'm like okay those are the 220 R's these are the 100 K's ready to go and sure

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:46.240
 enough started soldering started putting them in and I fucked it up.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:52.680
 I didn't I couldn't get mad and I'm unsighttered it with them in the right one and but thank

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.600
 you Greg for bringing up that shameful shameful.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:01.480
 Well I'm just saying like I know if you come across something that tripped you up then I'm

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:06.960
 probably gonna totally fuck it up because I'm just not that good at building things but

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.120
 I think you got this.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120
 I think you got it.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.120
 I'm jelly.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.600
 I miss my LXR and when I sold it 60 knobs hadn't been released yet.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.480
 It didn't look like it was gonna come out at any point you know just look look like vapor

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:22.320
 where at that point like it was just something that was rumored that maybe it would happen

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.680
 someday and the fact that it actually exists now and is obtainable like eating my heart

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:34.960
 out and I want an LXR back with 60 knobs at some point but mine sat in a box for four

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.920
 years before it actually got built really about that yeah I bought it that shit right

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.600
 when it came out basically and just never did it.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.560
 Wow you having fun with it too or oh yeah it's fucking cool.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:51.120
 It's like great like it's right next to it there's like it's part I can't imagine using

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.640
 it without it now.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.640
 I use the decimation way more now because it's more like oh what's this gonna do whereas

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.360
 that was a parameter I would never go to before.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.520
 That was one of my favorite parameters actually.

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:07.440
 It pissed me off that you have to dive so deep to hit it you know I mean like that's

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.440
 why I never left it.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.440
 That's why I never left it.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.440
 I'm just going to overdrive.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.440
 Guess what.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.440
 All the way at the end there.

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.440
 What?

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.440
 You don't do that anymore.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.440
 No I'm going to throw it there.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.440
 I'm going to throw it there.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.960
 All right there your fingertips.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:24.040
 That's the thing I use both the overdrives and the sample rate reduction a good bit but

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.040
 not the decimation.

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.320
 I want to know who did but now I like it.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.320
 Yeah.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:33.440
 Yeah if you have an LXR and you don't have one you got a guy one.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.760
 Yeah that's it really.

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.600
 Will it make you sound like Alessandro Cortini though?

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.400
 Mmm probably not.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.400
 It won't.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.400
 I don't know if I'm interested then thank you.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.000
 Still everything is labeled correctly and explains what it does.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
 Stupid.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
 Yeah.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.920
 It should really just be a peanut butter sandwich that you rub around and it says like kangaroo

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.520
 ville you know.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.680
 This is the platypus nom.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.320
 Make noise platypus sandwich.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:06.320
 You want to know what it does?

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:31.760
 Twist it and find out bitch.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.640
 Okay.

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.060
 (drum beats)

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:46.060
