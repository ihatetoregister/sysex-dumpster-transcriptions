00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.120
 [Music]

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.400
 What episode is this?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.040
 Episode 39.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.040
 I'm glad you're keeping track of this, Greg, because I never know what the number is.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.000
 I honestly don't know why I remembered.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.400
 But yeah, I know it's episode 39.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.400
 Alright.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.920
 If I'm wrong, oh well.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.920
 It doesn't matter.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920
 There's no consequence.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.920
 Now episode 39.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.920
 Exactly.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.920
 Yeah.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.160
 So be it that's right.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.240
 One of those episodes.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.320
 It's a number.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.320
 What is numbers anyway?

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.320
 Math is made up.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 It's not real.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.320
 That's right.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.320
 It's like birds.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.400
 Do you ever hear the origin of the birds aren't real thing?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.400
 No.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.400
 It's really dumb.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.520
 It's just someone came up with a sign and went to a protest and stuck it up and then

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.520
 it caught on.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.520
 It just came on me.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.520
 Yeah.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520
 Viral.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.000
 For some reason when I heard it was an NPR thing, I thought it was going to be more involved.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.600
 It was just, and they were interviewing the guy.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.160
 He's like, "Yeah, I'll just goof around."

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.520
 It doesn't take much.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.520
 No, no.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.760
 Actually the best memes are the ones that are unintentional.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.880
 They just kind of happen naturally.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.880
 Yeah.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.880
 Yeah.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.240
 Talking about memes.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 Memes.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.160
 A bunch of old guys sitting around talking about memes.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.520
 This is the episode where we just talk about memes and how great the sound design and sound

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.400
 track is for Andor.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 Holy shit.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.400
 Is it good?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.560
 I haven't seen it.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 It's fucking amazing.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 Yeah.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.440
 I mean the show itself is also, I put it out there.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.600
 I think it's the best thing since the original trilogy.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.840
 It's, as of this recording, it's not done yet.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.040
 So who knows if they're going to stick the landing?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.400
 Like they could still fuck it up between now and the end.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.600
 But so far, every moment's been captivating.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 The stories have been great.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.720
 And yeah, the sound astounding.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720
 Yeah.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.720
 It's live action?

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.720
 Not animated?

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 Live action?

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720
 Yeah.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.320
 I think we're up to, well today episode 11 releases tonight at some point, but yeah, we're

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.440
 up to episode 10.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.680
 Sound design pretty excellent.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.080
 And soundtrack to a lot of classical sci-fi vibes.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.080
 Yeah.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.080
 Oh cool.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.080
 Yeah.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080
 But not cliche.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.040
 It has that vibe, but without just being a vangelous ripoff or forbidden planet, it

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.040
 has its own very distinctive take on it.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.400
 It's always weird to see something Star Wars related without John Williams blasting horns

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400
 in your face.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400
 Absolutely.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.760
 But it works.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.040
 And this has been kind of under the radar.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.520
 Maybe people are starting to talk about it now.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.120
 But when it started, I just was like, oh shit, Disney Plus is telling me something's on.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.280
 I'm guilty of that too.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.760
 I ignored it up until I think the sixth episode.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.520
 And then finally I was like, yeah, let's see what this is all about.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.840
 And then I binged the first six and I was immediately hooked.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.400
 Which is weird because that's all Mandalorian was all you heard about for a while.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400
 Right.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.320
 That was because of Baby Yoda.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.800
 I think nobody would have, well, not nearly as many people would have given a shit if

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.800
 it wasn't for Baby Yoda memes.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800
 Yeah.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.800
 But like Obi-Wan was basically unwontable.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.680
 And there was a lot of hype around that.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.880
 I remember even being kind of excited for it.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.440
 It was trash.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.520
 It was really bad.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.120
 I mean, even just like the idea of like, I'm going to sit around and just watch Sexy, Sexy,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.920
 You and McGregor, which should be enough.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.200
 That's been enough in the past.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.360
 I was, it was so boring that even him in that weird Obi-Wan voice, affected voicing that

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.720
 he does was not enough to carry it.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.720
 Yeah.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.160
 But Obi-Wan, a better show.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.560
 Oh, I see what you did.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.120
 I'll see you guys tomorrow.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.880
 Yeah, I'm sorry, everyone.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.440
 And that wraps up episode 39.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.840
 Nick has the high ground.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.280
 So who wants to kick it off?

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.280
 Elephant in the room.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.320
 What is all that fucking shit over there?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.320
 All right.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.720
 So last time, I didn't get the memo that we were doing show and tell.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.960
 And so do you ever have like a nightmare of the last day of a class and it's the final

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.920
 and you haven't gone to any classes and you're the only one who hasn't prepared?

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.080
 That was my last episode.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.080
 And you're naked.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.080
 I'm naked.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.480
 And I walk into Craig's house last time, naked, and you both have things for show and tell.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.800
 And I've got like mediocre pumpkin beer.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.040
 I'm just like, what?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.040
 This is a nightmare.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.040
 This is a nightmare come true.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.920
 And so I vowed I'm not going to let that happen again.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.760
 And maybe I went a little overboard.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.280
 This is a lot of stuff.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280
 I don't agree.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280
 I think so.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280
 Yeah.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.400
 I'm making up for some for a lost opportunity there.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.080
 So what we got here is a black hole case with a lot of chaos devices.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.080
 Specifically the Leibniz.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.080
 Leibniz.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.360
 I think that's right.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360
 Binary subsystem.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.480
 I was sort of alluded to it in the past episodes that I've been getting fired up for it.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.000
 But I'm basically all in on the system.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.600
 I think it's amazing.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.080
 So much so that over here I've built my own module to tie into that subsystem.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.080
 So buckle in.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.920
 Basically, my idea was I was going to give you kind of an overview of the system itself.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.960
 I don't think a lot of people are using it.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.800
 I think it's a little bit of a under the radar.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.280
 Like, you know, the niche of the niche of the niche.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280
 Yeah.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.080
 Sort of section.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.520
 So I was going to start with that and then explain what I've added to it.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.040
 So first off, Dresno.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.760
 Arguably the main driver for the subsystem.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:14.120
 It starts with an ADC converting signal or if you've got nothing plugged in or no initial

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.280
 state, just an offset on the Dresno.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.200
 Turns that into eight gates.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.760
 Those gates represent most truly significant bits in a 8-bit binary system.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.520
 You know, 0 to 256 unsigned.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.600
 And there's a little readout here that shows you.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.840
 You're going from top to bottom, most significant, the 8-bit all the way down to the least significant

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.840
 the first bit.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.000
 It has an internal clock.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.400
 And with each of those clocks, you get an updated representation that gets spit out into

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.400
 each of these gates.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.760
 And it takes a clock in so you can even slow that down.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.240
 But without an external clock, it's a brisk 2 MHz.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.560
 So it's, you know, it's ultrasonic based on what you put into it.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.720
 Either through this input jack or in the back, there is a 10 pin ribbon cable that shares

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.680
 data around through the subsystem.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.280
 That gets sent to the ADC, which then generates these gates.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.120
 And you can override what's going in through the ribbon cable with this input jack here.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.600
 Then there is the, and the output is these gates.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.760
 There's also a DAC, digital analog converter.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.720
 And if you notice here, there's also a sort of mirror of inputs.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.440
 You can override any bit by sending voltage into these.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.600
 And they correspond to, you know, this is the most significant at the top, least significant

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.600
 at the bottom.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.520
 These are overrides for what the ADC itself would generate.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.320
 At this point, are there any questions?

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.280
 I've tried to read up on this, these modules.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.440
 It confused me then, but I'm confused now.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.440
 So that's what I'm trying to do.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.440
 I'm hoping to alleviate.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.480
 No, I think it's one of those things that I would just have to see you play with in real

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.520
 time or an audio demo.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.600
 It's interesting because the audio effect of this is, at least from my perspective, the

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.760
 least interesting part of the system.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.680
 Is it basically just does analog to digital and then digital to...

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.880
 What does it mean as an effect, just demonstrating what it does?

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.280
 Well, I will show you right now.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.960
 So, okay, wait a minute, I'm going to explain.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.080
 To the listener, right now I've got a clock coming in from the Evaton clocks.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.800
 It works best with a square wave and that module is just square wave.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.960
 So it works great for this.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.880
 And right now it's just taking in, you can see it's sort of wiggling around a little

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:54.680
 bit there because it's just input signal from the Mosca sequencers, which isn't very

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.240
 interesting.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.520
 But what I'm going to do is getting that signal from where?

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.520
 Like behind the panel.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.840
 And see you actually plugged in.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.840
 It's behind the panel.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840
 And that's what's inside.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840
 It's inside behind the scenes.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840
 Yes, and that's...

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.520
 See this cable sticking out over here?

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.520
 I see that.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:16.160
 That's the 10 pin cable that all of the subsystems that participate in leemits from...

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.400
 See each, they all have an input and an output connector for this.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.400
 Okay.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:28.640
 So you chain them along and they basically send that data, that binary data to the next module.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.120
 And about half of them so far have this link button.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.280
 And what the link does, it says I'm going to take the data that's coming in as it's

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.320
 been processed.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.880
 This is, I'm going to do my own thing.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.680
 If you unlink it, you're going to do your own thing.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.040
 You have to pick how you want to chain them because it can have an effect on the downstream

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.040
 modules.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.880
 So wait, by linking you mean they're all sharing the same stream of data?

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.320
 It's linking with the incoming signal.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.320
 Oh, okay.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.080
 And then what comes next, it has an output and it passes along to the next module.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.320
 So it's literally serial?

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.320
 Yes, exactly.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.320
 Thank you.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.960
 That's a much more concise way of putting it.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.960
 It is literally serial.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.280
 Now it can be like a token ring network where it circles back in and on itself.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.160
 And a couple of modules only have an input or an output.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.680
 All the rest of them have inputs and outputs.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.000
 So you can have them in a circle.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.800
 And this is a slight diversion.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.760
 Someone out there, and I just saw this on YouTube a little while ago, created a patch

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.280
 bay of these 10 pin connectors, the surface of them all so that you can in like, oh, that's

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.280
 cool.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.040
 Yeah, like you can just do it on your modular.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.040
 Yeah.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.040
 Whoever that is, Bravo.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.200
 That's a brilliant idea.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:48.280
 So yeah, I'm going to, what I'm doing now is I'm patching from a Dixie an LFO into here.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.520
 And hopefully this illustrates a little bit better.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.440
 One of the things that I think is really interesting about this system.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.440
 Just a simple, this is a very simple example.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.280
 It's just a sine wave going into there with a reduced clock.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:08.120
 And as you can see, the ADC is taking that sine wave, turning it in.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.520
 These are just gates that are going to be coming out of here.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.480
 There's also this offset because it's designed to be unipolar.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:21.280
 But anything above halfway allows you to get the bipolar and process of bipolar signal

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.960
 and get the full range of it.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.880
 Otherwise you're only going to get the lower base.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.840
 And each of these lights here, there's a gate coming out corresponding for each of

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.840
 these.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.840
 Yeah.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.640
 So it's taking that LFO and deriving a gate based on its interpretation of that LFO.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.640
 Exactly.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.800
 I'll put it into those jacks.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.880
 And it can be any signal.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:47.680
 Like LFO, I just did this for this presentation, but you can send it from any signal coming

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.680
 in.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.480
 It's going to have this and then it gets turned into these series of gates.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.680
 I'm at patching in here.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.640
 I'm overriding one of the bits with another output from the clocks.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.640
 And what had previously been the most significant bit was not being hit, is now being supplemented

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.040
 by this external signal.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.400
 Is that external signaling an offset or is it just filling in the range that didn't exist

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.840
 in the other signal?

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:19.400
 It's overriding whatever the ADC, whatever turn that gate had been determined, it's saying

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.760
 ignore the ADC, this overrides that value.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.360
 And it's cool for stuff like this, because this is, again, this is principally how I've

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.320
 been using it or how I've been thinking about using it is as a gate sequencer coming up

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.600
 with a different way to use it.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.080
 And putting a bunch of these in, if you have an audio signal coming in, just really wrecks

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.520
 that bit crushing effect in a really interesting sort of tearing way.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.980
 Oh, yeah, I was going to say it because at first I was like, oh, that would almost be

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.440
 useless or there's some specific effect that it has on the audio, because it would be so

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.840
 fast that it would be like, you know, what gates are you?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.840
 Exactly.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.160
 This is the fine large, what the Dresno performs.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:08.000
 The one that I usually have following it is the Gina, the J-E-N-A, which I, and it takes

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.720
 and it also connects by this 10 pin ribbon cable.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.240
 And it is a wavetable lookup.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:23.200
 So it takes that value and transposes it into an offset and a lookup on a lookup table,

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.280
 gets that and then replaces with that waveform.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.280
 Oh, interesting.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.000
 So you're kind of scanning through this wavetable.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Exactly.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Yes.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.800
 Okay, that can, I didn't understand what that did until you said that.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.800
 Okay.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.720
 That one is really interesting with audio.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.120
 And then the other one I have is the IRFORT, which shigs all of this data and uses it as

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.040
 a binary bit accumulator.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.040
 Oh, okay.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.960
 Again, I'll take a break.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.200
 Is there any other questions?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.200
 Yeah.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.160
 I think I get it a little more now than I did before.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.360
 The documentation is good, but I had to read it like a dozen times.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.360
 And then play with it and then go back and read the documentation again.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.520
 It was a, it did take me a little while to grok.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.320
 And then, so I had a little bit of time on my hands.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.720
 I was like, oh, it would be really cool if there was this, an idea for something that

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.520
 would be cool to add to the system.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:21.240
 So, and I was like, well, obviously the data that's being sent around in this cable, why

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.880
 don't I just read what's coming out of that cable and reverse engineer it and make my

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.320
 own module, which I did.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.360
 So for our listeners, there is a 10 pin cable coming out of this black hole case into a

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.240
 weird ass little box with a breadboard and what looks like an Arduino and a shit ton

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.240
 of cables.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.040
 That is exactly what it is.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.040
 Yeah.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.000
 I guess we could post pictures on our Instagram.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Yeah.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Discord.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 It'd be a good day right there.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.920
 I also, I don't know how excited chaos devices is about me doing this.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.560
 This is not open source.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.320
 And I had to basically sit there within a oscilloscope and a meter and figure out what

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.520
 each pin does and experiment and the plan.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.520
 I hacked the plan.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.520
 I did.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:09.400
 And yeah, so I made an Arduino code here that's taking in the signal.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:17.040
 And as you can see, the first step was just making sure that I was replicating it, the

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.320
 data correctly.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:25.360
 And then I've added three outputs and it is the four most significant bits.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:33.320
 If more of them are on this sends out a gate, if more of them are off, it's low.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.240
 But because there's four, there's a chance for ties.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.320
 So I have a little toggle here for tiebreaker.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:46.240
 Either it's going to take whatever the state of the eighth most significant bit is or there's

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.880
 an input Jack here that I have, I'm going to read an external signal in and use that

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.880
 for that tiebreaker.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.160
 That's cool.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.120
 And so I've got that same logic for the least four significant bits.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.080
 And then this top Jack here is for all eight of the bits.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.760
 Is it getting power from that 10 pin cable to are you powering it another way?

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.760
 So it's powered.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.160
 The Arduino is powered by USB.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:13.560
 This is, there's a, again, I don't know how cool chaos is going to be about me sort of

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.320
 spilling this, but one of the pins is ground.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:22.560
 One of them is a clock signal, whatever, either the internal clock or whatever the external

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.040
 clock is that's coming over one of the wires.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.920
 And then the other eight wires represent one through eight bits.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.160
 It seemed like the design is, you know, when you get a clock signal, you read the state

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.080
 of all of those bits and then you replicate the state from there.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.080
 Makes sense.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.360
 So that's what the two megahertz clock is.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.400
 That's doing all the work in between those.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.720
 Well, during those cycles, right?

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.480
 If you have no external clock plugged in, if you plug in an external clock, it's still

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.480
 weird.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.480
 Yeah.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.480
 So like so weird.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.560
 So you're slowing down the computation with the external six.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.560
 Exactly.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.240
 You can see the external signal is still coming in, but the speed of the conversion is tied

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.920
 to the clock.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:09.480
 And so that's also why you're getting a somewhat irregular pattern is because the phase of the

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.600
 incoming sine wave is faster than the clock.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.680
 So you have the signal affecting in itself and the clock affecting the interpretation

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.680
 of the signal.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.680
 That's exactly pretty wild.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.680
 Yep.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.680
 Okay.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.480
 And it's also reflected over here in the module that I made.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:29.360
 You can see these lights match up with that because the on the 10 pin ribbon, that clock

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.760
 is shared, that that's the clock that's getting passed through the binary subsystem from Dresno.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.760
 Okay.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.240
 I guess this is like a lot of explanation and not a lot of context.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.640
 One of the really interesting things and one of the things I really like about it is I'm

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:50.280
 getting this seemingly chaotic gate pattern happening.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:56.040
 But because it's coming from a regular signal, it's repeating fairly regularly.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.280
 It's depending on the signal that you send it, it might take eight bars or a pretty long

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.280
 time for that fit.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.280
 I don't know if I can modify the thing that I made.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.280
 Why not do it?

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.280
 I mean, honestly, I don't know what the licensing for it is.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.280
 You know, it's not entirely stochastic.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.280
 Right.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280
 So yeah.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.280
 Yeah.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280
 Yeah.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280
 Yeah.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.280
 I'm a huge fan and I hope they make more modules.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.280
 I don't know if I can module if I, the thing that I made.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.280
 Why not do it?

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:36.080
 Like, if I, if I did, I probably would not go with Arduino was just, you know, this was

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.040
 the fastest way to do this.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:42.640
 I would probably come up with something, a different hardware demography in order to

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.640
 do this.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.360
 So it would be a lot more work to get there.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.360
 But and again, like I said at the beginning, this is niche of a niche of a niche of a niche.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.800
 If I do this, there might be five people on earth.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.800
 I want to buy it.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.200
 That'd be cool to do a limited run though.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.200
 Yeah.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.600
 Like I said before, like that was my first intelligible module was when he did the, I

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.520
 believe it was the live wire of Vulcan.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.520
 Yeah.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.520
 Yeah.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.520
 It was the Vulcan, right?

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.520
 Yeah.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.160
 And like there wasn't a whole lot of people out there at the time that had like the Vulcan

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.200
 modulator, you know what I mean?

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.800
 Or willing to spend a lot of money on something that was like as much as the actual module

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.760
 just to expand upon it.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.800
 But like, yeah, I love that thing.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.800
 Yeah.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.800
 You know what I mean?

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.160
 And it felt cool having something that was like, I don't know, like an underground

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.320
 release to expand upon something.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.320
 You know what I mean?

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.320
 I was like, this is a niche.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:38.560
 In this functionality, this ADC and DAC conversion is not that prevalent in your Iraq, but even

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.760
 in the synth world in general, I was talking to a friend of the podcast, Ryan, he might

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.760
 make music.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.040
 I've never asked.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:53.520
 But he reminded him of the G2 modular has an ADC conversion and a DA converter that

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.600
 I just got on, yeah, that reminded him of this and I ended up looking it up.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.320
 He sent me the documentation where I was like, yeah, it's very comparable to this.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.920
 Yeah, there's not much they could pitch about.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.560
 You're just reading pins from a signal from pins on a module.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.560
 Yeah.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.560
 It's not like there's anything.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.280
 It's not like you're trying to market it as a chaos device as a module.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.280
 Right.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.760
 Or they could have put some signature on the start or something that you would have had

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.760
 to figure out.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.080
 But it's obvious that I love them and I don't want them to be mad at me.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.080
 Right.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.080
 This is a work of passion.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.080
 Exactly.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.640
 I think they would be super psyched about this.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.120
 That's pretty cool.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.440
 Yeah, like I said, it was also a project I took on.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.760
 I wanted to see if I could do it.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.400
 But this was super fun.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.760
 There were definitely times where I'm like, I'm not getting this at all.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.800
 I'm like, totally on the wrong track and almost gave up and then, or in the morning.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800
 Persevered.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.360
 Well, mostly I just woke up in a fever sweat and go, wait, maybe it's this and then ran

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.000
 downstairs and got the scope and shit out.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.280
 I assume my partner thinks I've gone even crazier than usual.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.920
 So what do you want to do with the next?

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.480
 What's the next step?

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.920
 So I mean, like even idea why it's not even necessarily with that.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.920
 That's a good question.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.720
 Because like this module probably is as extended as it can get.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.600
 There's starting to think in different ways about like, you've got all of this data coming

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.160
 in in this weird way.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160
 What can you do with it?

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.440
 And like, I think some of the low hanging fruit has been done by chaos devices.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.800
 And even if I don't turn this into a module, I like the idea of having maybe even like

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:29.760
 a board off the side or like a project box off the side where I just have all the crazy

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.680
 things that I'm doing with it.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.200
 And I'm just, you know, just and I can keep adding to it.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.880
 Yeah, just being able to manipulate this dream at that low level.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.520
 That's pretty interesting in itself.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.520
 Exactly.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.960
 I wonder if you could do like just like live coding against it somehow, you know, or something

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.960
 like that.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.400
 Like cool, you're like manipulating this dream at a time somehow.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.080
 That's a really interesting idea.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.600
 Like it would be difficult with Arduino because you have to upload.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.320
 Oh, true, true, true stuff.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.840
 But that wouldn't prohibit you from connecting a keyboard to it and then having these sort

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.480
 of like free variables or like basically accessing memory as it's coming in.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.680
 The issue of other pins you could do things with the program.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680
 Exactly.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.680
 Right.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.120
 So I mean, it's circling around.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.240
 And so instead of updating the core program, the program itself is designed to incorporate

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.400
 these new inputs and behave on them accordingly.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.200
 That's a fucking brilliant idea.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.280
 I'm putting it here right now.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.280
 Probably going to steal that.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.280
 Yeah, please do.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.760
 That's an awesome idea.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.240
 That's crazy.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:40.320
 How long did you've been cracking up with remots or something?

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.840
 It's been about June, it's November.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.080
 So yeah, let's yeah.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:49.240
 I mean, it took over a month, well over a month, just to reverse engineer these pins and figure

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.240
 out how they work.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:56.840
 And then also, you know, I've got a pretty good understanding of electronics, but I didn't

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.840
 go to school for it.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.520
 So a lot of it was, you know, I think I need to put a resistor here.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.560
 Oh, no, that didn't work.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.560
 Yeah.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.280
 Somebody who was much better at that sort of low level, like electronics design would

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.680
 probably laugh and go.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.040
 I could I could have hammered that on a couple of hours.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:21.280
 It took me a long time to get to the point where I have the lights blinking, the even

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280
 the jacks.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.680
 Yes, something else I want to mention too.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:32.960
 I had never hooked up or read or sent data to a jack before and I end up using the mutable

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.960
 instruments schematics.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.960
 They work perfectly.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.960
 Oh shit.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.960
 Yeah.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.680
 Jack schematics and it worked like a charm and it even diode protected from being plugged

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.760
 in the wrong way.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.760
 That's awesome.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.760
 Yeah.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.760
 See if the day.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.760
 To the rescue once more.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.760
 Absolutely.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:56.760
 I hate to say Emily, but I think Amelie would be with an A. Yeah, like the movie.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.400
 Pretty sick, dude.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.400
 Yeah.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.400
 Thank you.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.400
 Cool stuff.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.400
 Very fun.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.400
 I love that case.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400
 Yeah, the case is rad.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.400
 Yeah.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400
 So I ran out of project boxes.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.160
 I like both of those cases.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.160
 Yeah.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.840
 This is a well, this one is because I've got a problem every time I go to like Goodwill

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.600
 or thrift store and there's just some old box.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.200
 Like, oh shit, it's like a dollar.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.960
 I'm like, I want to put something in that.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.080
 This was like a clarinet case.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.240
 I ripped everything out.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.840
 This is black hole cases.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.560
 I think they're from Ohio.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.640
 I just sort of happened upon them like a couple of years ago looking for a case and

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.840
 all of their stuff is this like textured.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.000
 Yeah, I remember you speaking highly of an angry, previous episode.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.840
 I don't think I've ever seen the actual case that you're talking about.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.240
 Oh, I probably never brought it around.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.240
 It's pretty cool.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.080
 It came with those little stands that it's on.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.240
 Oh, it came with these feet.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.880
 No, the stands were a random perfect circuit like sale.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.160
 They were like five bucks.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.160
 Damn.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.160
 And they like perfectly.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.640
 They say they were pretty well.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.240
 So I'm probably going to, if I ever need to get another case, I'm going to go to this

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.440
 because it just looks like old scientific equipment.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.440
 I love it.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.440
 It does.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.440
 At first, I thought it was something you constructed.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.560
 I was like, no, if they were to build that, it would look much more haggard.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.720
 I should be insulted, but I'm not.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.280
 You are a hundred percent correct.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.760
 You wouldn't use this pristine tolex.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.760
 Nah.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.760
 Those angles wouldn't be so right.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.880
 You would have peeled the leather from like an 80 year old couch.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:31.800
 It would look older and it would have cat scratches in it and some mold patches in it.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.800
 That is true.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.800
 Yeah.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.800
 Absolutely.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.800
 That rhymes.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.800
 Cat scratches and mold patches.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800
 Shit.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.800
 Damn.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.800
 That was a title.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.800
 That's the new episode.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.800
 Yeah.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.440
 What does that have to do with?

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.440
 No, very little.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.440
 It's just, it's great.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.440
 Don't worry about it.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.440
 Listen and find out.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.440
 Exactly.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.440
 And subscribe to our Patreon.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.440
 Yeah.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:58.120
 If you tell us how email you a pencil, we have stickers and rolling papers that I won't

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.120
 send you.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:05.600
 Well, now that we've dipped into the underbelly of modular, you want to talk about something

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:12.400
 that's very mainstream, maybe influencer level?

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.400
 Ooh.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.720
 I don't know who you might be talking about.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.440
 I'm talking about endorphins collaboration with Andrew.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.440
 Oh, fuck.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.440
 Wong.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.440
 Wong.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.440
 I always want to say, "Wang."

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.120
 Because it's an H, but I'm just stupid.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.920
 Andrew Huang for ghost.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.800
 We joked about it in the past.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.840
 We also made the joke that eventually one of us would end up with one.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.840
 Yeah.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.840
 Guess who did?

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.680
 It was me.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680
 Shocked.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.000
 You know what though?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 It's funny.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 I was generally shocked.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 I was too.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.520
 Like when you said you got one, I was like, "Holy shit, you did it."

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.160
 I tried to take a step back.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.200
 And I was like, "I'm going to look at this.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.680
 I'm going to ignore the influencer name that's all over it.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:04.720
 I'm going to ignore the fact that he is indeed an influencer and not a dark techno producer

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.760
 who's trying to collaborate for a dark techno module.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.200
 I'm just going to ignore all this.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.600
 I'm going to ignore the fact that endorphins has a track record of releasing buggy, noisy

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.440
 modules.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.480
 And I'm going to have an open mind and give it a fair shot.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.200
 It definitely sounds like you had an open mind.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.680
 I did.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.680
 I went into it with a clean slate, you know?

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.880
 Low expectations.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.920
 And I was still disappointed.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:40.440
 But I do have endorphins and Andrew to thank showing me what an overpriced shitty distortion

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:46.120
 module sounds like and pushing me in the direction to find a better alternative.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.120
 Ooh.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.680
 But yeah, I'll get to the alternatives in a moment.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.360
 I'm very excited to hear those, but I'm also very excited to hear your experience.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.360
 How long did you have it?

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.760
 I had Ghost for a week.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.680
 Okay, that's a pretty long trial.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.200
 But you didn't have a shot.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.160
 We've both ditched stuff in a day.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.160
 Yeah.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.240
 I gave it a fair shake, dude.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.240
 I did.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.840
 Like the first night, I wasn't that impressed with it.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.400
 Second night, like the thing I received it on like a Friday or something, I messed with

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.520
 it and I was like, hmm, you know, it's like, I'll dig deeper into this.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.520
 Maybe I'm missing something.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.600
 Spent the weekend with it, did a few patches.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.640
 I think you even posted an Instagram video and it was like semi satisfactory, but I realized

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.960
 like it was mostly because of the other modules that I had it involved with.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.960
 You know what I mean?

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.960
 Right.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.320
 So I tried to pick it apart, just piece by piece, learn each circuit because I was struggling

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:42.040
 to figure out how all of these effects that it has work well with each other because

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.640
 they just weren't.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:52.600
 For our listeners' sake, like this module is like an all in one solution for dark techno.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.600
 Supposedly.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:29:04.240
 It has a saturation circuit and a DJ style filter circuit, a compressor circuit, a reverb circuit

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.800
 and a delay circuit.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:12.200
 They're all supposed to work hand in hand to quickly and easily like dial in like a

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.080
 rumble kick or something to that extent.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.360
 And you can change the routing of these effects.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.240
 You don't need to manually patch one to the other.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:27.200
 There's like three separate modes that you can bounce through changes the internal working

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.960
 of these circuits.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:37.320
 On their own, each circuit was bad.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.320
 Yeah.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.320
 Yeah.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.960
 This is a module that does like a lot of things and it does all of them poorly.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.200
 Now is the idea supposed to be that you're not intended to use them individually that

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.200
 they are supposed to be the...

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200
 That's what I'm sure the figure out.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.840
 I was like, okay, maybe on their own, they suck.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.880
 The magic is probably with them all working hand in hand.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:03.960
 A network of things to form a cohesive sound.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.120
 Greater than the sum of their parts.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.120
 Like a human centipede.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.120
 Yeah.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.760
 And I failed to get anything that I enjoyed out of it in that regard as well.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.880
 I jotted some notes down about each.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.120
 So real quick, are you sending drum series, something bass line you're saying?

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.120
 No, I'm always...

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.120
 Okay.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.120
 Mainly.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.040
 I mean, I don't really do melodies.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.040
 Right.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.040
 From my understanding of the module, this was meant to be something that you would process

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.680
 like your techno kicks with.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.680
 Right.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.680
 You know, I mean, things like that.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.680
 They kind of sell it that way.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.680
 Yeah.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.680
 Right.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.360
 Anyone who knows anything about like producing that type of shit would look at the components

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.520
 of this module and say, oh yeah, that's all the shit that I'd typically do in my DAW

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:48.720
 or that's all the shit that I wire up in my module to get this sound.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.160
 So it was all right there.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.560
 Like these were carefully selected effects.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.200
 These weren't like flanger, phaser, you know what I mean?

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.200
 It wasn't meant to be a multi-factor.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.360
 Like this, as far as I could tell, had a pretty specific purpose.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.440
 And so I try to use it in that purpose, you know, for that purpose rather.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.960
 And it just wasn't hitting it.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:13.600
 Like the individual components just didn't seem to like jive with each other.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.560
 Like, oh, which is weird because then I see that module.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.800
 It reminds me of like the triptych, oh, little one.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.880
 I'm like, oh, this is like them trying to make like this thing.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.440
 The module that I do have works together.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.440
 Yeah.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.440
 And I've had it in a while.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.440
 Yeah.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.440
 And was a collaboration.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.440
 Yeah.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.440
 Mind you, totally.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.040
 By people that like actually work with that style music.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.040
 Yeah.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.040
 Basic boys noise.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040
 Yeah.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.920
 I actually had that jotted down here in my notes because I made that comparison mentally

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920
 as well.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.080
 Like this reminds me of the SSF triptych.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.080
 Right.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.520
 A collaboration with B2 Electronics.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.120
 Which most people don't even like think that because it's not all that.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.880
 It's not the main point of the module.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:58.280
 Like this was the fact that this was a collaboration was kind of pushed to the forefront before

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.320
 anything else.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.400
 Whereas like the triptych was not.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.480
 It's like it was an afterthought.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:08.600
 Like, oh, by the way, this module exists because we collaborated with these producers

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.160
 who gave their feedback.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.160
 Right.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:16.680
 And also I think it's Andrew from SSF generally makes like really solid circuits.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.480
 Like I love the SSF shit I've used.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.480
 Same.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.480
 Yeah.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.480
 Yeah.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.080
 I'm so I did try to keep an open mind.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.080
 Right.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.520
 Right off the bat, I'll say I did not have noise issues.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:35.560
 A few people that saw reported that on, you know, Mod Wiggler that they were having noise

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.560
 issues.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.560
 I didn't notice any noise.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.160
 So in that regard, no complaints.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:46.600
 But yeah, it just wasn't impressed with the module overall either.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.800
 Biggest complaint, because that's the first and foremost part of this module was the distortion

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.560
 and the saturation circuit.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:58.760
 It did it just like completely lacked character, in my opinion.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:04.640
 Like the more you turned it up, the muddier and mushier like the sound got.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:10.080
 It just instead of like enhancing the harmonics, it just kind of like suppressed them.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.400
 Like this was not a good distortion circuit.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.720
 I could think of many other preamps that would have been probably a better choice than whatever

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.120
 they, however they had this going.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.840
 Like it just did nothing for me.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.120
 So I was kind of just bypassing it.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:29.560
 I was using the multitude of other modules I have as a preamp first to go into this thing.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.800
 Did you have shaping options for the distortion?

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.560
 Like what are the op like what are the parameters you had for it?

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.840
 On the input you do have some shaping, which I thought was a nice touch.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.040
 There was like a tone control for like high pass low pass.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:48.560
 It was kind of like a pre filter before everything else, which is nice.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.920
 That I would like to see on more modules for sure.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.680
 But yeah, the saturation circuit itself I found just kind of lacking.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:05.480
 I found better character out of the volume knob, if you cranked it past like I guess

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.280
 around like five o'clock or so, it would start to add like some fuzz to the top end.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.280
 And that was kind of nice to get that going and then run into the filter first.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.600
 Like it just gave you a little bit of crunch.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.840
 It was like the saturation circuit just lacked anything like that.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.960
 So what was the, you were saying the saturation just made a lot louder and smooshy.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.360
 Yeah, it's not very good.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.000
 Is it analog?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.360
 I don't know.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.240
 I know the trick is mostly an all analog signal path.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:36.840
 I think I highly doubt this is because everything about it just kind of screamed like the reverb

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:42.040
 to the reverb was the absolute like words.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.040
 It is.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.040
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:49.840
 Like the before I got me further, let me point out that I did only have this for a week.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:54.840
 And within that week, they released, I think it was six different firmware revisions.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.840
 Whoa, whoa.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:01.920
 We like bug fixes bug fixes and changing the characteristic of the filter of the delight,

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.000
 like a lot of things changing with it.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.520
 So I didn't install any of these.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.440
 I didn't want to be bothered.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.200
 I was playing with this thing out of the box fresh from release.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.320
 I got it within 48 hours of it being officially released from Detroit modular.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.440
 So it was like, you know, fresh off the truck.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.560
 One to see what it had to offer.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.440
 I did not want to be messing around with firmware updates at that point.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.440
 Yeah.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.800
 As someone who does QA, it's done QA quite a bit in their career.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.280
 This is screaming.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.280
 There was no QA.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.280
 Yeah.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.320
 No one has this six releases, especially like right after the release, like it was like,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.440
 Oh shit, we fucked this up.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.440
 Yeah.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.800
 I don't know if it was a fuck up or if like other people just had some of the similar

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.520
 complaints that I did and brought it to their attention.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.120
 I know that in some of the patch notes, if you open it up in the firmware folder, it

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.920
 says like this was suggested by Andrew.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.400
 Like after the fact, like the last one, I think it was on November 3rd.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.680
 But why didn't they have those conversations before?

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.680
 Before he released.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.520
 That was what I was wondering as well.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.960
 He's a busy influencer.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:07.080
 But the reverb, yeah, like you only have two like main functions with it.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.200
 You can adjust the pre delay, which I do enjoy.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:15.400
 I love shucking with pre delay on reverb when it comes to progressive processing.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.320
 That was a nice touch.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:23.040
 That aside from the decay is like the only options you have with this reverb.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.040
 Wow.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.680
 So limited, you got to make sure it's like a pretty decent reverb, right?

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:33.280
 It's like no, like the minute you tend to push it with anything percussive, it just

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.280
 got sloppy.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:40.520
 Does it have like options for material like like plate or cathedral or room size or anything?

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.160
 Nope.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:46.760
 It just kind of sounded like clouds reverb with a pre delay option basically.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.400
 Yeah, it wasn't very good.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.400
 Wasn't very clear.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.000
 I noticed in the patch notes in the most recent one on the third, it said added shimmer.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.240
 Towards the end of the tale for more lushness.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:05.320
 Again, I think you just like misreading the intent of your own module at that point.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:10.880
 Like why if it's meant to be for percussive slash techno processing, why would you want

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.880
 shimmer?

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.880
 Yeah.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.560
 You would want instead, like you're saying the ability to go through like hall plate,

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.120
 you know, spring, things like that.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:25.160
 Very shocked to get any kind of reverb that isn't the most like basic $5 guitar pedal

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.440
 that didn't have those type of options.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:31.000
 Especially with so much on that module, so much shit surfaced.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.560
 I can't believe one of those isn't a toggle for at least three different.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:40.280
 It's because they dedicated so much space for the big stupid DJ filter knob on the top.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280
 Like I gotcha.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:48.280
 It's like 25% of the face plate is for the giant frequency knob for the DJ style filter,

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.720
 which I found to be very limited in range either.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.880
 There was like two sweet spots that I found that I was happy with.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.800
 The resonance didn't seem to like add or even take away from the resonance.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.160
 It was just kind of like maybe that changed in the firmware.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.160
 I don't know.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.560
 You have all the things to maybe skip to like dual dagger does a great job of that DJ style

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.200
 resonant filter like leave that out focus on the other stuff.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.200
 Yeah.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.280
 It's all stereo too.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.480
 It's all stereo and that was the main appeal for me.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:29.280
 But upon messing with it, there's nothing you can really do with the stereo field anyways

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.360
 and everything coming out of it sounded like mono anyway.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.400
 So it's kind of pointless.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.360
 Especially if it's meant to be a percussive module.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.360
 I don't know.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:47.080
 I see someone may be getting enjoyment out of this thing as an end of chain processor,

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.080
 maybe.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.080
 Right.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.080
 The delay was decent.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.080
 I was just going to ask you.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.280
 I did like the delay.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.600
 It had a wide range.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:57.880
 I could go into like car plus territory or up to 2.5 second.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.880
 It's cool.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.880
 Nice.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.880
 It had a tone adjustment so you could just like the brightness and the darkness of it.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:04.880
 Feedback on it.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.880
 I don't remember.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.880
 Okay.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.680
 I want to say yes.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.520
 But I did have fun like see being the delay.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.280
 It could kind of get glitchy and stuff.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.280
 No, that's cool.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.520
 It was a neat circuit.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.320
 The only one that offered like actual character out of the whole thing.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:28.160
 And then you know at the end of it all you have a compressor which has no options.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.240
 It's just one knob.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.800
 And for threshold is that all or like what was it?

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.640
 What did that knob control?

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.640
 I don't know.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.120
 Probably maybe a few things sometimes.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120
 I think it was a multi-function.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:45.200
 I think the more you turned it the more it adjusted like attack decay release rather.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.200
 Okay.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.480
 I think she is.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.400
 But again it just it didn't have much character.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:58.480
 Like I have a couple WMD muscle compressors which are also stereo just three knobs and

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.160
 you can get a lot of character out of that thing.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.160
 A lot of gain.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.680
 A lot of interesting results.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:08.280
 Well, I mean that's also a focused module that they would not.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.200
 That's the thing if you're going to release a module that is like supposed to be a Swiss

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:17.800
 army knife like an all-in-one solution so that you don't go the route of like needing

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.160
 to get individual modules to do all the same things like then it has to have some character

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:28.840
 to it or you know at least be slightly comparable to some of the smallest modules out there

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.520
 that do similar functionality.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.080
 Because it was also very expensive.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.080
 It's big and expensive.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.080
 It's like a 500 dollar module.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.080
 Oh no shit.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.080
 Okay.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.280
 I want to say like 450 something.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280
 Yeah.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.240
 But it's not even like you're like okay someone out there who's starting out they're going

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.160
 to save a lot of money by getting this instead of building their own.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.160
 Right.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.920
 Signal chain but you could put all of those modules together.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.880
 Smaller versions of the modules that do a better job for about the same price.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.360
 That's exactly what I did.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.360
 Yeah.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.880
 I wanted to give it a shot.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.840
 I mean the thought is appealing.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.160
 Have a stereo module.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.880
 You know the handles all these things.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.880
 You're saving space.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.040
 You're saving money.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.560
 You can reroute it internally without even half in the patch cables.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.800
 But at the end of the day it reminded me why I like modular.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.800
 Yeah.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.800
 Yeah.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:24.040
 You know because like it did not really cut it and I'm like okay this is exactly why

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.520
 I want modular in the first place to avoid these locked in the box.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.520
 Bound together thing.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.520
 Type of results.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.280
 Yeah that just weren't satisfying to me.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.120
 Or if they've done some really interesting deep research and was like this is the common

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.000
 combination of things and we came up with this network that was really interesting but

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.680
 it needed to have all of these things in one box.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.320
 If there was something truly novel about that in a relationship between the components

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.920
 then it would work.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:51.840
 It just sounds like they just threw three things in a box and good luck.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.880
 Yeah and you know I love my distortion.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.880
 Yeah.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.920
 I would have been able to like justify keeping it if the distortion was interesting just

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:01.920
 alone.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.920
 You know what I mean?

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:03.920
 Like that is it.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:09.240
 I would have kept it on its own just for a nice stereo distortion but like it just wasn't

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.240
 there man.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.840
 You know I mean it just did not cut it.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.840
 Didn't cut it.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.960
 Returned it to Detroit modular after a week.

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.280
 And then used that money to get more interesting modules.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.240
 Yeah.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:28.480
 And that is my ghost rant.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.480
 I should have trusted my gut instinct and avoided.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.720
 I bet it may mean me too.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.720
 Someone was gonna have to get it.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.720
 We know.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.720
 Now I know.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.800
 I saw it with my own eyes.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.480
 Had to learn the hard way.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.000
 Not to knock like Andrew Wong like.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.200
 Yeah.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.680
 Some of his YouTube videos I find amusing.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.680
 Most of them I don't.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:56.360
 But like you know it's like if you're going to collaborate why not stick to something that's

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.360
 your wheelhouse.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.360
 You know what I mean?

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.360
 Like yeah.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.700
 Angry distortion multi effect dark techno module I think you might have stepped too far

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.240
 out of his own.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.240
 I don't associate him.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.240
 Confident.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.240
 Those works.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.240
 Exactly.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.240
 Yeah.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.240
 Exactly.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.240
 So.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.620
 And I saw some demos like you know all the influencers were using this thing for the first

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.080
 week of its race.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.620
 I saw a couple like people using it in ambient patches and things like that and I'm like

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:26.440
 maybe using it in that regard like in a subtle manner.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.940
 It could.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:28.940
 It could work.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.260
 But again like if you're.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.800
 If you have an ambient modular rig you're probably already knowing what you want and

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.320
 one of those things is going to be a nice reverb and that is not what you're going to

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.720
 find on ghost and the fairly you want something with a lot of options a lot of CV a lot of

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.680
 modulation a lot of choices.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.680
 Yeah.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.600
 So I don't know who's going to like really enjoy this module plan.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:58.440
 Just see like if it flops or if I'm you know just preaching to the choir to other people

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.540
 that are very try to found themselves disappointed with it or on the fence about buying it for

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.780
 the most part I've not seen a lot of videos with it.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.540
 I mean there's a lot of influencers.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:07.540
 Yeah.

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.540
 Yeah.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.840
 I haven't really seen people like passionately using this thing or putting videos out there

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.340
 showing what can be done with it in an interesting way.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.620
 Well thank you for stepping into the plate and taking one for the team.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.620
 Yes sir.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.620
 Because I don't want to buy that thing.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:21.620
 Or get the research.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.620
 Save us the money.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.620
 Speaking of disappointing things.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.520
 Aren't you hopping to the electron corner with me for a little bit.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.520
 Oh let's step in.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.320
 Yeah we've got some things to talk about today.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.320
 We have a little robust electron corner.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.400
 Do we ever come up with like a little jingle or something to like introduce this like segment

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.760
 of maybe I can work on that and the electron only jingle.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.760
 Yes yeah.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.280
 Oh it's only with an analog four.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.280
 Yeah.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.280
 Yeah neither do I.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.080
 If anyone has an analog four and wants to make us a jingle.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.080
 Oh yeah.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.060
 We'll send you a goozy and a number two pencil.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.060
 Yeah.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.580
 Some rolling papers if you want some stickers.

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.580
 But regardless.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:04.540
 So it was getting ready for a live set and you know doing the first half of that which

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:08.420
 is system config usually for me or at least at that point it was.

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.180
 I was like trying to figure out what to use.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:16.660
 Got the bug up my ass to determine that an electron syntax was in my future.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:17.660
 Yeah.

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.500
 Yeah and it was you know been out for a little.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.260
 I'd heard some samples and I was like shit.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.440
 Maybe this is the thing it's got synthesizer in it.

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:30.240
 I'd descoped I'd taken the modular out of my set which I was very glad about that worked

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.960
 out really well actually because I was trying to get that to work and like.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.600
 Didn't really get where I wanted.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:41.360
 I was like damn the syntax can do what my rhythm does and it could do sense shit and

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:46.880
 I could take it out live and it could be small and yeah.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.240
 Got it.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.840
 One day back out back to what was it?

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.840
 Sweet water.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:59.080
 Thank you sweet water for taking another return from me for no price.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:03.540
 Be it for multiple reasons I got it and it's maybe because I've had an electron rhythm

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:10.280
 for a long time now mark one and the mark two and all the drum synthesis there was such

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:15.300
 a great overlap for the rhythm like all the analog shit I was like well this is identical

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.560
 to what I already have.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.640
 They didn't really push anything at all.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:24.080
 There was one machine and I think it was like a conga machine or something like that.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:31.400
 And it was okay but it had like this little range of sound and first off like I hate the

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.240
 small size digi boxes.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.840
 The 8 by 2 step ones.

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.000
 I am not a fan.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.400
 That is not a pleasurable way to program.

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.400
 Yeah.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:47.080
 It just doesn't work for me they've like focused on very cute graphics on these new things

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.080
 too.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.880
 Like a like teenage engineering OP one style.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.880
 Very much style as far as they can push like the black and white display and some of that

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.360
 is okay and some of it was just distracting and it was like oh I see where your focus is

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:03.680
 when I'm using it like I would rather they push the sound design a little more had more

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:10.920
 like machine drum style drum engines the FM things were like the model cycles FM engine

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.960
 for like chords and like drums and shit like that put on there and it like doesn't sound

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:20.840
 good editing the chord stuff is like this weird like it's a very cute graphic but it

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:26.440
 is not like something a musician like not that I'm that necessarily but like to figure

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.600
 out which chord I wanted to play was kind of a nightmare whereas on the half act it's

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:34.000
 like let me set it to major or minor and then pick like harmonica or like jazz or blues

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.640
 or something like that like that's how my brain kind of works.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.720
 This was more like scan through a bunch of different chord types and the sound was like

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.960
 really unsatisfying I did not like the synth engines.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:52.080
 The filter sound kind of similar to the rhythm not as good to me not analog well maybe they

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.280
 are either way like wasn't too impressed with it.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:00.840
 Also I realized too only the analog four in the electron rhythm have the feature called

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.720
 direct jump which means you can have a pattern playing switch pattern you can be on step

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:10.080
 six of pattern one switch to pattern two and it will start on step seven of pattern two

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.880
 so you can like really quickly go back and forth like you see any video of Derek basic

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:19.280
 uses the hell out of this feature to like do like cut up jungle breaks and things like

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:24.080
 that it's just like I need to work that way I'm so used to the rhythm being able to do

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:28.360
 that and this couldn't it was always at the end of four bars or at the end of a bar and

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:33.080
 it's like that's kind of a bummer for me with a drum machine something where I like I need

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:37.080
 to be able to make changes quickly and I think honestly they've just like kind of fucked

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:41.480
 up their architecture by like not having that be a feature on all their new shit I don't

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:46.880
 see why I honestly assumed that it was I did I did not know that it was yeah and then

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:52.640
 I was like oh right they can do this it's simply just a shift and select next pattern

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.680
 like something you have to make another set of buttons or anything like it's pretty simple

00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:00.920
 to set up see this gross like armchair programming thing and be like isn't it just a pointer to

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:05.320
 like another memory location which is how it works like perfectly on the analog rhythm

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:10.320
 like you can it never fucks up it does it just great analog four is the same way too

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:16.520
 um so I got this and even the digi machines on it are so fucking bland for the most part

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:21.720
 like the kick drums sound like pretty close to the analog ones and there's just nothing

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:28.920
 that interesting in any of it um I don't know there was just a lot of for the price and the

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:34.040
 sound quality and the synthesizers being like not that fun to use and honestly just like

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:41.720
 the dual VCL on the rhythm um it just kind of fucking bored the shit up if it's your first

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:46.200
 electron yeah it's probably a good pick I'm spoiled by having used these things for a

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:51.640
 long time machine drum octa track rhythm all these things that was gonna be my main question

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.840
 for you like how does it stack up to the machine drum which is pretty much impossible to not

00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:02.040
 even use the not even shadow when I first saw it released I thought that was my interpretation

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:08.920
 I was like oh this is this is the machine drum mark three you know a mono machine a machine

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:13.320
 drum shit in a box I would have been I would still have it I probably would have used it live

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.720
 because that stuff is unique and like even if you can't use the same code I don't know why they

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:22.680
 can't like just try to remake some of those drums right and kind of get like close to that would

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:29.160
 probably sound good just to try to get there just by ear or whatever um one cool thing about it is

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:34.200
 those modifier tricks so it's like however many tracks I forget how it breaks down but you've got

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:39.880
 like four modifier trig tracks on the last four and those let you do things like drum rolls or

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:44.920
 like other changes to the pattern and that I thought was like some good innovation on the

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:49.000
 sequel so it's to the pattern not the actual synth yeah since of this engine okay so I think

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.200
 could you map them to like a parameter in the synthesis engine no you can map them to different

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:59.320
 parameters within the seek once or engine they're trig modifiers so they're right solely

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:04.600
 operating on that okay remember it seems like a little bit of a missed opportunity to

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:13.720
 not be able to take that and modulate the synthesis engine itself or parameters in it yeah it's a

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:20.120
 good idea and I hope like again we've said this before I want them to get back to making full-size

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:27.080
 machines that are very playable they've kind of come up with these small boxes that just aren't

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.720
 very nice to use and they look like nice and tidy and they're small for taking out to play live but

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:37.000
 like you're used to an electron rhythm and you go to that it is a big disappointment in ways at least

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:45.240
 for me it was having no like good drum pads no scenes or from parameter pads or anything like

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:51.080
 that there's just a lot of stuff missing from it to me and that's the same form factor and buttons

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:56.520
 as the digit act right yeah like they're nice to like add to a sequence like I like them on the

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:01.960
 rhythm mark two and the octray mark two which I'll talk about but to play like for a pad thing it

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:09.000
 just like kind of balls fly for me um it had another LFO that was cool they had some other like incremental

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:18.120
 updates but overall so the synth engine itself could you get into like weird like glitchy drums or

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:24.760
 weird just sort of like space laser drums like how a little bit like what variety of drum sounds

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.840
 could you make with that engine not like a strong variety like i'm saying like you can maybe like

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:35.960
 it's very analogish um some of the FM stuff you could twist a little bit but the thing about the

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:41.640
 synthesis stuff and the chords and anything like that is that it was ended up being so basic like

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:48.120
 the FM parameters or it's like their version of it instead of just like a regular like two-op setup

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:53.640
 and give me some like classical controls over and they try to like put this cute interface over

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:59.960
 top of it um and that just really didn't I didn't vibe with that at all I did not enjoy using it um

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:05.960
 yeah it was a very quick disappointment actually it just really wasn't into it at all

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:16.440
 that wasn't good sold it um but then eventually got back in bed with an octetrack it had been

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:22.280
 I figured out six years since I'd sold the octetrack I used to had one since it came out

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:28.440
 um it was a beta tester of for it throughout the entire development of the operating system for

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:33.400
 the most part except for the first few releases um got really used to that thing to the point

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:38.360
 where I sold it because I was so sick of it and what it did and then this live set I was mixing

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:44.440
 with an echlear new o2 DJ mixer which was great and then just kind of weird moment I was using the

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:48.920
 rhythm mark too and I was like man love how I can use this thing in the dark and there are LEDs

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:53.160
 under the buttons and then I had this moment and I was kind of fucking baked and I was like new

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:59.640
 octetrack does that too I opened up this chat with uh Luke and my friend Gabbo and I was like

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:05.240
 I don't think I'm gonna do it but I think I'm gonna get an octetrack went back to making my set go

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.400
 back to the chat both of them had purchased octetrack in this five minute period and they were like

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:14.840
 why are you getting yours like it was like holy shit like that's like they were the ones I packed

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:21.560
 oh yeah all three of us got these from different places in the same day because it turned out um

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:27.640
 the fucking euro to dollar conversion you could get them from toman for like 1250 um

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:33.000
 it's a weird beast I was really excited at first I'm like oh it's got balanced inputs now it has

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.960
 some new buttons and that shit like the new buttons are great like the ui's a little better

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:45.480
 same shitty sounding octetrack as before like the quality and like it's kind of a bummer mixing

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:50.360
 pieces of gear through it so like the digitack was the first one I think they had that sort of

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:56.200
 greatly improved sound engine or the very least the output sounded really good

00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:03.320
 that was made after that right yeah and it has um it can tolerate higher input levels kind of

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:08.600
 but it's still like the way it sums it or something it's just like really kind of fiddly to get

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.880
 like when you ab it against the mixer it's like all their frequencies just fucking gone right

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:19.960
 you know and for like a live set at collision I can roll with it you know like it's that collision

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:25.400
 well you know at any place really like it'll work for like how much fidelity you're gonna get in

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:31.720
 a club for the most part um and the transition tricks like I use the I've been using the easy

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:37.720
 bot template he made this live performance template um for mixing two pieces of gear and that's what

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:43.240
 it's kind of I'm using it kind of dumb like just no patterns just one pattern um use a bunch of

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.960
 different parts with different effects that he has set up and for transitioning it's fucking

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:53.800
 magical like it's undeniable like you can loop this thing fade over your loop plays introduce a new

00:55:53.800 --> 00:56:00.120
 part and cross back over like it opens up a lot of live performance stuff you can overuse it like

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:05.560
 any shitty DJ effect if you do it too much and it's like oh you're gonna like do the high pass thing

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:11.880
 again with the DJ filter and that's cool um but it does that part is fun and sounds pretty good um

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:17.000
 now I have like a four machine set up instead of five it's a little more compact so in that way

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:23.960
 it's a success I have it mainly because I realized it's like riding this shitty weird bike once you

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:28.920
 get on it and like all the muscle memory was there even when I was like I was automatically

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:34.520
 like double tapping track to get the stuff like shift up to get to the mute and the delay control

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:39.800
 stuff like it all came back that was weird for not having it for six years but in this like new

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.640
 version that looks kind of different and I was like this is just it was tripping me out the first

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:49.720
 couple of years man I put a lot of time into that thing back in the day he did a tremendous amount

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:55.480
 so like it's nice it's cool to like sample the modular you know I'm gonna keep it around just

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:59.800
 for that purpose I don't know we'll see how it works in this live set it's made the cut so far

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:08.920
 um but it's more fun to mix with the DJ mixer I just thought it kind of sounded better but

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:15.960
 yeah electron corners um thumbs up kind of on the octuract one thumb up and one thumb like kind

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:21.000
 of sideways two thumbs down on the syntax man they should just make like they'll make some

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:29.240
 digi-loop someday or something like that um it's just always so close but so far uh but it's cool

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.880
 shout out to easybot for the performance thing it works pretty well it's a little overkill for

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:41.240
 me but i'm tweaking it as i go um also rehearsal for live set shit today was cool so it'd be funny

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.920
 i'm excited to throw tomatoes at you i thank you it's just kind of wild that you're back in the

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:50.200
 octa track full man now i do um the new buttons are cool the new heart it's beautiful new hardware

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:57.400
 the new like black one yeah it's it's pretty slick um good size again it's like 16 steps in like the

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:01.480
 old mark one chassis it's like there was something kind of nice about these things they just

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:07.640
 felt right to use you know the i hope if they redo it they don't shrink it down into that fucking

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:12.200
 box right man i forgot to that like i didn't realize that electron has been bought by at least

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:18.840
 one holding company since like 2016 who kind of like i don't know who makes the decisions but

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:24.040
 like other people came in and bought like 40 some percent of the company but i think that's why

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:29.080
 they're i'm really bad at paying attention to like that anymore anything has to do with business

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:35.080
 yeah i don't pay close attention to so do you know who the uh the secret holding company is that

00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:41.400
 bottle i forget i just read the name the other day the Illuminati holding company and also they

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:46.600
 don't uh give me the beta tester to scount anymore so fuck you guys now well you're not beta testing

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:53.640
 anymore i have not been a beta tester for many years since the rhythm mark one kind of

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:58.360
 stop and i think they just changed their beta program or something but that did get me a

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:06.440
 sweet rhythm mark two for a discount i was glad i got that does that thus end electron corner yeah

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:10.360
 we haven't had an electron corner in a minute um-hmm hasn't been much electron stuff

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:15.960
 it was mostly positive no actually i think it was mostly negative because two thumbs down and

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:22.520
 then like thumbs up in the thumbs sideways i think the net is just below a sideways thumb i do like

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:28.040
 having the octur track it's cool just to like you know have something there's a lot of value and

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:33.400
 just knowing how to use an instrument too and being able to do stuff and it's been fun also i'm

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:36.440
 glad you're uh i'm glad you're digging it i'm glad it wasn't like you got it and then was like

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:41.480
 like going back and watching a movie that you love from your childhood holy shit this is way

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:45.160
 more racist than homophobic than i remember

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:54.840
 varesky mastering the a-r-e-s-c-h-i mastering dot

00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:58.280
 call

00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:08.200
 i'm done with this project and it sounds bad what do i do how about varesky mastering

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:18.040
 that cool philippe will work with you to get you where you want your sound to fucking go

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:26.200
 v-a-r-e-s-c-h-i mastering dot com philippe will help you with your sonic issues

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.720
 *farting*

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:34.040
 yeah so um yeah i guess the only thing the only other thing on my list and i don't have it with me

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.320
 um but i feel like i should talk about it because it's um

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:45.800
 not big i think it was a it was a big release a big deal uh cubit

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:53.400
 nautilus yeah i took i took the uh pulled the trigger took the dive um i resisted and i was

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:58.840
 glad to hear that you pulled the trigger i was like good i will wait and see the results

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:06.040
 so um i've been i've been cheering on a lot because i really wanted to come in here with a

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:12.280
 more concrete yes no thumbs up thumbs down i wanted it to be a little bit more binary

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:18.120
 my words my what i'm going to say is it's a lot of conditions it's a it's really wishy

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:27.080
 washy in a way that i just i'm i'm i'm i'm uncomfortable um so it's uh for listeners who don't know

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:34.760
 what this is it is a big um delay network thing that cubit has done and it's all nautical themed

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:41.640
 um and it has this um he sort of sewn our controls that have manipulation over this eight

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.760
 eight delay line um network that inter operates with itself and it's got a lot of what you would

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:53.720
 expect out of play circuit you know um it does the simple things simple but it also has this

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.920
 complication it's cubit they they over you know they're gonna add stuff to it yeah it's always

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.920
 gonna be a shift button yeah well it's funny because they even have a little thing it's like

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:07.960
 no shift buttons this time oh which is a lie there's shifts like a how you see it yeah like how you

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:13.640
 set the input control and uh the reset is by with a shift button i was like how do you how did you

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:19.400
 not notice how did the editors for this document not notice there's no you'll notice there's no shift

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:25.720
 two pages later there's a shift function um which is whatever my complaints are going to be

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:34.040
 far deeper than poor documentation um a lot of a lot of the um modulation is surfaced you can

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:42.040
 you can see me a lot of it um and it has a unique somewhat unique um output um which i believe

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:49.320
 is called seonar is the output um and it's a stepped gate representation of what's going on

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:55.960
 inside the network um which was honestly probably the most appealing thing to me like yeah i don't

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:03.400
 go to relay lines that often in what i'm working on things it's something i go to if i or if i

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:10.120
 use it i use it very sparingly very sort of like tight tight delays um so that's what i was like

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:16.200
 oh maybe this is something that'll maybe open this up to me using these sort of more i watch a bunch

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:22.280
 of demos on youtube and definitely got a little bit of that like oh these all sound the same i hope

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:29.320
 this doesn't just sound like the one thing um i'm gonna say that it it sounds that you can get more

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:36.760
 out of it than what's on the the demos and that what the sound is and i guess this is on brand or

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:43.320
 on theme um it's very aquatic sound it sounds like it's underwater it sounds like it's sort of

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:49.320
 whale song yeah it's sort of like the the the the dolphins mating in the spring exactly like the

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:55.720
 delay sounds like it's traversing through water and it has this sort of like i mean i don't think they

01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:02.440
 want people use the word muddy i think it sounds it comes across a little muddy a little subdued

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:10.440
 just so much of the high end is just gone huh plasticy maybe that's the plasticy that you were

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:15.880
 talking about i'm telling you man all cute bit modules sound like plastic to me i can't describe

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:21.080
 it but it all has this plastic bucket characteristic that i can never ignore the aurorops like that

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:26.840
 you know yes yeah i think it was probably the least right of cubit modules that i heard that had but

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:33.400
 it still had that plasticy tone to it yeah i mean and honestly this is the first cubit module that i

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:41.720
 that i bought and have like dove into so um and there was a weird thing to where they um there's a

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:48.200
 feedback knob and it goes to infinity but and beyond but even have a little note in the

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:54.680
 documentation that's like don't worry we've made it so that it doesn't get out of control if you

01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:00.840
 hit it to infinity yeah like some sort of built-in limiter or whatever yeah it actually kind of just

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:07.880
 makes it useless honestly it doesn't it doesn't go to infinity it doesn't go near it just it it

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.600
 one of the analogies i kept coming back to when i was using this was

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.760
 did you ever see something like kids uh learning how to bowl and they fill the lanes with like

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:23.160
 the bumpers a bumpers bumper bowl so that you can't that's the whole time i'm using it i'm like

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:28.440
 i feel like they just put these little bumpers around here and everything's like like that's not

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:33.000
 gonna sound good so we've cut that off that's not gonna sound good so you can't do that there's a

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.680
 lot of controls and there's a lot of different modes for both um there's a freeze button with

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:43.960
 input on gate and high there's different modes for the different network configuration and there's

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:50.600
 even like different feedback modes but all of them feel like i'm playing bumper bowl like i'm

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.680
 bumper bowl and i'm like okay let's let's step out let's step a little outside of this and it's

01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:01.080
 like no this is that's as far as you're gonna go it's very like that sound you're getting and you hear

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:07.720
 basically when you start it up you're gonna get very there's variations and the different um

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:15.160
 aquatic theme sort of controls outside of just um resolution and reverse have this effect on

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:22.520
 this network and there they're so subtle as to be pointless like maybe if i was a very very

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:30.280
 like in tuned ambient fanatic who heard those sort of slight differences and i really relish

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:35.080
 them this would be very exciting but it was actually i have jammed on these knobs and i've

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:41.480
 sent a bunch of cv in a moduli of the shot of them and it just sounds like too preset and too

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:49.960
 digitally perfect yeah it and it's it's very nice i will everything i've sent through it sounds

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:59.720
 nice even just garbled nonsense or a sine wave or everything and it's the basically once it hits

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:07.560
 past that first tap it immediately just becomes like oh it's here you go you're soothing except

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:15.000
 this is a big accept there's a chroma knob and it has the chroma is basically these different effects

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.120
 or i don't think they use the word effects it's basically different sort of operations on the network

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:25.400
 hmm they're all nautical named and shit um but like basically there's like a crush there's a

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.920
 it's sort of like different and there's a depth of mountains wine barnacle

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:38.120
 so when you get to titans wank which is around tova um and there's a depth knob on it all of them

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:43.240
 just like all of that low end that had been i mean i'm sorry all of the high end that had

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:50.120
 has been buried under the sea all comes to the surface and just is this icy crunchy no matter

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:55.000
 what the fuck you're sending it no matter what you're doing you turn that chroma knob and any of

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.160
 that depth all it is and that's it those are your two modes of operations with the same i had it for

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:07.880
 probably a couple of weeks now and i've given it a lot of chances i really do want to like this

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:15.400
 um those are the two modes and the sonar is so obtuse there's it's this idea that you have this

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:23.480
 like um exposure to this complicated network it's basically just a random step function there's no

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:29.000
 it's not like you can use it and go okay cool the network's doing this and now i'm going to take that

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.440
 modulation and do something else with it which is really what i wanted to do i'm looking at an

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:39.560
 escape going yeah this is just fucking random as shit it's random gates it's just random

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:44.680
 step random step okay it's it's uh fucking use it i didn't realize it was step i thought it was just

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:52.280
 gates there's there's a different mode you can see in the um the online uh the web-based settings

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:55.400
 page which actually wasn't that bad i was a little worried i may mention this in the last

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:59.400
 episode i was really worried about the settings page being this web page thing that was actually

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:05.560
 i was you're okay with it it's there's like 12 options they're all super straightforward you put

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.800
 them in put them on a little usb thing you stick it in that was actually actually that's one of the

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:15.320
 things i'm most positive about with this one of them is you then change it to pings you have these

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:20.840
 gates you know it's okay these different gates but the one that i was like oh i want to step out but

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.640
 i want the what the secret song with the guts i want them spilling out these guts

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:32.920
 fucking useless fucking useless the only thing i mean it's tempo synced i'll give it that um but yeah

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:39.560
 it's it's and massively disappointed the other thing is at the same time like a day later i got

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:46.920
 the sound of shadows from you Nick this is v3 um from flight of harmony it's everything i fucking

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:52.520
 want in a delay it's fucking perfect like if you did you take to it absolutely love it so

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:57.160
 not all this is probably gone and i'm probably gonna keep that it's feedbacks like it's fucking

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:03.320
 gnarly sound of shadows is like an unfuck with a ball classic on my list of delays i feel like

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:09.480
 pt delay from bug brand and sound of shadows are both like can't fuck with them it was a little

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:15.880
 word this is the v3 and yeah and but it's because the v2 is the bigger one and it's because the

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:21.880
 vca yeah after vca which kind of it doesn't matter this still sounds fucking amazing and i

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:29.880
 huge thumbs up for like a ten year old uh flight of harmony module um if you were

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:34.360
 and that's why i guess sort of circling back around to my like review of this is

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.560
 there's probably people out there that are seeing these demos of

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:42.920
 novelism going that's what i want if that is exactly what you want and you

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:49.000
 don't want too much variety from that Cyrus loves his fucking go for it you're gonna you're

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.280
 you'll have it for days i'm sure they're gonna keep working on it um i like how i keep finding

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:59.080
 ways to work syrus in as a reoccurring character we should have him on some time we should i mean

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.640
 that we would have to believe out his perspective on modular is unlike any of us three i'm sure

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:08.360
 sure like and i'm not surprised to hear that he liked this and that's not a dig at him at all

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:14.520
 it really is just a different way of approaching it and it's exactly what he wanted yeah it's very

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:22.040
 hard to get into a bad sound everything just sounds like oh that's nice that's nice i wonder if

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:27.640
 someone could make a alt firmware where they take the bumpers off hmm i think that would be a

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:33.480
 astounding it or even if they made something even if they made a version of that was like hey listen

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:39.000
 we've i wouldn't be surprised i mean the aurora already has at least one other firmware now from

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.120
 them and that's why i'm keeping it honestly yeah like i'm i'm gonna give this a shot to see

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:51.160
 if they open it up a little if it if it expands beyond the sort of very limited and again it's

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:59.160
 nice like i'm not that much of a third dog that i can't recognize that this is a nice sound it's just

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:05.080
 fucking useless for me take the bumpers off and create some sort of like bbd emulation

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:10.440
 to give it a little bit more character if that happens yeah i will have a completely different

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:16.600
 review of that and i will come back and i will be fucking excited for it but until then it's

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.520
 probably just gonna sit in a box you know i cubit we're just giving them away for free here

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:29.960
 yeah so i i don't know i i i wish i'd something more concrete or definitive it's a pretty good

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:35.880
 review thank you and that was it though that's all i that's really the alpha and a mega of my list i

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:44.440
 have another bullet point on my list that encompasses a couple different modules actually oh um distortion

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:52.280
 it's kind of circles back to use office speak oh so you're using distortion that's cool i mean

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.920
 it's about time you started exploring it as dorche an options i've never looked into it before

01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:02.200
 i was like you know it's time to try it out always so safe with the levels great always like maybe a

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:12.120
 little lower so my my complete disappointment of ghosts as you know a saturation module led me on a

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:20.840
 hunt for something new i i mean i definitely have enough distortion module but i wanted more

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:27.400
 wanted to try something fresh something good um so i dipped into a couple different things

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:34.200
 first thing i dipped into was schlappy engineering um i'm sure that's not how you pronounce that schlappy

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:39.880
 nigget i don't know schlappy i think your maybe your ex schlappy the way you're saying it is probably

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.280
 actually what's offensive yeah it's just how i read it every time i look at it and it makes me laugh

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:52.600
 um schlappy engineering um i know everyone has the hundred grit yeah and so i was like you know what

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:58.360
 that one gets a lot of attention there's been plenty of reviews you know youtube videos of it

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:06.200
 it was like kind of kind of wanted to dig into the lesser known stuff um the angle grinder and the

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:14.680
 interstellar radio so i grabbed both of those um angle grinder was interesting so wait for our

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:18.760
 listeners who probably don't know it i mean like i think shawn holds the only person i can think of

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:28.120
 it had an angle grinder i think um dave does yeah oh really yeah okay so this maybe this probably

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:33.000
 requires a little bit of an explanation angle grinder i don't really know how to describe it it's

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:43.560
 like a quadr quadrature oscillator that you can also route audio through and it will function as a

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:52.600
 like strange wave shaper slash distortion slash filter depending on what mode you put it into

01:14:52.600 --> 01:15:00.040
 but not like frequency not like fm sort of yes okay it's all based on like the frequency knob and

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:06.840
 the difference like the four points where you have them you know i mean it's it's strange

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:12.920
 and i liked it it was an interesting approach you know i mean and like at the end of the day if

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.280
 you don't want to use it as like a distortion you can still use it as like pretty interesting

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:22.120
 filter or an oscillator or even lfo it has a mode that drop it into lfo mode um i haven't had

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:31.480
 like a quadrature lfo since intelligels um doctor doctor octa yeah doctor doc ock yeah um so it's

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:40.200
 been a minute and so i was having some fun with that but ultimately um after doing some recording

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:45.000
 with it i i kind of moved on from it quickly i i told it was what was missing about it like is

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:56.200
 nothing it was kind of great but it was big it took up a lot of space um and it seemed like

01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:00.120
 for processing which was my primary reason of getting it was you know distortion processing

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:07.000
 it was like a lot of finangling just to get to the same point every time it was like there was

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:13.000
 always like one spot where i'm like okay this sounds gnarly and good it's not too much not too

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:20.680
 less you know i mean it was like it that's a lot of module to kind of be like a one trick yes you

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:25.240
 were saying you know what i mean like just kind of like i was always kind of happy with like the

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:31.640
 one spot where i would get the wave shaping and then filtered you know and i'm like this is too

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:39.880
 much space just for that in my opinion uh so i moved on from it but if i had more rack space

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:47.480
 right now which is it's adult it's very tight right now um i would get one again for sure yeah yeah

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:53.880
 hundred percent um it makes me even more curious for the hundred grid now and i think i'm gonna

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:59.480
 have to try one out yeah because from the demos that i've heard it is slightly similar the hundred

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:05.480
 grid seems like it can be a bit more like off the rails squelching and resonance and feedback um

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:12.760
 which i forgot to mention like the the wave shaping if i recall correctly in the angle grinder is

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:20.280
 you know feedback based oh in some way yeah it's it's a strange beast that i didn't fully wrap my

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:26.440
 head around um i just had fun tweaking sliders and knobs and yeah getting nasty results out of it

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:32.040
 and having fun you know that that's his own reward yeah uh the inner seller would agree with me at all

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:38.440
 well no i was very like more uh whatever it is important like i don't like modules that aren't

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:45.320
 fun to use you know and it was for you know it felt like you're exploring new territory with angle

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.360
 grinder you know i couldn't really think of anything else comparative to compare it to except

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.880
 maybe when you run audio through like a piston Honda and you're trying all the different waves

01:17:53.880 --> 01:18:00.760
 and things like that um kind of remind me that but with less variety unfortunately um

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:07.800
 and the interstellar radio was cool what is that i've seen people using it and i've always been like

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:12.760
 i should look up what that is i can't ever bother i can't explain what the hell it is i can just

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:18.200
 explain like the type of sounds that's getting out of it um it basically sounds like you're

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:23.960
 screwing around with the like fm radio you know i mean it's not an actual radio which is why i

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:29.000
 didn't pay attention to it for a while i thought the module was actual like a radio receiver

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.680
 it's not it just like emulates those sounds as you're you know combing through the frequency bands

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:41.000
 and things like that um has like a carrier and a modulator and all that stuff um so i guess some

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.720
 sort of like mutant ring mod i guess aa slash like noise generator um it was pretty cool

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:55.080
 uh again uh i kept getting to like one point with it and being like yeah like how this sounds

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:59.880
 and everything else would just kind of like be too much could you send like like a like a um

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:03.640
 note sequence to could you basically play it like an oscillator could you sort of

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:09.080
 i didn't use it as an oscillator much i sure as hell never tried tracking with it like i just

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:12.600
 did it have that on it did it have like a one volt proactive tracking i mean it definitely has

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:19.640
 CV i don't remember if it was one volt proactive okay um i was like kind of moving quickly like i

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.320
 had a bunch of different distortions that i wanted to try these two were first on my list

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.160
 fair enough i felt like i put them through their paces gave them a shot uh i was liking

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:33.240
 intercellar radio more as like a noise source and to use not only with percussion but like as

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:38.360
 percussion yeah i was running it through low low pass gate things like that making little

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:46.680
 percussive hits with it metallic noise it was cool um but again not exactly what i was looking for

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:57.400
 or needed at that moment yeah so i progressed from there to british noise electronics grit filter

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:04.120
 it's good progression i've yeah it was okay so real quick big leap are all roads leading to british

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:10.920
 electronics i feel like you like like that's where you end up it is you take these paths you go you

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:16.440
 and then it's always it's like the um like the the television show where like there's like is an

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:21.240
 on and on again off again will they will they get together but like by the end of the season

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:28.280
 it's great in british electronics they fucking nail it for me yeah yeah it's every time i go back

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:35.240
 to it like i had the cast feta you know the cascading fat amplifier oh yeah yeah i had that twice

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:40.840
 you know like first i'ma had i was like this is great but it's you know it's just like you know

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:45.480
 an amplifier whatever i already got amplifiers i don't need this then i moved on other modules

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:50.200
 and then i was like no well i kind of did exactly what i wanted and it did it quickly so i got it back

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:57.560
 and i still have it now and now i have a grit filter to pair with it um and grit is yeah 100%

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:04.360
 what i was looking for yeah um it's not stereo not so you just said a hundred percent and then you

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:09.720
 immediately found a flaw always a flaw i wouldn't say it's a 99.5 oh it's on a flaw because i know

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:16.280
 you're really fired up for you yeah it's a feature because i know you're fired up for stereo like

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:21.240
 that's been like your thing for a long time yeah and i've just kind of given up on being able to

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:28.440
 do anything that i really love that is like distorted stereo field shit that isn't an oversteer

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:34.600
 modulate you know what i am not sure i've learned to compromise i say so it's 100% within

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:40.680
 this sort of compromised view yeah okay yeah and i overlooked the grit for a while because i was

01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:45.400
 like i don't need another filter you know i mean like i have tons of filters tons of dirty filters

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:50.520
 yeah um simple it's super simple which is another reason why i kind of overlooked it i was like

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:56.600
 yeah i was too so i almost got it too and i'm like i got filters i would say get one yeah yeah like

01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:02.200
 yeah i've always i think their stuff is beautiful too and uh i love the gun model panels it looks so

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:08.040
 good yeah the um the sound of it the distortion that you can achieve was it exactly what i was

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:15.080
 looking for it it goes to 11 so for for listeners and you give us an overview the filter but what

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:20.280
 other options is in it not much dude you have a toggle switch to switch between low pass high

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:29.240
 pass mode you have a limiter at the input uh which i am loving um oh cool i it doesn't give a whole

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:34.600
 lot of gain i think it's only like a plus 2.5 gain or something like that oh yeah but it's enough to

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:41.160
 make that limiter just give a little extra character you know what i mean yeah and it interacts with

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:46.280
 the the resonance just by pushing it that much further so you can get some really interesting

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.880
 you know harmonics out of the filter by just smashing that limiter a little bit

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:57.640
 um like that and then it has a grit button which has two different functions i think i can't

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:04.840
 remember exactly which i think one is like pre or post filter grit yeah i think so um and it's

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.880
 great but honestly like i can achieve distortion that i really like even without it like it's a nice

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:16.040
 extra oomph sometimes um is it like just in the high end where like what is the grit there it's

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:24.440
 definitely uh adding some sizzle to the top gosh i gotcha um and then it has a knob that is parallel

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:32.760
 i'm sorry it's parallel saturation or serial saturation yeah having a brainful yes yeah i don't

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:41.000
 know either way it's like a nice saturation knob um and it's just strange like it's hard to describe

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.280
 the characteristic of it it's almost like there's to the best of my knowledge there's no like

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:50.680
 delay circuit in there but at times it kind of feels like there is one like it's kind of like

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.800
 feeding back on itself and so starving almost not starving but just kind of like going into

01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:01.000
 itself in some way like a high settings it's adding like some interesting character maybe that's just

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:10.200
 the the resonance at the proper spots self-oscillating but yeah it's it's brutal it's unforgiving it's

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:17.880
 just three knobs into toggles basically yeah it exactly served the purpose that

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.840
 was looking and you posted a video on your instagram recently yes i did yeah sounded

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:28.840
 i i don't use this word lightly uh that's not a brutal thank you that was absolutely astounding

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:34.920
 yeah it's it's it's clicking with me like a lot of times with distortions i have a sound in my head

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:40.760
 and then i tried to replicate it and i struggled to do it because i can't find the right distortions

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:45.240
 you know yeah moment i install grit i was like that's that's it like that's what the fuck i was

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:50.120
 going for so you're so you're only going to sell it and rebuy it two more times i don't even think

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:56.040
 that would be possible really yeah it might be hard to get it that's yeah i was gonna say like if

01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:02.680
 you want a grit filter grab it now there's only two in existence right now that are for sale at a

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:10.440
 non insane price well signal sounds at the time this recording has two left okay um for 350 new price

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:17.960
 um on reverb you can get them for around 800 even though they're still available new yeah

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:24.280
 they're around 800 dollars on reverb i had some speculative pricing there yeah cascading fed up

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:31.240
 i thought yeah fed up cascading you said fed amplifier um i just love saying cast fed up it sounds

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:37.480
 like a delicious tune i would i would absolutely fuck that up yeah um cast fed up is going for the

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:45.960
 one of them was for 1900 oh oh my god but they dropped the price to 1600 so if you want to get it

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:52.120
 on sale now's the chance it's a bargain yeah no i think that costs 300 new 400 acts somewhere

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:57.800
 between three to four yeah and people are trying to flip them now for like four times five times

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:05.080
 the price cool the um i don't remember the name of the other module it's the only one that i don't

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:12.680
 have that i really wish i did but the first one yeah the first release gain stage ampel gain stage

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:18.600
 amplifier yes thank you those are going for like two grand as well yeah if they even pop up they

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:26.040
 i don't see any last i look i i don't know if they're done do yeah like so the website's been dead for

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:32.600
 about three months now oh um yeah and it's starting that's why the prices have been creeping out

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:37.560
 starting to become apparent that like maybe he's done yeah uh ansem hasn't made any official

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:43.880
 announcement um but yeah website's been dead there's been nothing new on instagram since the release

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:49.560
 of the cast fed up and so i think a lot of people are speculating that like the ones that are out

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:55.960
 there are all that's going to exist i hope that's not the case i hope i mean when i spoke to him

01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:01.000
 very briefly before the release of the cast fed up he said that like the cast fed up might not come

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.520
 out until 2023 yeah remember that yeah thankfully that didn't happen he managed to get some parts and

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:12.920
 made a few um but i don't know what the situation is now with the other modules like they might that

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:18.680
 might be it so that sucks because i knew he like basically quit music to like work on electronic

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:25.480
 stuff i'm like i hope he continues on i hope so too shit is killer yeah yeah i don't think there's a

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:30.840
 lot of people out there that need the filter to go to 11 but those that do need it you know like

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:39.640
 yeah it nails it so it's like yeah uh and he hits like right for uh new builder right out of the gate

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:45.320
 like pretty fucking strong showing yeah yeah absolutely kind of killer modules i mean just kind of

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:50.760
 spill over across all three you know what i mean but they all have enough differences that i would

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:55.720
 gladly have all three in my rig yeah is it just him doing it as far as i know so that's so that's

01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:01.320
 pretty impressive yeah i think he even hand builds them i could be wrong though yeah i think so because

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:06.280
 that one really interesting interview that he did when he talked about like switching to more

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:11.560
 electronic stuff less touring um and also was saying like he stopped using the a kind of force and

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:16.920
 was like switching over to the bit boxes for like live stuff and he was gonna work on a new live set

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:23.000
 that's the last thing i saw from him not that i've like exhaustively searched but i mean but

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.680
 everyone's everyone's suffering trying to make money touring it's yeah oh it's impossible so yeah

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:34.840
 my quest for a new distortion went full circle back to british noise engineering all pastly there

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:40.280
 or british noise electronics rather yeah i keep screwing up the name sorry sorry everyone and i did

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:47.640
 uh have a rediscovery of how much i love trash master hmm that black panel does look sweet it

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:54.200
 looks great i had two before that i upgraded the panels for um oh yeah oh my oh yeah but then i was

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:58.200
 like you know what i i've been you know just kind of like i got sick of it like i was using the trash

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:03.480
 master to death i had two of them i was like um you know this thing's great but i've recorded a lot

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:07.720
 of shit with it i don't need these anymore taking up space and i sold them now i have two in my rig

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:14.760
 again and now the wmd is you know yeah closing up shop i don't think i'll be getting rid of these

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:21.320
 ones again yeah i think i got two of them sitting right next to two muscle compressors oh nice yeah

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:28.920
 very nicely together very nicely so do you need us to like intervene if you ever think about

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:34.520
 selling one of these how do we stop this endless cycle uh the only way to stop it is to make the

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:38.920
 company go out of business because then i don't have the option to get them back later like yeah

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:42.920
 there's too many times where i've been comfortable selling stuff because i'm like well if i need it

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:50.040
 again i'll just get it again later yeah and like thanks to you know 2022 being 2022 that's not like

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:56.920
 an option anymore yeah i'm just learning to be like okay i'm i'm putting more thought into my purchases

01:29:56.920 --> 01:30:02.120
 and i'm trying to keep what i have and make sure that what i'm buying is something that i really

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:07.960
 need and want but you know that's why i won't sell my effects aid excel even though i have the

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:12.120
 4 hp and then the pro and i just use those two because i'm just worried like oh one of this is

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:18.280
 gonna break and like yeah you know it's based out of the ukraine too like because talk about uncertainty

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:23.320
 right right i mean i hope they keep cranking stuff out but obviously

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:30.440
 are you ready to talk about the trinity i am because it's sitting here it's it's it's in a um

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:35.080
 for a list i actually wanted to talk about that first and i got sidetracked by all the other stuff

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:40.360
 mmm that was been an exciting action-packed um episode so i'm looking at this in the way you've

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:46.120
 presented it i don't know if it was by accident or not it looks like a glamour shot like an unveiling

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:55.160
 kind of is dude i mean this this is the mod-bap trinity um i've had it since this afternoon

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:03.240
 and i spent my entire lunch break playing with it so there are for listeners there are

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:10.520
 somewhere around five thousand jacks yeah that is a good array of them there yeah and some uh

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:15.480
 toggles uh and uh very nice printing i really like the way the panel looks i know nothing else

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:21.720
 about this module this is a drum module three drum modules in fact all pressed into one

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:25.880
 oh wait is this the one you were talking about last episode yes sir and i said hopefully i'll

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:32.360
 have it by next episode and it arrived in the nick of time this afternoon so that worked out well but

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:37.880
 yeah this was the one i was hyped for it's i mean i haven't spent a whole lot of time with it obviously

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:43.480
 but the time that i did spend with it uh i was like immediately in love with it like this is is that

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:49.400
 a teensy on the back like it is okay yeah just so it's uh it's a pretty big module but on the back

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:55.640
 there's a daughter board looks like a teensy and a lot of uh a lot of SMD parts on the back yeah

01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:01.960
 yeah it's only got what that's six ten eleven knobs but tons of buttons and a hell of a

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:07.160
 lot of jacks three dip switches um it's it's basically the drum module i've always

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:16.440
 hoped would exist someday you know i mean like it's it's not samples it's drum synthesis um

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:24.520
 you can have each drum be whatever the hell you want that's nice it's not forcing you to do

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:29.960
 this is a bd this is snares hat yeah no it's if you want three kicks you got three kicks you want

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:33.080
 three different hats you got three different hats which is exciting because i know in the past

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:38.680
 we've talked about the fact that the three of us are not single bass drum music yeah all of us have

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:44.760
 a variety of them in the same song even in fact the sole purpose that i got this module for was

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:50.200
 pretty much to be a triple bass kick module yeah like i have other you know modules to handle

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:55.560
 percussive sounds and snares i could do them on here if i wanted but that wasn't the main appeal to me

01:32:55.560 --> 01:33:00.920
 uh this was mainly going to be like handling kick and bass duties which sound amazing

01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:07.720
 like it has some serious pitch range i was very impressed by it it can pound it has on board

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:14.120
 and this is all per drum mind you you hold shift and then you hit one two or three and that's the

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:21.080
 drum you're not editing oh that's really clever yeah so and you can stack them by the way what do

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:25.480
 you mean by stack so i don't play with that but yeah you can layer all three so you got some

01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:28.840
 magic the gathering cards there yeah give us some magic gathering cards it's pretty cool

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:35.720
 Trinity stack has three modes off where only one drum will be selected and play out on channel one

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:41.720
 other drums will play on their defined channels two and three two stack drums one and two will be

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:47.560
 selected to stack and play out together on channel one drum three will be on its own channel and

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:52.360
 then there's three stack one two and three will be selected to stack and play out together on channel

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:58.280
 one and by stack is that just mixed or how's it like what is stacking it's sort of the whole

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:04.680
 trigger and turn shape to spread the stack of voices oh that's so this is like you can make a

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:11.560
 triple layered kick yeah that you only need to you know manipulate once and gate once yeah um

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:16.040
 when the voices are stacked a single trigger receiving channel one will activate okay and all

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:23.560
 the stack voices that's fucking awesome yeah that's really cool now that stack mode that also has

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:31.960
 cycle mode here which has two different modes oh well three modes off on which is the blue mode

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:36.920
 which is random every time that drum receives a trigger it'll go through the four different

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:43.640
 drum modes at random so if you wanted like the analog simulation the FM the arcade noise you know

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:49.800
 that you're bouncing between them so you essentially do like a full drum set on a single channel and

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:55.320
 then the third mode is round robin same thing you know I mean so like per trigger it's going to

01:34:55.320 --> 01:35:00.680
 select the next mode over and over oh gosh i see what you're saying so it's not random it's

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:05.400
 cycling yes i was playing with that mode because that was the mode that i was least interested in

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:11.160
 and then on my lunch break i was getting some really cool rhythmic noise out of it so and the

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:17.080
 drum sounds themselves i i assume they've they've got beef they got beef you can add beef to it there's

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:22.520
 a clipper knob over here if you want to push things into like clipping distortion territory there's

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:28.440
 also a grit knob over here which is some sort of saturation i didn't read the manual see what

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:33.240
 it's emulating but it was it was nice it was beef and some stuff up that's for sure so you got these

01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:38.040
 knobs and you say you select the different modes but are the jacks dedicated to each of the different

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:44.680
 drums they are okay you got your three different lanes here so even though like you can only tweak

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:48.760
 a knob one at a time depending on the mode but you can see v all of it and it's going to do it in

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:56.200
 the background for that voice um which is awesome in my opinion love the design the design is solid

01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:01.480
 yeah originally i wanted two of these um i i don't even know if i would need to honestly it doesn't

01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:07.720
 like i can see getting a lot of mileage out of one right you know maybe down the road i can get a

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:14.760
 second one when i have more funds at my disposal but right now yeah i i i see myself doing a lot of

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:20.600
 recording with this yeah that's awesome um each drum also has like its own filter basically like

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:25.880
 it's the cue knob i i noticed to the right it's more of a high pass left more of a low pass center

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:32.920
 you're kind of like neutral um which is pretty cool too uh you have your sweep and time knobs

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:39.320
 that's for pitch modulation you have your hold and decay knob over here oh so it has its own envelope

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:44.120
 yeah i love that kind of mixing options on the output where you can do it like individual or

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:49.800
 send it to the mix or like that was super appealing to me as well because i love doing like different

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:55.320
 layered sub mixes yeah you can have each thing going out of its individual channel flip the switch

01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:03.000
 to have a go to the sub out or both so you can have like each drum voice processed individually on its

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.840
 own and also a sub mix coming out of the mix knob to some other processing you know right which is

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:14.760
 pretty nice that is uh that's awesome i didn't know until a couple weeks ago that mod bap stands for

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:21.400
 like modules that are good for boom bap and other like dance performance oriented stuff and that's

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:27.560
 kory banks focus with it and they're a black owned modular synthesis company yeah um that's

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:35.880
 not too common yeah pretty rad yeah it's awesome and the killing it on the design like i

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:41.160
 am way more interested now after hearing your explanation of this stuff it can do that's a

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:49.240
 powerhouse right there

01:37:49.240 --> 01:38:12.960
