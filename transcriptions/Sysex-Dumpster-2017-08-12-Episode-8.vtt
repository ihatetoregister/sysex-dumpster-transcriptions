00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [Music]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 [Music]

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Hey, are we live? Are we recording?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 In the cabin? In the woods? Yes.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Dolly Sods? We are in the woods.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 On a mountain.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Which mountain? Dolly Sods.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Forget which side.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 We're in a cabin with electricity.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 It's spooky.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 We have not yet found the Necronomicon.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 No, we follow record player with the Dave Matthews band, 12 inch.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 We played it backwards and we're pretty sure it's summoned to demon.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 I notice you gentlemen have some chilled beverages there.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 It's a fat tire. Yeah. No Belgium.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 I'm drinking a stolen cabin beer.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 This is a Rhine Geist Hustle Red Lager.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 You actually went for the stuff that was in the fridge?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Yeah, I tried one.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 It's a local.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 It's a local. We drove by a local brewery.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Since Cincinnati. That's not local.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 It's not bad. I don't even like Lager really.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 But Red Lager.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Yeah.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 It's doing me all right.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 It's free. It is free.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 The compliments of the ten.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 I'm not going to replace it. Sorry, man.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 I don't.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 So what are you drinking there, Greg?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 I have the pineapple strawberry Laquat.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Delicious. I sampled one earlier.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 I pronounced it properly this time.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Do we look up and that's the correct pronunciation?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 When you pronounce it right, you don't say anything.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 No words actually come out.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 You just pose and people know like, oh, it's Laquat.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Laquat.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Laquat.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 The mood is set. It's like a horror movie.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 It's like evil dead.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 It's a little chiller than evil dead.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 There's no tension yet.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Yeah.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 It's good lighting too. It's very good lighting.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 I did tuck tape of chainsaw to my hand, but...

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Fell off.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 You haven't tried the cucumber?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Fuck no.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Laquat.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 You should do a shot of it. We should all do a shot.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 I just fucking delicious.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 You like it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 I like cucumbers. You don't like cucumbers.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 I don't like cucumbers.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 You still like the drink, so that both well.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Or maybe it turns out I actually do like cucumbers.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 I just didn't know.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 No, you know.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Wow. This is quite a learning experience.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 This trip has opened your mind to many things.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 I don't know. There's so many good flavors of this shit.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 I feel like they're just making stuff up now.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 They didn't make up cucumbers.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 There's no way that those existed before the...

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 How often have you had a drink that contained cucumber?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Well, there's a Gatorade that has cucumber in it that apparently is really popular.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 That sounds like shit.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Orange Gatorade is good.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 This is reviews now about beverages.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Yeah.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 We do.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Our podcast is Beverage Reviews.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 ASMR for people that are thirsty.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 [laughter]

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 When they're sitting there licking their lips right now.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Do you have some?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 [laughter]

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 We don't want those out as needed.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Do you have to want it like a whip?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Like a...

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 You can make it more whip.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Yeah, make it.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 It sounds like a whip.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 It's not quite whip as shit.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 It whips for you.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 We're getting further away from a whip.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Nope.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Can the plunk?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 [squeaking]

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 [laughter]

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 It's some Paul Schreiber business there, isn't it?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Yep.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 [squeaking]

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 [laughter]

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 This is why we do this.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Oh my god.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 That's so horrible.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 [laughter]

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 That's why it's in my rig.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Yeah.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 It sounds like a robot Paul Schreiber.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 [laughter]

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Sorry Paul.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Much respect.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 [squeaking]

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 [laughter]

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 It's supposed to say fail, but it's failing.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 It sounds like it's just saying hello.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Like every time you do it.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 But just various states of like dying.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Is that how you use it?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Because you process that pretty heavily after.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Oh yeah.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Okay.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 I usually hit it with a lot of CB and use the like slow down glitch stuff.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Gotcha.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 I mean, to mutilate it.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 [squeaking]

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 That's...

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 It's supposed to get dinosaur fucking a robot.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 I know we've talked about this in the past, but does he know this is what you're doing to his creation?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 I doubt it.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 And speaking of Paul Schreiber.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 Oh, because he's going to be somewhere.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 He's going to be a knob cone.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 That was coming up.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Yeah.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 And he's going to be showing the new E3502 is it?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 52.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 You're right.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Yeah.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Because the 50 was the original morphing terrarium.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Yes.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 He's got the E52, which has a CV attenuator.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 There's a lot more control.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 The whole beautiful colored display.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Is it touch screen or no?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 I don't think it's touch screens.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 No.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 But it is a nice display.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 It's got the XY scope shit on which people love to do with his module.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Definitely step up than what's on my E951 expander.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 That's just like black and white tiny little ID.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 It's not this.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 It's a job done, but yeah.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 But this also doesn't really have a menu system.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Like the...

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Yeah.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 The 352 does.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 You know what I mean?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 So you actually need to be able to have a nice screen to navigate.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 It looks like he did a good job with that.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Yeah.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 It looks beautiful all around.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 And he's got that wave editor too, which people are pretty excited about just across the board to make waveforms for stuff.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Seems like a pretty nice program.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Yeah.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 I never had the 350, but I had the 344.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 I like that a lot.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 And this looks like a mutant of both of those combined, you know, to the 10th power along with a display to see what the hell you're doing.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Like you can make a cloud of E350 waveforms now.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 You know, I mean, not just the sine waves and the saw waves.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 It looks like a beast.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Yeah.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Looking forward to checking it out.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Because he's got the poly version too, which he's been cooking on for a while.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Yeah.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 The four voice one.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Not as exciting.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 To me is the fully patched out and all of that.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 352.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Yeah, I agree.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 The big one.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Yeah.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Was too big for me.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 My needs.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 I don't really need poly.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 And it's an expensive and large module.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 I mean, it looks awesome.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 It's just not something that I felt like I ever needed.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 352.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 I can definitely see you getting one of those.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 In black.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Yeah, that's the thing.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 Because I think if you want it in black, you got to get it now.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Yeah.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 It's like, oh, that's a trick.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 That's a dirty trick.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 I need a good one.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 If he has any for sale at NovCon, I might be going home with one.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Yeah, maybe.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 We'll see.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 I've been tempted by it.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 I want the in-person demo that we've been getting from Paul every year at NovCon.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 With every new thing that he has.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 He always does a hell of a job explaining it while making me feel completely inadequate.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 As a human being.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And I always go home and buy what he showed me.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Yeah.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Yeah.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.600
 Doing it, he's kind of like as people are freaking out about the status of it, he's kind of

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.600
 like, yeah, whatever.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.000
 I know what I'm doing and I'm making progress and here it is.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.240
 It's kind of cool to see a lot of the haters being just shut down by Paul being pretty

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.960
 damn consistent with what he's doing.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.040
 He comes out of nowhere with these things and it's just like there's nothing else like

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.360
 that on the market.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.120
 And all of a sudden, all these people pop up on Muffwiggler and they're trying to tell

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.000
 him what he needs to be doing with this module.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.080
 And I was like, what are you comparing this to?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.440
 There's nothing else that exists.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.240
 Like this is, he's the one inventing this shit.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.840
 Just let him do his thing.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.840
 Like, yeah.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.680
 So speaking of NovCon.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.680
 Yes.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.240
 The list of people presenting or whatever, the list came out yesterday.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.480
 Oh, was there any surprises?

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.480
 There was a few.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.640
 Wait, are we on the list?

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.640
 We are.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.640
 Because we have a table.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.640
 We're presenting.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.240
 Shit right down there, Sisek Stomster.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.240
 Wow.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.240
 We're fucking famous.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.760
 We have nothing.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.760
 Noise engineering is listed as presenting, which to my knowledge, he's never done before.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.760
 No.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.440
 We've always just played with the noise engineering stuff and other people's racks there.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.440
 Yeah.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.440
 I think usually along with--

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.120
 I thought it was one of the places that was selling stuff.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.120
 Fox to them.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.120
 Yeah, that was--

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.120
 Okay.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.120
 Yeah.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.120
 So, engineering's on there.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.120
 That's the first to my knowledge.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.120
 That'd be cool.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.000
 Industrial music electronics will be back.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.240
 New jams that he's bringing.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.000
 He's got at least three that he's been kind of teasing, right?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.160
 Oh, three modules?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.400
 Argos, Bleak, and a few others.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.400
 Argos, Bleak.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.400
 What does that actually do?

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.400
 No fucking clue.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.400
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.400
 Okay.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.400
 The videos that he's posted, it sounds cool.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.760
 I finally get to check it out, I guess, in person.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.760
 Moog, Moog.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.240
 They've been in there in the past, though, haven't they?

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.240
 Yeah.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.960
 They've been in that whole corner.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.960
 Yeah.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.960
 And the hotel that one year?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.960
 Yeah, I forget.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.560
 I mean, we didn't go pay attention.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.000
 It was on the second floor, like at the top of the stairs.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.440
 It was the second to last hotel.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.080
 I thought usually just people brought--

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.080
 No moog, though.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.080
 --stuff in.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.080
 They got like signs and shit.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.240
 Yeah, they were there, show us how much I pay attention.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.640
 Like that's-- I mean, there were a lot of people there and they were fired up for it.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.840
 Yeah, because they had all those, like, they had everything that they make, like all those

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.840
 sub-37.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.640
 Sub-37 looks rad.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.560
 It's just not something I'm giving.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.560
 Bye.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.560
 It's like a TV out.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.360
 It looks really-- like it integrates very well with a modular, which it should.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.360
 Yeah.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360
 Yeah.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.120
 We got an electron.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.280
 Maybe shilling off their Mark II previews?

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.920
 I don't even want to see the Mark II.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.480
 It's just-- I'm going to want it.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.480
 I know I want it.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.480
 Yeah.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480
 It's like already a done deal.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.600
 I honestly want to check out Heat in person.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.600
 Oh, yeah?

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.600
 I'm curious.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.600
 Curious.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.560
 What do you think-- where do you think the surprise is going to be?

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.760
 It's either going to sound better than I imagine or sound exactly as I imagine.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.760
 Oh.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.400
 It'd be good to find out.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.400
 Yeah.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.320
 I mean, just the reason why I haven't gotten one yet, because I just don't see how it's

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.760
 going to stand out over any other, like, distortion pedal out there that costs half the price

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.000
 or an old analog mixer that costs, like, one-eighth the price.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Yeah.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 You know what I mean?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 I don't know.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.960
 I know, Serchai used it quite a bit, it seems.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.540
 Yeah, he-- I see him using it in some Instagram videos, but at the same time, he's

00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.400
 also running that same sound source through, like, multiple other distortion paths before

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.400
 it hits the electric--

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.400
 Like, electric mechanical.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.400
 Right.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.680
 And he's always slamming everything with that L1 stereo compressor, and I know that thing

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.680
 sounds amazing, so--

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.680
 Right.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:16.800
 It's hard to tell how much of that nice sounding compressed distortion is coming from Heat

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.560
 or from other sources, you know?

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.120
 It's basically what I want to find out, is how brutal can this thing get?

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.180
 And it'd be as brutal as a-- or more brutal than, like, an old fucking Mackie mixer,

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.180
 you know what I mean?

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.180
 Yeah.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:34.580
 If you can reach that level of nastiness and still keep the noise floor low, then I'm

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.300
 interested, you know what I mean?

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.660
 But if, otherwise, if it sounds like the same, then why bother?

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.660
 Right.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.420
 You can get an old mixer for fucking $75.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.420
 Yeah.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.420
 What's 700?

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.860
 What's the, um, the white version of it that's like--

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.860
 It's--

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.860
 Drive, is that it?

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.860
 Like, just called Drive or something?

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.860
 Yeah.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:58.360
 Because I see a-- it's like a guitar magazine, and guitar people seem to, like, it gets,

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.360
 like, huge, awesome ratings.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.140
 But that doesn't mean much for us, you know?

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.800
 The main difference with that thing is you have no presets saving, you have no envelope

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.560
 follower and no stereo out.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.160
 No over-bridge, no US.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.160
 Right.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.160
 It's just like straight forward.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160
 It's just straight pedal.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160
 It's just a pedal.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.160
 Yeah.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.160
 Yeah.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.280
 Which is kind of more appealing to me, you know?

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.280
 Yeah.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.600
 It's a little smaller, less expensive, and it's just doing what it's supposed to be doing

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.560
 as distorting shit, which is all I would be using it for.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.660
 I hope they have a rhythm sitting there to hook up into a heat, because then we'll be

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.660
 able to--

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.660
 Right.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.660
 --know what that sounds like.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.660
 That's basically what I want to do.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.660
 Or a machine drum, you know?

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.660
 Right.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:35.660
 Or just drag your--

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.660
 Drag your--

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.660
 Drag your--

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.660
 Drag your rig over there.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.660
 Yeah.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.660
 And just sit it down, go.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.660
 Just plug it in.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.660
 Listen.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.660
 There's a good chance I'm going to walk away with this.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.220
 Let me plug this in and see what it does.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.220
 Take it for a test drive.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.220
 Yeah.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.220
 I was going to bring my video shit.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.220
 To the--

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.220
 Oh, you fucking--

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.220
 Oh, you fucking should.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.220
 That's a good idea.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.220
 It's really--

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.220
 How would you present it?

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.440
 Would you bring the Commodore monitor?

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.440
 Mm-hmm.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440
 Sweet.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.440
 Yeah.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.440
 It's a great idea.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.440
 If we have space for it, I think we do.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.440
 I crossed my mind.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.440
 But that's cool.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.240
 Probably have to seat-belt it in, except that thing's old and heavy.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240
 Right.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.280
 But yeah, I'm sure you're going to do that.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:18.360
 We'll deal down one of the TVs from our hotel room.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.760
 Zeta-Omes on there?

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.660
 Get the play of a working, Fluctious one this time?

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.660
 Yeah.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.660
 Not just look at the prototype.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.460
 Will you guys have them by then?

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.900
 It doesn't look like it.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.900
 No, no.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.900
 I think they're going to be shipping out.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.900
 I think late August now.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.300
 Oh, even-- I think it's like more September October.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.300
 Yeah.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.900
 I'm still-- I'm wildly looking forward to that.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.900
 Yeah.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:39.900
 Yeah.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.140
 Super excited to maybe use this or replacement for some of the variegating voltage block

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.980
 for a live situation.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.740
 I'm very excited for you guys to get them, so that I can play with them.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.940
 It seems like an amazing machine.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.740
 Yeah.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.960
 I think he's in releaseable format, like pretty much at any point.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:00.400
 I know he's just-- he added like swing per channel, a few other things that he said he

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.720
 wanted to add, but it wasn't thinking they were going to be in the initial release.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.240
 But now he just has more time.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.160
 Is WMD going to be there?

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.160
 Not on the list?

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.160
 That's a bummer.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.760
 They usually are the ones who demo some other stuff from other people.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.760
 They're just sick of people asking about the Geiger.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.960
 Not the Geiger, the--

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.960
 Game of Wave.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.960
 Game of Wave.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.900
 It was his proof that the Omni Mods exist where he also had a picture of, here's the Geiger

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.180
 Counter Pro pedal that nobody's seen until now.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.980
 Keep in mind that this is not the finalized list.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.020
 Oh, well, hopefully they jump on that.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.020
 Yeah.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.820
 I think they've been there every year we've been there.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.820
 Yeah.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.740
 There isn't too much like the-- too much more that I can think of it in the op-con that

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.820
 I'm really looking forward to see that I know right now.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.820
 It was engineering.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.980
 It was engineering-- yeah, the percido or--

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.980
 Yeah.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:52.400
 I don't think that seems-- I want to put some time in with that.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.240
 I might not actually be able to fit it.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.960
 I don't know, because I got the 4MS Sampler combo.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.960
 Oh, that's-- yeah, that's pretty bad.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.120
 --is pretty shit about next week, I think.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.120
 And it's pretty big.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.160
 So I'm going to have to rearrange some shit.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.640
 So I'm curious, what do you want to do with the 4 milliseconds one?

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:12.920
 Aside from just general carnage and stuff, are you thinking drum duties, both everything?

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.920
 Both.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:21.300
 I already have a couple ideas to make full banks of drum hits, but on the other hand,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.460
 I want to dedicate several banks through just live looping.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:31.500
 I was reading the manual, you can have each sound immediately loop when it ends.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.580
 I forget what it is, but you hold down two buttons and that'll either go from one shot

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.580
 to loop mode.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:41.740
 So you can toggle between the two, but also every sample, there's a dedicated end out,

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.740
 or a jack.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.340
 So when the sound clip ends, it'll generate a gate.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.640
 So essentially, you can have it generate the start every time it ends.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:57.740
 So you could like fuck with the start and end times and every time it ends, trigger

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.740
 itself over and over.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:02.660
 And so you could do some really weird granular type stuff.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.020
 Does it also have like gate play?

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.580
 Like you send it to gate.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.580
 You don't want to play that long.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.580
 I don't know.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.580
 That's a good question.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.580
 Good question.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:15.100
 So if you have it in loop mode, you could have it playing in a loop only as long as it's

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.100
 receiving a gate.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.100
 Yeah, I get what you're saying.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.100
 That would be cool.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.660
 No idea if it could do that.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.660
 Yeah, I'm excited for it mainly because I don't know.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:29.540
 I bounce out a lot of the stuff that I make in the modular as chunks, and then I drop

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:35.500
 them into slicers and loopers and shit in my DAW, but it'd be nice to not have to balance

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:42.540
 it out and be able to manipulate chunks of my audio within the modular realm in real

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.540
 time.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.580
 I'd like to be able to use that for performance also.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.900
 I already have some ideas.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:53.300
 Are you imagining actually recording yourself using it like a loop or pedal type of thing?

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.300
 Not a cool idea.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.460
 Like starting from a blank slate.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.300
 Yep, record, add new stuff to it.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.300
 Exactly.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.460
 That's a cool idea too because then like starting to click now when you're talking about like

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.380
 now you can use those modules for something else.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.780
 So you can repatch on the fly and go, okay.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.740
 You don't even have to take that far.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.540
 You don't have to necessarily repatch it, but if you have, you can just all of a sudden

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.540
 change the parameters.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.540
 Yeah.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.500
 And you'll still have this sound here and now you can either layer it with that or bounce

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.500
 out a new chunk.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.500
 I don't know.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.100
 I have some ideas whether or not I'll actually be able to apply these ideas.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.100
 Not a cool idea though.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.940
 It's just me patching it in my head.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.580
 That's what people do with the Octatrack a lot.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.820
 We're talking about the last episodes that looper thing that's kind of elusive.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.820
 That sounds like it might be a quicker path that's like less of an Octatrack to get there.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.820
 It should be rad.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.820
 Yeah.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.500
 No time stretching or anything like that.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.060
 Like you would get in an Octo, but yeah, it's still similar in that way.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:52.180
 I do hope someone eventually, if not with the 4MS and some other easy looper will have

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.460
 like time stretching and they will be very nice.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.380
 I'm trying to think of what can do that in a module right now.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.460
 I don't even know if the 301 can do it.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.140
 I think it was mentioned like it'll be added at some point in the 301.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.780
 I don't know if it's there currently, but yeah, because the hack right now is you take

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.780
 the saw wave or saw wave into it and then just kind of have it move the start point

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.660
 and then have it kind of shift through it and people are doing like.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.860
 We do time stretching that actually sounds like.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.460
 Yeah, that's what I used to do on the time so far.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.460
 Exactly.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.460
 You got to patch it.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.460
 Yeah, it's not just like offline.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.460
 Right.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.460
 Real time.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:29.940
 That's no fun because you want to be able to see the end points and the start points

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.940
 while having something time stretch.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:32.940
 You know what I mean?

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.940
 That's where the good good is.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.940
 Yeah.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.060
 That's where you start getting into some crazy fuckshed up manipulation.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.220
 We're just not close enough yet to battery in a module.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.220
 No.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.700
 Keep waiting for it.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.740
 This is there actually, he's working on the drum rack portion of this of the 301 which

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.500
 seems like it'll be like battery esc, but still no time stretch.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.500
 Roland.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.980
 Alot of the boutique.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.980
 The boutique.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:58.980
 Boutique.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.980
 Are we saying that correct?

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:01.980
 Yeah.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:02.980
 Boutique.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:03.980
 Boutique.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.980
 Boutique.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:11.900
 So they got the TR08 which is the 808 clone which is kind of inevitable given that they

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.900
 did the 909.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.660
 They got the 101 in the different colors.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.660
 The 101.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.700
 I'd like to give that a shot maybe.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.980
 The boutique things they already like in my mind make me want to go left.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.140
 You know, it's like, oh, everybody's going to get these.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.140
 Don't do that.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.140
 Do something else.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.140
 Yeah.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.140
 I'm not peeling with them.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.820
 We're going to hear that sound a lot.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.580
 Well, look coming up here soon.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:37.660
 Again, just like we talked about last year around this time when they debuted the 909

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.660
 and shit.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:43.020
 It's like why bring it back if you're not really offering anything new with it.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.340
 I mean, I know it has a few new tricks up its sleeve, but it's still like what?

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.340
 20 years?

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.340
 At least 30?

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.340
 Oh, dude.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.340
 Yeah.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.660
 808 was 1980 and 909 was 1983.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.260
 And in 30 years you can't come up with anything more than just say like, oh, it can do Pauli

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.260
 now and shit.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.260
 It's like, come on.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.540
 It's like, why just make something to be a throwback?

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.540
 Because it is.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.540
 They know people.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.540
 Yeah.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.540
 People want that.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.060
 I mean, we talked about this exact thing last year and in the same vision.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.060
 In the same vision.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.220
 I read this review of it.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.460
 I'll say, you know, they're powered off like USB plugs.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.300
 The guys main complaint was if you power it off a USB, there's like an inevitable 60

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.740
 cycle hum that comes into it that you can only fix by powering with batteries.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.660
 And they last like an hour and a half or two hours on the batteries or something like

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.660
 that.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.540
 And this dude is talking about, yeah, when I take it to the club, it sounds amazing,

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:36.780
 but I have to put batteries in right before I play it to get out of the 16th like hurts.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:37.940
 Get the fuck out of here.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:38.940
 Yeah.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.940
 That's what that's what his review.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.820
 Otherwise he's like, oh, it sounds great.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:46.540
 Like it sounds like better than the TRA does, but there's like, why did they power it that

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.540
 way?

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.540
 So they don't have another power option.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.540
 It's only USB or battery.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.540
 Yeah.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.540
 It's like a little USB.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.540
 Like a wallward.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.100
 I don't think so.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.100
 That's just stupid.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.100
 Yeah, I read that.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.100
 It was like, oh, never.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.100
 I don't get it.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.100
 They're cute.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.300
 Even Derek basically was like, all these things are fucking cute.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.300
 Yeah, they're adorable.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.460
 But at that point, you're just selling nostalgia and aesthetic.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.020
 They're doubling down on the cute too, because they've got that little, do you see the little

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.180
 keyboard you can get?

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.180
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.180
 Yeah.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.100
 Everything about it is just like, I've got a nephew who's in the music.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.660
 I'm going to get him this cute little keyboard.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.500
 I mean, it's that level of adorableness.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.860
 I'm sure you can buy them this Christmas.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.860
 What's the fucking stuff?

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.860
 Got a guitar center.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.660
 Not guitar center that plays themselves hipster record player.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.180
 Oh, I'm a urban author.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.180
 Thank you.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.180
 Oh, I guarantee you.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.180
 Oh, god.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.180
 You know what I mean?

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.820
 It's going to be sitting right next to your fucking mustache toaster and all this other

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.220
 cheese ball shit.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.220
 It's like, come on.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.060
 We're talking about a fucking legendary machine here.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.060
 Yeah.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.060
 You know what I mean?

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.060
 It reduced the novelty.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.060
 Yeah.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.060
 Exactly.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.540
 It reduced to something you can get a fucking Spencer's gift.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.780
 It's like, fuck's sake.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.780
 Come on.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.260
 I'm not going to attack it at this angle, but it's like, why can't you just do what worked

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.260
 first time?

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.180
 And just call it fucking done.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.180
 Yeah.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.220
 Because people were, that was the one, the review where the guy said it had the homo.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.820
 He also mentioned like, in the original, the knob spanned the width of everything on

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.820
 the machine.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.620
 If they would have moved it even like a few centimeters over, this thing wouldn't be painful

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.260
 to like, he's like, he even said, like, I guarantee if you use it live, you're going

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.420
 to fuck up these knobs.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:18.420
 Like, I have when you're doing a sweep, like on something in the middle of a sack.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.420
 Go to town on the knobs.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.420
 Yeah.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.420
 You can't tweak it out.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.420
 You're going to fuck them up.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.900
 Like, how do you not take your own legacy serious?

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.420
 They fucked it up to about in the 90s and it's like, oh, you're going to recover.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.420
 No.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.420
 There you are.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.180
 The TR8 was such a promising start.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.180
 Yeah.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.180
 You still have one, right?

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.180
 Yeah.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.180
 Yeah.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.180
 It's a great little machine.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.660
 It's lacking many things.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.540
 But it's fun to tweak out on.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.540
 Yeah.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.540
 Interface is nice.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.740
 It's not a stable sequencer shit, but it's whatever.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.900
 You can jump your patterns on it and shit and hook up a MIDI controller to it and make

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.540
 up for that, I guess.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.100
 I mean, that's how I've gotten by.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.540
 I always felt like that was the start, not like, oh, this is it.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.540
 Right, right.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.540
 You know what I mean?

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.540
 Yeah.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.700
 Like, I was like, okay, this is a good start.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.380
 I can't wait to see what they do next while paying respects to the older devices.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.100
 And this is what they come up with.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.580
 It's like, come on.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.580
 It's Japan too.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:21.620
 It's like they have a limited space so they want to sell devices that people in Japan

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:27.100
 can have all of them in a reasonable amount of space without having our, you know, we

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.140
 have huge houses compared to them.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.660
 So it's part cultural.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.660
 It's part that they, you know, miniaturization has always been.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.380
 What is it, the super-deformed, dusty versions of things?

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.940
 I've always, that's like cultural phenomenon.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.940
 So they kind of made like the SD version of like the big boys.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.780
 And it's kind of like, just take it that extra step.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:50.060
 And this thing, Barringer immediately put up their picture of their one-on-one clone,

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.820
 which has full-size guitar.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.420
 I haven't looked at that yet.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.220
 It's like M101 or something like that.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.220
 Yeah.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.860
 And it looks like, it's a kind of crappy picture of someone holding a keytar, but it looks

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:01.860
 like it's-

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.780
 That's what a one-on-one should be though.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.660
 Yeah, like, I had the keytar attachments for mine.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:12.420
 Never once used it like a keytar, but I was just excited to have that, you know, attachment

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.420
 and the original strap and everything.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.420
 It was like, you know.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.500
 So you felt like they got the drawing on the side of the box.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.500
 Yeah.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.500
 Yeah.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.500
 That thing was, oh, it was mint too.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.900
 I mean, that's the only one-on-one I've really spent time with.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.900
 And that's the one that was-

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.660
 It was mint, except for the fact some jag-off left the fucking batteries in.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.420
 And then it melted the inside.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.860
 And that's sure we can look forward to people doing the same thing with these ones now.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.420
 If you have to put fucking batteries in, just to not get a hum.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.580
 But yeah, one-on-one, man, it's a hell of a machine.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.260
 Yeah, it bums me out that they're doing it.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.260
 Doing it dirty, man.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.260
 Yeah.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.540
 I don't know if the one-on-one is this dirty.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.300
 Like I'm fine with the one-on-one.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.300
 Yeah.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.300
 Yeah, it's the 808 and the other ones.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.060
 Like the one-on-one looks usable.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.540
 They even made the sliders bigger because that's the Jupiter 8 version.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.100
 The sliders, it's like, centimeter of slider travel.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.100
 Oh, wait, seriously.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.100
 For real.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.100
 For real.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.940
 Have you ever- I've played with one at pianos and stuff.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.980
 I'm just like, oh, fuck, this is not usable.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:13.140
 The Juno had fuller sliders, but they really had to jam it in for the Jupiter one.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.740
 And it's like, ah, but even the Create Digital Music Review of the one-on-one, it's like,

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.340
 oh, they extended the slider, so it's like full range.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.940
 They did a nice paint job.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.660
 It's not wobbly like the other ones.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.020
 So they're iterating on that concept.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.220
 The one-on-one looks interesting to me.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.900
 I would have to play with it, dude.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.420
 I'd have to hear it.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.420
 And I'd just have to play it.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.820
 You know, that was the thing with the one-on-one is that the interface was perfect.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.820
 Right.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.820
 I love the fucking slider.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.820
 I like sliders in general.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:39.820
 You know what I mean?

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.060
 And the one-on-one sliders, I felt great.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.260
 You could find the sweet spots.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.900
 It was all sweet spots.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:46.900
 You know?

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:47.900
 Exactly.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.620
 And I felt like I could dial in the ones that I wanted with my fucking eyes closed.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.580
 You knew where it was on that slider.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.580
 You know what I mean?

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.580
 You filled out real quick.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.820
 It was like pounding on a multi-bandy cue.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.820
 You know what I mean?

00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.820
 You just know where the fuck you're going.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.260
 You don't even have to hear it yet.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.060
 You just know what you dial and end type of thing.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.860
 I don't know how you're going to be able to do that on a tiny little thing like that.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.540
 I feel like you're going to be overshooting your sweet spots.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.540
 You know what I mean?

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.580
 Trying to dial in these little fucking sliders and stuff.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.420
 That's what the Jupiter 8 one that was like, "Oh, you can't even."

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.180
 This is not usable to me.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.500
 And that's when people were like, "Oh, you can use it with an external CC's or something."

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.500
 But they're like, "Exactly.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.500
 You defeated the purpose."

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.500
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.500
 I wouldn't do anything.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.500
 Yup.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.500
 Make it the size of a fucking calculator.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.820
 I'll cut up a fucking MIDI box through it.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.500
 You have it just be a sound brain at that point.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.500
 Yeah.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.500
 Who can up a MIDI control?

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.500
 You've admitted defeat at that point.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.380
 Like that it doesn't work for you.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.420
 The 909's been out for like a year.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.420
 Has it sold well?

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:46.340
 I don't think I've seen a lot of live setups that included it.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.660
 When it was released, no one shut the fuck up about it.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.660
 Right.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.660
 There was so much chatter about it.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.060
 And now, yeah, I don't really see much happening with some of my own.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.740
 I don't know anyone that owns one.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.740
 Techno dude Paul Birkin.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.660
 But even then, I think he changed all the knobs on it.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:05.180
 Then I had to have smaller knob caps so we could actually use the freaking thing live.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.540
 Now, it looks like he has a digit act instead of that.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.100
 There's also the hidden SP404 update, non-update.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.820
 So they released an SP404A alongside all of this stuff, which has the IRR colors.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.820
 And they sell it.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:27.740
 There's also a TR8 update so that you can trigger the SP404 from the TR8.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:32.020
 Except like they kind of sell it as though it's something you can do that already with

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.700
 the existing SP404.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.020
 All they've done is put the new colors on it.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.020
 And they added a TR8 update so you can trigger it just like anything else could trigger via

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.020
 MIDI.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:45.260
 So they've repainted the 404, added no features to it at all.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.220
 And they're selling it as the IRR version of it.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.820
 They make it seem like it can only do this shit with the TR8 or as anything.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.580
 Well, you need to match your other IRR products.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.300
 It seems like an odd split within the company.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.700
 These halfway there cute ones that look like the real thing versus you're like, you couldn't

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.700
 make these fucking uglier.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:07.500
 IRR versions of things where it's like really the matrix aesthetic is really like they're

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.860
 locked into it.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:09.860
 Green and black.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.860
 Yeah.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.860
 I can't deny.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:12.860
 I kind of like it.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:13.860
 Oh, you do?

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:14.860
 I like it.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.020
 It makes me like nostalgic for the 90s, dude.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.500
 I like dude.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.220
 If I was like a 13 year old and I walked into the Guzzar Center in like, you know, 1995

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:28.100
 or whatever and I saw a TR8 sitner glowing green and black dude out of piss my pants

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.100
 for that.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.100
 I know that.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.860
 I'll admit to that too.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:36.180
 For me, they could have tapped into the modder's market where it would just make me sell me

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.460
 something where I could make the trim black or like make it any color.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.260
 I do wish I could modify it.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.260
 Yes.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.380
 Yeah, they could have made a ton of money to sell it.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.300
 Like I've never seen the 808 mod for the TR.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.300
 Yeah, that looks nice.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.500
 I can't deny that.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.500
 But the default skins and shit to I kind of dig.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.220
 I don't know why.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:59.220
 It's not like the original 808 was I candy to begin with.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.820
 Oh, to me, that's like, yeah, like the originals, especially the 909 and the 808.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.740
 It's like that to me, that shit is like from that's alien shit.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.420
 Like really truly like, I don't know how you made that.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:17.860
 And that's that one engineer, same engineer that made like 303 808, 909.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.660
 That dude's on another planet.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.380
 That was a static.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.580
 808 always looked like an 8 track player to me.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.580
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.580
 Yeah.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.060
 The look of it has never appealed to me.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.620
 The 909 I always kind of looked like because it just looks like something from a sci-fi

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.620
 movie.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.620
 Yeah.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.620
 Yeah.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.620
 Yeah.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.620
 To me, they're like pure, just so 80s.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.620
 Like it's like, aw.

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.620
 It's like a little shadow run to me.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.620
 Like it's that whole thing of like that's your deck.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.340
 But yeah, that being said, the backlit sliders that's brilliant.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:44.340
 Yeah.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:49.060
 Like for using it live or having it in a studio like they, the UI enhancements that they

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.220
 put into that and the knob spacing, it's like so usable.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.620
 It's like, why is it?

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:58.020
 You got to kind of get together and like make like seriously, don't you see that gap?

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.900
 There's a middle ground between those two.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:00.900
 Yeah.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.300
 The TRA, yeah, it'll take up a chunk of dust space.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.300
 But it should.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.660
 Sliders for every voice well spaced.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.340
 You know, everything just jives.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.660
 It's a nice interface all around.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.740
 Yeah, I wish the, like I was hoping, like you said, like that seems like a good start.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:19.540
 Like take that interface and keep like, they kind of did shoehorn some other models into

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.540
 it, I guess.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.660
 The 606, 70, 77, 77 stuff.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.460
 There's something, yeah, Mr. D kind of like, that's almost like the other end where it's

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.620
 like, oh, this is patched out.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.580
 This is like analog, like there's like an interesting middle ground in there.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:38.780
 Like Roland could take that further, like individual outs that aren't kind of crazy to

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.740
 assign and figure trigger inputs.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.740
 Absolutely.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.300
 I would love trigger inputs and trigger outputs.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.300
 Yeah.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.300
 What's actually on the back?

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.100
 Like what are the ins and outs on that?

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.100
 On the TRA?

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.100
 Yeah.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.260
 You got two like AB outputs.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.260
 Yeah.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.420
 And then you got your main stereo out.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.140
 You can, if I recall, right?

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.780
 You can assign the voices to the other AB out.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.860
 So you can't figure it to be like, rimshot always come out of this one.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:09.100
 You can, but the thing that annoys me with it is you can't do it live.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.900
 You have to restart the machine.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.900
 Yeah.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.900
 Holy shit.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.060
 To do a dedicated output on any voice.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.620
 Because that would be really cool to be able to just do that on the fly.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.620
 Yeah.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.620
 Yeah.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.420
 Which 8.9 and 9, it's like everything's there.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.740
 You know, meant to hook up to a mixer live.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.940
 I find it really hard to have that turn the machine off.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.860
 Hold the key code.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.700
 Sequence booted up.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:34.420
 Tell it which channel you want or which track I should say to go out which channel A or

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.420
 B or main.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:39.020
 I've never even used it because I'm like, oh, I just used the stereo out.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.540
 I have just to route things through different distortions into that nature.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.420
 But like every time I do it, I'm like, well, fuck now I want this channel to go through

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.380
 there too and this net and like you have to turn it off and go through the processing

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.740
 and it's just not very speedy process.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.300
 It's kind of cumbersome.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.500
 Do you feel like there was like wasted real estate back there that they could have had

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.300
 more trigger and trigger out all the stuff you room?

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.620
 There's some space.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.140
 They probably didn't want to.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.140
 It was probably diminishing returns from a product development standpoint.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.540
 They're like, 90% of people are just going to bang stuff out of the stereo out.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.380
 So we're not going to put in the effort to add all these other jacks.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.380
 But.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.380
 TB3, I still have.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.380
 You don't have the.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.380
 Not anymore.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.620
 Yeah, that's good for as a baseline machine.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.980
 It's got some secrets in it too.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.460
 It's all about the alternate waveforms.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.460
 Yeah.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.460
 Yeah.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:34.900
 I don't even know if those were implemented yet when I had one.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:35.900
 I can't remember.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.820
 It was a very, very early version of the OS.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.860
 Just like the TR8 when I first had it.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.540
 Didn't have any of those other things.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.460
 It just had the 908 and 808.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:44.460
 That was it.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:48.660
 And then when I found out they released all this other stuff a year or so later, I bought

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.660
 it again.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:55.140
 They're like 100 waveforms and you have to know where the square and the saw are.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.660
 Otherwise you're at their super saws.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:05.620
 There are all sorts of other emulations in a different way.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.420
 So the stars at night are big and bright.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.420
 Where?

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.420
 Deep in the heart of West Virginia.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.460
 You see what I did there?

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.460
 Yeah.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.180
 I switched it around.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.180
 So plonk.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.180
 Oh yeah.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.180
 Yeah.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.180
 Got a plonk.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.180
 Yeah.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.180
 We were hearing some demos of it earlier.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.420
 It sounded great.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.740
 Do you think so Dave?

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.740
 I don't know.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.740
 Now you're making me second guess it.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.740
 Think about it.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.260
 No, I'm pretty happy with the sound of it overall.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.260
 Yeah.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.940
 I think it's too early to say if I feel like it sounds great just yet though.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.940
 Can you make it great?

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.140
 Sell me on that end up being great.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:47.860
 It has a lot of different models and a lot of different presets but I feel like a lot

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:53.140
 of sounds out of it overall sound the same tonally.

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:58.140
 I feel like almost everything I've only messed with it for like four days now but I feel

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:02.460
 like the majority of I get out of it all sounds like different variations of the same

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.900
 preset.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.420
 Even though it's not.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:10.940
 Even if I completely wipe everything out, initiate preset and start from scratch.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.620
 I feel like a lot of things that come out of it sound like plonk.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.620
 You know what I mean?

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.340
 Not that it's a bad thing.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.980
 It's just that I thought I would get a little more variety of different sounding things out

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:22.980
 of it.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.340
 It's really funny you say that though because I had the exact opposite reaction whenever

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.620
 you started playing me.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.620
 Really?

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.980
 Some of that stuff I was like I can't believe that's coming out of that.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.140
 That's even better than I thought it was going to.

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.140
 Okay.

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.140
 Or like hope for.

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.140
 Cool.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.140
 The bass sounds surprised me.

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.740
 I was like oh it is good at bass.

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.140
 Absolutely.

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.620
 Even like sub bass.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.220
 I don't think I was expecting that.

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:49.020
 I thought it would be better for more higher toned metallic percussion stuff and like string

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.020
 like things.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.020
 You know what I mean?

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.180
 I wasn't expecting it to be like a mutant bass drum.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:57.460
 It's definitely got some really nice definition on low end.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.460
 You know what I mean?

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:03.060
 It even has some sub bass presets and some of the presets that I've made already were

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.580
 based on variations of those ones.

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.580
 You know what I mean?

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.380
 Because it just does it really well.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:12.020
 But in my head I'm like comparing it to elements.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.020
 You know?

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.020
 There's not too much out there.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.020
 It does physical modeling.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.020
 Right.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.020
 You're right.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.860
 I mean like you got, that's what you got.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.860
 You know what I mean?

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:20.860
 You got your elements.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:21.860
 You got your plonk now.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:25.100
 Braids has some rings.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.100
 Different rings also.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.900
 That's mostly your presentation.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.900
 So you know what I mean?

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.300
 Yeah I don't know.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.620
 Like for weird cussive stuff.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.460
 It's pretty limited.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.460
 You know what I mean?

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.980
 I mean I feel like we have to compare the two.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:44.860
 You get more out of elements I feel like that sounded different from each other.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:49.060
 I feel like elements, it was kind of like a set it and forget it type of thing.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:53.340
 You would dial in your sound, get it to where you want and then you could hit it with a

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.060
 variety of different modulations.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.420
 But you would just be working with that sound.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:02.980
 Whereas with plonk you can even cycle different presets.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.060
 You can morph things.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:11.780
 So you can jump from different types of sounds way way faster than you could ever do with

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.820
 elements even if you knew all the sweet spots that you wanted to dial in.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:15.820
 You know what I mean?

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.580
 Or sequence.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.220
 So it's definitely a faster workflow than elements for sure.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.980
 It's definitely a smaller footprint.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.580
 But I don't know.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.580
 I like it.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:32.340
 I'm just waiting to be like, I'm waiting to hit that spot where it like really blows

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.340
 my mind.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.340
 There we go.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.340
 Alright, I'll wind you out of the way.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.340
 I can barely do it.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.340
 What is that?

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.340
 Is that the BIA doing it?

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.340
 Yeah.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.340
 It sounds so wimpy.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.340
 Anywho.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:37:08.340
 I was hitting the best stimulus terrorist altar hitting the trigger.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:13.340
 Oh my god.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.340
 Where's that nice like 8-bit tone?

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.340
 I think that is because the attack isn't.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.340
 Oh yeah, okay.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:28.700
 Which I rarely normally set at noon just so I don't hear that 8-bit noise.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:29.700
 I'm modulating.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.340
 That's ornament and crime is doing its thing on it too.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:38.340
 Got quadraterias and then four LFOs and two for the inputs on there.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.340
 So Nick, you got a new fancy toil.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.340
 Oh yeah.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.340
 We got the ER301 which I'm like at this point.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.580
 I'm comfortable enough to talk about it.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:53.060
 I've likened it to the Octract but it's really more like a chain of things in Ableton.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.660
 But you can kind of nest those two.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:38:00.020
 And you could take any of those points of control and send CV to it.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:04.420
 And that's the cool thing I really like is that you can take one modulation source and

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:08.460
 send it to one of the 12 inputs which is pretty generous.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:12.700
 And then it's bipolar modulation to target anything you want.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:18.540
 So you can have one CV change like 60 parameters at the same time if you want with different

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.700
 amounts and levels and offsets for each one.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.260
 So they're like it's got two screens right, two LEDs.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:27.380
 The second one, that's where you end up assigning like CV coming in.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.260
 So you have 12 inputs and you can route any of those 12 pretty much anywhere.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.260
 Yeah, anywhere.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.260
 And you can take any one of them.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.340
 It's like one to many, not just like one to one.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.460
 So you can take any of those targets.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.500
 So it's really like it's plenty of control.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.460
 You can actually, I think it's cool because like the dude like he labels like the frequency

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:50.780
 ranges and everything for all the IO right here because you can do audio with these two.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:55.260
 But it's just limited and it's not the bandwidth of the actual true audio inputs which sound

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.260
 fucking good.

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.700
 Like the recordings are awesome.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.460
 It's got a six track recorder built in.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:06.060
 So you can do like four inputs recording but you can also do just monitor everything that's

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.100
 going on while you're recording too.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:12.820
 So one of the nice things is like you can you can have something just always recording

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:17.700
 everything that you're doing on the module and still have four channels of recording stuff.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:21.260
 So it's like just a record of what's going on which is really cool because even with

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.100
 a DAW you can't really do that.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:27.140
 If you hit you know certain things in Ableton if you stop it it stops recording but this

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:31.700
 is like constantly recording everything that you're doing which is really nice.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.540
 The resampling it's rad.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.140
 There's a learning curve to it but even I thought the aux track was harder to learn.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.180
 Honestly that thing took me like a half a year or a year to get used to.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.740
 This is like I don't even put too much time into it but once you get the general flow

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:50.660
 the hardest thing is just knowing like when to nest an envelope or like how to get to

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:55.100
 these screens and then when you get into it he's like all these nice shortcuts like there's

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.900
 a home button that just goes up.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.740
 There's an up button that goes up in the chain.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.500
 Home button double hit it takes you back to the start.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:08.820
 He's added a screenshot feature so you can like share kind of your patches or things

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.860
 that are going on which is kind of nice.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.820
 There aren't like there's a low pass filter right now.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.820
 There's no high pass.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:14.980
 There's no band.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:19.660
 What he knows it's on the roadmap like I've got to add a lot more of these basics and

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.420
 really he wants I think just a plug in framework so that other people can do that stuff like

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.740
 I think we mentioned before.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:29.540
 So you can record up four things at once.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.620
 How many can you play at once?

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.940
 Oh a four.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:33.940
 Okay.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.700
 Yeah so like four in four out types.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.700
 Yeah.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.660
 So you've got these buttons over here.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:42.500
 The corresponding you can link these to be stereo too.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.500
 It's actually.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.500
 So like two stereo pair?

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.500
 Yeah.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.500
 You can do two stereo pair.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.820
 You can do an individual mono.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:48.820
 And it's flexible.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.020
 You can do the mono here, the mono here and then stereo in the middle.

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.340
 It's got some depth to it for sure.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.420
 There are lots of parts that I haven't really gotten to.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:02.540
 One time we did a Prince James burning show in Philly and I had ordered that circuit bent

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.180
 Kawai drum machine.

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.180
 Oh yeah.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.220
 And it got shipped like way later than I wanted to.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.180
 Like originally I wanted to use that live and then the day that we were leaving for Philly

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.460
 it fucking shows up at the door.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.660
 I didn't even open the box.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:19.340
 I just threw it in the car with the rest of the gear and I spent an hour and a half in

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.820
 sound check just fucking with it.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.020
 And I was like trying to figure out where I could incorporate it.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.020
 So I did.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.420
 I just figured out a few spots in the set where like I could just improvise with it.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.180
 I had no idea what I was saying on the phone.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.420
 And it was circuit bent on top of that.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.260
 So I was like this thing's just going to shit itself live.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.580
 But I was like fucking I'm going to try it.

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.580
 Yeah.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.580
 I worked that all right.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.580
 I did that with the digitact of that last set.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:40.580
 I was like how did it meet?

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:41.580
 Yeah.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.460
 I was surprised to see it out on your table live.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.460
 I go okay.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.060
 I took it out at one point when I was practicing on the table at home.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.860
 I was like okay this is like it's a lot to manage.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:55.340
 I even mentioned previous podcasts like two drum machines like you're going to do this.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.780
 But it worked out well enough.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.900
 I like it together with the rhythm.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.220
 I think they complimented nicely.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.060
 It really seems like it would compliment any other electron box.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.060
 Yeah.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.060
 Really well drum.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:12.100
 You know hitting a machine drum with the MIDI tracks with the probabilistic stuff built

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.260
 in there now.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.260
 You know like that's a good idea.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:16.260
 That's a good idea.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:20.620
 I was thinking about that when I was looking at that machine drum that popped up for sale

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.340
 real cheap and I was like oh man.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:27.460
 I was like I can probably sequence that with a digitact and just the two of those alone

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.460
 would probably be a solid live set.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.460
 Yeah.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:37.900
 I mean maybe a synth box on top of it for your more synth line and atmospheric stuff.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.740
 The one thing I was thinking of though that would be a bad limitation is that you have

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:44.060
 more voices on the machine drum that you do MIDI tracks on the digit.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.060
 This is true.

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.220
 So you would be hard limited there.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.220
 Still eight.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.220
 Yeah.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.220
 It's pretty generous.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.540
 Yeah but it's just the fact that you wouldn't be able to utilize every voice on there.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.900
 That was the one limitation that popped into my head but other than that it seemed like

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.060
 it would be a cool combo.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.060
