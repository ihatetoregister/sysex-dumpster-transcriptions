00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 [Music]

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Yeah, Blade Runner.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Yeah, no spoilers.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 2049.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 So what did you think of it?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 I thought the movie was great.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 It was a good movie.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 I've heard mostly good things.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Yeah, I really dug it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 I tried to keep expectations really low.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Yeah, good life rule.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 But the soundtrack was not.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 I even tried to keep an open mind for it, but man was I disappointed with it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 That sucks you haven't seen it because I wanted to discuss certain parts

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 and I thought maybe you would.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Well, to be fair, my thoughts.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Our listeners may not have seen it as well.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 I didn't see it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Oh, you can see it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Well, all right.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 We watched the original again last week because Heather.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 That's all you need to see.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Oh, God, we got to crack this.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 It's just so typical like, Zimmer.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 There's parts where it's like, high action.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 And like, all of a sudden the music is just deafening.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 It's just like, brrr, you know, it's like these, it's like, orchestral hits.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 It's not even orchestral hits.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 It's this weird like, hyper saw that just blasts.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 It's like this big detuned saw sound that's just deafening.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 And it's just like, really?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 There's a few moments where it gets almost like travel percussive.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 And it sounds cool.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 And I'm like, okay, I bet you this is the direction that Johan was going to go.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 You know, but then like, every time it's an action moment.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 It like takes you away from the action because it's just so loud and just kind of shitty sound.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Yeah.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Like it does not sound like a Blade Runner soundtracks.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 It sounds like your typical like, wannabe action movie soundtrack.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Every time the stuff starts to get like, tense in action.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Yeah.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 And that just, I feel like that really ruined those moments for me.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Did you see that director talked about it and why?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 No.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Yeah, they said it was Johan's choice basically.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 But the director requested a soundtrack that was more, that was closer to the original sound.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 And apparently Johan wasn't providing that.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 And he was like, oh, well, kind of taking myself off of this.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 And they went to Han Zimmer to get a sound closer to the original sound.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Well, I don't know.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 I don't feel like he achieved that at all.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Right.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Like, not at all.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Yeah.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 I mean, there's a couple moments where it's ambient, like Vary's hanging out in his apartment and stuff like that.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 And you'll hear some like, you know, CS80 type sounds.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Yeah.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 I'm like, OK, that's cool.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 And that's the only place where they really needed to be music.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 You know what I mean?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 It's at the slower moments.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 The action should speak for itself.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 And it does in the original.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 You know what I mean?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Anytime there's like action in the original Blade Runner, it's where the sound kind of stops.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Right.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 You know?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Yeah.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 You hear, like, press, like, our hands hitting the floor type of thing.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Yeah.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 You hear your hearing, what's going on?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 You hear the rain.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 The weird, whooshing sound in the background.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 You know, all that shit.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Except for like, the death of Tyrell.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 You know what I mean?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.600
 There's like a swell of music there because it's like an impactful moment.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.120
 Other than that, like, that doesn't happen.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.880
 But in this movie, yeah, it's like every time it's like, oh, guess what?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.680
 This is an action part.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.520
 The music is just like, yeah.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.240
 It's just like, ah, all right.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.000
 It's like, thanks Hans, I didn't know.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.600
 That's fuck.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600
 Oh, well.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.600
 But it's a minor complaint.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.680
 I mean, it didn't do right too much from your overall enjoyment.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.360
 Honestly, at least seeing it in the iMacs on that sound system, I feel like it did ruin

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.360
 some of the more action moments for me.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.240
 Like, it was just distractingly loud over everything else in the movie.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.240
 You know what I mean?

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.600
 Well, maybe it was like trying to focus on the sounds happening in the movie and then

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.520
 it's just like this overbearing sound, which is what a lot of people said in interstellar

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.880
 and stuff too.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.920
 But that movie was kind of chill to begin with.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.200
 So I didn't mind the fact that you had like that roaring organ sound, you know, in the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.600
 iMacs it was deafening, but I liked it.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 Not so much in Blade Runner.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.520
 It was like, this needs to be scaled the fuck down.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.400
 Like, take it down a notch, Hans.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.520
 But maybe that was Hans taking it down a notch.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.040
 He just blows his nose.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.040
 If you go up to talk to him, he's just constantly screaming at you.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.680
 He has no sense of volume.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.320
 Hello!

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.280
 Maybe it'll be play better at home, like a home theater where it's not going to have

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.080
 that crazy ass super loud system.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.080
 Sure.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.320
 It'll be a little bit more diminished.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.440
 The sound overall, I feel, is great though.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.400
 You know, it sucks your parts where you couldn't hear it, because it was just drowned out in

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.400
 the soundtrack ship.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.000
 But yeah, overall, I feel like the sound work and sound design, it was really solid.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 It's long, right?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Like three hours.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 It's the three hours, yeah.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.080
 And we went for like, we didn't know it was that long.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.360
 We went to the 1045 showing, which didn't start until like 11.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.360
 Yeah.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360
 And this was a weeknight.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.360
 Nice.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360
 Yeah.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.160
 And like, we got out of the theater and it's 3am.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.040
 I'm like, what the fuck?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.040
 I'm sorry, I did not expect that.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.040
 But so we could get into the Synthrotech mess.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.040
 Oh, Jesus.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.800
 It's going to down.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.960
 The elephant in the room.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.960
 Yeah.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.640
 Actually, it's not kind of a downer, it is a downer.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.360
 It sucks too, because it went from like the Muffwiggler controversy to that, like back

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.360
 to back.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.240
 And I was just like, what the hell is going on?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.800
 If there was a Euro-Rax stock market, it would have dipped to a little bit of that period.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.280
 Got them out, the Great Depression of 2017.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:46.920
 It was just a fantastic explosion in self-reveal of somebody's like fucked up notions of the

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.840
 world and bias towards things and how you can let your company kind of be your platform

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.240
 for political things, which is just dumb.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.240
 Yeah.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.240
 That's just like, you're, it's suicide, man.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.600
 Like, what do you, all because you got hyped up one day on some of your, your ideals that

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.680
 you felt were infringed upon, you use like your company's social media to promote your

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.480
 shittiness.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.480
 Fuck him.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.240
 Fuck what he's done to his company.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.240
 Fuck his videos.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240
 Fuck his self-righteous.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.440
 There's a crusade against me.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.440
 Blah, blah, blah.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.960
 That was the most disgusting part is that he's trying to play victim-thright.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.240
 Yeah, that was the war.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.240
 That was the war.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.240
 I'm like, what?

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.240
 Yeah.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.720
 And then that turned into like him backpedaling and being like free speech, which is again,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.040
 that's like, oh, you just, it's also free speech to criticize you, you realize.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.520
 And then the whole like, it's punk rock to say obnoxious racist shit.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.360
 And then like posting on his Instagram, like old bands that had like, you know, hooded

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.800
 like clan members on their punk rock stickers and how you can talk about anything, guys.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.560
 Well, you do know like when they did that, it was typically against it.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.560
 Yeah.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.560
 They were using the swab lometry.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.920
 They were using it to contrast the opposite of that.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.160
 They were saying, well, not a little marketing tactic.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.160
 Exactly.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.160
 Yeah.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.160
 Yeah.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.160
 Which is what he's doing.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.480
 He's doing the T-shirts with Baphomet element.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.880
 Why are you using the image of Baphomet, if you're not?

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.880
 Yeah.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.840
 And if he's got, if he's a Christian, fine.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.560
 There wouldn't have been any problem with that.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.760
 It's, I mean, at least maybe I'm speculating and speaking for myself.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.080
 It's the using this, using his energy against Planned Parenthood.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.080
 And then just turn around and go, oh, you just don't like me because I'm Christian.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.200
 Someone that worked for him come out on Facebook and said like, they were kind of like forced

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.280
 to go to Planned Parenthood protests and shit.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.880
 That's incredible.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.760
 That would have been my last day there.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.760
 Yeah.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.760
 Yeah.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.760
 I don't think you're getting it, man.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.920
 He was trying to be the whole like sheep and with closing thing.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.560
 He was trying to use imagery that was the opposite of what he likes.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.560
 You know what I mean?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.160
 To appeal to people like outside of his, you know, ideals.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.160
 Yeah.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.560
 You know, like, even said that one of his videos like, oh, you know, I'm in Portland and, you

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.560
 know, I infiltrated all these hippies and shit.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.560
 And I'm like, what are you talking about?

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.560
 Good job.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.520
 Let's say, okay, so you're lying phony sack of shit.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520
 What are you so proud about?

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.200
 Like, well, I tricked you guys.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.040
 I got you to buy my t-shirts and I don't even believe in that shit.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.640
 I was like, okay.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.200
 And I did suffer through watching all five of those videos he posted.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.080
 I don't know how you made it through.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.560
 I watched 30 seconds of the first one.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.560
 Yeah.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.240
 And I hit unsubscribe and I was just like shaking my head.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.840
 I was like, this is so cringy.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.760
 He's like in this dark basement.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.760
 Yeah.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.960
 And it's Alex Jones looking to do.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.960
 Yeah.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.080
 It sucks for his employees and, you know, whoever else was involved in the production of these

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.760
 modules because if you look on you sites and they're just, they're everywhere now.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.240
 No one wants anything to do with this.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.240
 Yeah.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.240
 And it's not because of his ideals.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.080
 It's because he's lying.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.040
 He just flat out been lying about everything.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.120
 If you want to run a Christian company, put that in the forefront.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.640
 Say this is what I stand for.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.160
 This is what my business is.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.160
 Exactly.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.160
 You know what I mean?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.200
 I don't subscribe to that, but that would not have stopped me from buying a shit.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.200
 Like, is that cool?

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200
 Good job, man.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.360
 The fact that he was like, oh, I've been lying to you people the whole time and trying

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.160
 to play this victim card.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.760
 It's like, okay, why would I want to support you?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.760
 Yes.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.400
 And then follows that up with my mom is the CEO of Nabisco.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.960
 I'm a trust fund kid.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.760
 I don't need money, but it's priceless watching you all freak out over this.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.800
 And that's like, oh, dude, you're just like the bottom of the fucking barrel.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.000
 And what does he expect in the result of that to be?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.960
 Is he just getting off on being a troll or is it going to be that thing of like, ha, ha,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.640
 you got us, man.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.640
 We find that really endearing.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.280
 I think that's the thing.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.400
 Because now he's like posting like pictures of shipping crates and it's like, oh, Monday

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.680
 was a great thanks for all the orders, guys.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.360
 And it's like, well, maybe your last Monday was twice as big.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360
 You know, it's like this.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.640
 And again, I think we're all metrics there.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.640
 Yeah.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.720
 We're all becoming sensitive because of like fuck boy president where it's like, you know,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.240
 it's like the pushing of the exact opposite of what's actually happening as news.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.640
 Putting stuff like that out is very Trumpian.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.640
 Exactly.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.640
 Yeah.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.720
 Like there wasn't a lot of people out for my inauguration.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.480
 Here's 3,000 pictures of trying to convince you how big my fucking inauguration is.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.160
 And just dude, you're trying way too fucking hard.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.680
 Like no one's buying it.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.640
 And he also pulled the, oh, well, people in China are going to buy my shit anyway.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.640
 You guys, nothing.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.160
 All my sales are from China.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.120
 It's like, do you like, okay.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.720
 Just digging yourself a grave and like putting dirt on top of it.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.720
 Yeah.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.120
 He just crawled up on the cross and no one's paying attention to him.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.200
 It is a bummer because I do have this stuff.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.400
 I do have synthesis of tech stuff I've built and since we've all, we all have.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400
 We all have.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.440
 And it's the joke's all on us.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.600
 But I'm looking at him.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.440
 I'm just like, I can't have this.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.440
 Like I have to get rid of stuff.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.600
 Like just so much of his stuff appeared that day in the you section on the box.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.200
 It was just like, boom.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.240
 I mean, I've accepted him to lose money on it because like you said, all of that stuff

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.240
 is still going for pennies too.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.240
 And no one wants to just take this shit.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.240
 Exactly.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.640
 So I think I've actually thought about like just selling all of it and just donating it

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.480
 to Planned Parenthood.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.080
 Whatever I would ever anyone's want.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.080
 That's awesome.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.080
 Yeah.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.280
 And like I have a shirt, I got a bunch of stickers, I got the koozy.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.360
 Basically I'm just putting it all in a box, putting it up there.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.720
 And it's not like any of his designs were all that unique or special anyway.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.280
 It's not like it's going to be hard to replace anything that he is released.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.280
 No, not at all.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.080
 The only thing that was appealing about it was a lot of it you could get DIY and it

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.080
 was cost effective.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.360
 Well, it was very simple.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.520
 I think that was like the sequencer that was dirt simple.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.520
 Yeah.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.520
 That echo was you had three knobs.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.520
 I don't know.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.360
 It seems weird to start complimenting his designs.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.360
 I don't think they were that bad because they were very performance friendly.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.280
 That doesn't just that's not enough to keep it though.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.720
 Seeing that fucking logo just turns my stomach down.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.880
 It's too small of a community.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.040
 We know half the people we buy this stuff from.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.040
 It just feels weird to feel shitty about using a piece of gear, which you will just because

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.960
 you know that asshole.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.960
 It's like anything else.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.440
 It's like, oh, that guy is awesome.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.600
 Or that guy's a weirdo, but he's a cool weirdo.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.600
 Which is totally exceptional.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.960
 I mean, even his whole political standpoint and ideal side, that still doesn't excuse

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.680
 any of the sexist shit that he was doing by far.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.960
 Once he posted that stupid meme that no one got anyways, there were so many females that

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.960
 were coming out on the forums saying, oh, this is the same dude that added me on Facebook

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.040
 and then proceeded to like and leave creepy comments on all my selfies.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.040
 It's shit like that.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.080
 So he had an ironic meme putting a picture of a monster.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.040
 And then to turns out that he actually is just as creepy?

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.040
 Or you know, yeah.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.040
 Exactly.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.040
 Again.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.040
 He comes on who?

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.040
 Again, good job, man.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.040
 You really got to run us.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.040
 You showed us.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.040
 Fuck that.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.080
 We all learned our lesson.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.680
 I'm proud though at how quickly people didn't really feed the troll.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680
 I mean, some did.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.760
 But for the most part, I want to just say, oh, okay, fuck you.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.880
 And just like immediately dumped his shit, stopped carrying his shit.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.880
 There was no apologies.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.880
 And there was no apologies.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.760
 That's what I like to see.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.800
 There was no, well, I mean, hey, you know, he's entitled to his.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.800
 There was some.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800
 Oh, was it?

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.800
 I thought that over mostly on like the Facebook groups.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.800
 Oh, okay.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.360
 You know, I personally got into an argument with a couple of people just because I commented

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.040
 it and all of a sudden I was like targeted by these people like, whoa, you just don't

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.040
 get it type of shit.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.120
 And I'm like, no, I think I do get it.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.560
 Unfortunately, I think I do get it.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.320
 Yeah, really not that complex.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.360
 I may not be an edgelord, but I can still understand.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.400
 This is my first rodeo on the internet.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.080
 I've been on 4chan since 2004.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.640
 I know a basement dweller when I see one.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.240
 I'm going to jack off.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.280
 For our listeners who are not from the Pittsburgh area, jack off is an insult.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.840
 You can figure out what it means.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.440
 It means you're a jack off.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.240
 So there's no real discussion here.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.640
 It seems like we're all kind of an agreement.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.640
 That's true.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.640
 Yeah.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.800
 I think we need someone here to bounce these off of these opinions off of them so they

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.920
 can tell us their side and what we're not seeing, I guess.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.360
 I will say I'm probably going to keep that fucking cable holder.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.800
 Yeah, I actually don't have anything to replace that with.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.240
 There's nothing like that that exists.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.560
 Fuck you for making me keep that thing.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.720
 I wonder if he designed that or if he just slapped his name on it.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.480
 Like maybe we could find where he...

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.160
 Can we paint sourced that from?

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.920
 Can we make some pink ones for Planned Parenthood?

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.920
 Oh, I'll paint my name.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.600
 Maybe that's what we need to do.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.600
 The first 6x dumpster product.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.400
 Maybe we can make some of these things.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.160
 I'm sure it's not that complicated to like...

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.960
 I think we're on to something.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960
 Yeah, pink ones.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.960
 Yeah, that's a good thing.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.960
 We got to do that.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960
 So...

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.800
 If a purchase gets a free beer cozy and we'll send them on his plan apparently.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.960
 You honestly wouldn't even need to make it out of the metal.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.040
 You could do it in acrylic if you...

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.040
 Like 3D print them.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.040
 Yeah, exactly.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.040
 I think we're on to something.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.040
 Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.040
 Yeah, I love it.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.040
 Alright, yeah, the beer.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.120
 What do you think of the sequench?

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.120
 It's good.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.120
 I like it.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.120
 I haven't had it before.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120
 What is it?

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.120
 Sequench.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.120
 Which is a...

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120
 Lime juice.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.120
 For sour, yeah.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.120
 Lime juice, black limes.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.120
 And sea salt.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.120
 Sea salt.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.120
 That sounds tasty.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.120
 That's pretty good.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120
 It's very sour.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.240
 I think you have to say the whole name to get for it to be the pun.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.240
 Sequench ale?

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.240
 Yeah.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.240
 Yeah.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240
 Sequench ale circuits.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.240
 Yeah.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.240
 Yeah.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.240
 Yeah.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.240
 Sequench ale circuits.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.240
 Yeah.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.240
 Electron.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.240
 Electron.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.240
 Ok.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.240
 Electron.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.240
 Octotrack shipping.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.240
 Yeah.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.240
 It is being shipped.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.240
 Some people have them in hand.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.240
 Screens look pretty.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.240
 It looks very nice.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.160
 Someone even took a picture of like from a camera angle way down low.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.160
 You know what I mean?

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.440
 And you could still see the screen.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.600
 And like you know all the Mark 1 screen.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.600
 So we have to be like directly hovering over it.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.600
 Yeah.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.600
 Looking straight down.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.440
 So yeah, the screen looks excellent.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.300
 The new buttons look useful.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.740
 It's really tempting to get another Octotrack Mark 2.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.240
 Now that it has like the new OS and stuff.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.240
 Yeah.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.140
 Are the buttons like the keys on the DigiTac?

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.140
 Yeah.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.140
 They're nice.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.140
 They're not like them.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.140
 Yeah.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.140
 The shortcut keys.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.140
 Nice.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.140
 Mm-hmm.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.740
 Less stuff buried in there.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.500
 Bring some stuff up to the forefront a bit.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.100
 Get three LFOs for track.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.500
 Get different effects.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.260
 You know, different types of reverbs.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.860
 You get more filters.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:42.100
 It's like cost twice the price, but you are getting like more than double the features.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.100
 Yeah.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.100
 Yeah.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.100
 So it's I don't know.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.100
 It's a tough one.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.780
 I mean, personally I'm all in on the DigiTac.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.780
 Yeah.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.700
 I feel like I'm also, you know, everyday finding new shit to do and to use with it.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.580
 I don't think I'm going to run out anytime soon with it.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.820
 The Octotrack is a lot less enticing for me.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.420
 Because the price or just too much stuff.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.420
 The price.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.420
 Gotcha.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.380
 The DigiTac is exactly how much I want to spend for that functionality.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.380
 Yeah.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:12.060
 I agree that the price point is what ultimately got me to bolt the trigger.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.220
 I feel like the DigiTac was actually for what you get.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.700
 It was decently priced for once.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.700
 Yeah.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.700
 I agree.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.700
 It's a good deal.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.700
 I still don't understand the heat though.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.540
 I mean, at least with the Octotrack there's so much shit in it.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:29.020
 It's like impossible to find one for under $700 right now for a distortion pedal essentially.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.020
 Yeah.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.340
 So those of you who had the Octotrack before are the new features in it.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.660
 Stuff that you've been like had wanted in the past.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.660
 Yeah.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.020
 Is it a market improvement over the first one?

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.860
 It gets there.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.020
 The buttons on the interface look like they would make it faster to use.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.100
 I've seen one person comment that had one before.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.620
 They're like, oh, I didn't even go on back to the manual.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.420
 I haven't had one in a few years because the buttons now I'm like, oh, here's the feature.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.820
 The cool thing about the new electron buttons of course is you can do the printing on the

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.380
 button or else before they never had anything printed on them.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.900
 So you could put like a number or whatever it is on there and then have like more information

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:09.020
 below it printed on the screen or on the panel.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.260
 But you know, no new effects.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.060
 Specs wise, it's pretty much the same.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.580
 The new display is good.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.220
 Balanced inputs and outputs would make it kind of nicer.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:22.580
 There were always some level issues I felt with it with recording and it was kind of tricky

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:27.820
 to get the levels right in the internal mixer.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.820
 But I don't know.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.700
 For a moment I was like, I kind of want one but now I'm fully over it.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.140
 And again, it's like I was using the Digitact a lot on the couch last night and I was like,

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.340
 no, this is what I want.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.340
 Like this does the trick basically.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.820
 Even though to what you say, I want more LFOs and more effects.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.900
 That's the only thing I feel is limited is it's not like Digitact isn't great for sound

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.900
 design.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.420
 It's something like I can pitch something up and down and I can put an effect on it.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.540
 I can use an LFO to change something but then you're done.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.540
 Right.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.540
 So again, it's a known limit.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.540
 It's good for drums.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.540
 Yeah.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:05.940
 I wish there was some rudimentary functions like that in the Digit but I don't know.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.940
 I'm a big fan of time stretch as an effect.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.940
 Yeah.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.580
 And Deokta I feel like due to its time stretch abilities was always a good mangeller especially

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.340
 when he drops loops in there.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.340
 Yeah.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.620
 Basically I was using it for when I owned one.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.540
 Originally I wasn't using it as a drum machine or even a sampler.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.580
 I was dumping loops into it and just mangelling shit.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.580
 Yeah.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.460
 You can't really do that with the Digit.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.460
 Unfortunately.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.460
 Now it's at the same sort of algorithm.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.860
 I mean will it fall apart in the same sort of way if you did the time stretching compared

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.100
 to the Mark 1?

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.100
 Yeah.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.580
 I don't think much has changed in that regard.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.180
 I mean essentially the same OS.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.100
 Like I think the OS runs on both devices.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.100
 Yeah.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.100
 It will.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.100
 It's like oh wow.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.100
 Yeah.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.100
 You get the trigger conditions on the new one.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.100
 Yeah.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.860
 They haven't released it yet but I know that it looks like they found people are reporting

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.860
 bugs.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.540
 And before the Oct track was very stable there were a few known bugs that were documented

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.660
 that some people ran into that were like that's not show stopper.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.660
 And they ran out of space.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:08.660
 So they must have found some way to free up some space to add the trigger condition stuff.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.660
 I don't know.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.660
 Because before they were just like no it's full it's full.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.660
 Or just a little bit more.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.660
 Yeah.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.300
 Because I know they did that with the ornament and crime where they were like oh it's out

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.740
 of space but maybe let's take out oh we had all this USB stuff that only mattered for

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.740
 development.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.500
 They took it out and freed up a bunch of space and that's how they started to make some

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.500
 changes again.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.500
 Oh cool.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.940
 So maybe they just figured out something they could cut out.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.940
 I don't know.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.140
 Or some library dependency that was just not needed.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.340
 That type of shit ends up beating up space.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.340
 Yep.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.340
 But it looks beautiful.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.340
 It does.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.340
 I'm really tempted.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.380
 I could easily see having a digi and that.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.380
 You know what I mean?

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:48.900
 Like using the Octa as my looper manger you know fuck shit up box and keeping my digi

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.060
 as like a drum machine basically.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.060
 Yeah.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.700
 Which is how I've been using it.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.580
 I'd be curious to A, B, the sound just like put the same sample.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.740
 Like the encoders itself?

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.780
 Yeah the encoders and just like the output because I always noticed like I was using the

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:08.620
 rhythm a lot the past few days and I was using the digi tag last night and I hit just one

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.740
 sample and I'm like damn that sounds like really clear and good.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.740
 On the digi.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:13.740
 Yeah.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.740
 Yeah.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.740
 The rhythm is always just like kind of muddy.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.740
 Absolutely.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.740
 Not in a bad way but it's.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.380
 I feel like all the Mark 1's have always suffered from the muddy sin sound which is what

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.260
 these Mark 2's are supposed to change to.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:28.740
 They said the inputs and outputs have been updated on the Octa and yeah if we're using

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:34.100
 the digi as a you know example that's what they're going to sound like then that's good

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.500
 because yeah the digi sounds nice.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.500
 It really does.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.540
 Sort of like the first of the Mark 2 type writing.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.340
 Like even it's a Mark 1 for the digi.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.340
 Yeah.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.540
 It represents the new standards they're going to have.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:49.140
 I always thought it was the filters and the Mark 1 electron stuff.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.180
 But then I noticed like even on the rhythm if you disable like filtering and stuff it's

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:59.540
 still thin it's not like the A4 thin now which everything out of that box sounded.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.540
 That was rough.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.540
 Yeah.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.580
 It just sounded like it just lacked depth to the sound.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.140
 You know what I mean I guess it's just the encoders or the outputs rather.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.140
 Yeah.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:13.460
 I don't know but if everything if all the Mark 2's are going to sound like the outputs

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.980
 of the digi then that's that's a good improvement over all the Mark 1's.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:36.500
 I'm liking the STS and I have to install the new OS but at the same time it's still

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.500
 kind of limited.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.580
 You can only do 10 samples you know what I mean.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.780
 This is the 4 millisecond stereo triggered sampler we're talking about.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.780
 Yes.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.780
 The 4.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.780
 Yes.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:48.780
 Very nice module.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.980
 Yeah the new firmware just dropped yesterday.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.180
 It improves the latency that it was having.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.620
 It improves some of the features like being able to save state when you power down.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.860
 That was my biggest complaint that I emailed Dan about before that shows like is there any

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.860
 way.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:10.580
 I was like I'm not finding it in the manual to have this thing remember you know my place.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.980
 Yeah when I shut it down he was like no so we're trying to implement the future though.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:20.860
 It's in there now so it's also half the price of an octa track in comparison it's like you

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.300
 know what I mean.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:28.660
 It is really sweet to be able to trigger long samples within the modular though and record

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.580
 stuff on the fly.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.020
 It's tough call.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.060
 So many sampling options now.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.540
 You know like I don't even worry.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.300
 Yeah this is just blowing up for samplers.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.180
 What are the new things on the DISTING the Mark 4 is the sampler.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.180
 It has a sampler.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.500
 Oh yeah you're not talking about that.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.220
 So Mark 3 had the sampler but now they've updated it and they have that new screen which

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.380
 makes it look way easier to navigate some of that.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.220
 So I didn't even realize the Mark 3 had a sampler because I looked at the first one.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:59.180
 I was like oh this is really cool and it was like 16 algorithms and it was an interesting

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:03.300
 thing and I just sort of like never got one never really paid attention to it.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.360
 Saw that they made new ones and then the fourth one like popped up and I saw they'd

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.360
 added the screen.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.860
 I'm like oh I'm gonna give this another.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.900
 I'm gonna look at this again.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.540
 76 algorithms SD slot to load samples and MIDI files.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.860
 Yeah that was nuts.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.620
 It looks like they've really gone over the top and it's only like $10 more than it had

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.620
 been.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.580
 I think the third one did sample playback but this one I'll actually do like stereo or

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.020
 core down stereo playback which is kind of crazy.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.220
 Yeah it's for that.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:34.420
 I'm definitely tempted to get to get it and even if I don't use the sampler I'll use one

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.500
 of the 75 other things it does.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:43.940
 It looks like it was just crammed as much as possible into a tiny 4HP little monster machine.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.380
 I see I'm kind of the opposite now.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.500
 I've been getting out of like all in one modules.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.980
 That's why I saw it a good chunk of my beautiful stuff because I noticed like I'll just plain

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.900
 forget you know what I mean?

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.900
 Everything that it can do.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.900
 Yeah.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.420
 And I'll only use it for like one function generally.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.500
 What's my problem with the ornament and crime?

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.500
 Yeah.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.180
 Is that can only have one program loaded and the whole time I'm like well I want I like

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.180
 all of them.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.180
 Exactly.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.460
 Then you have to get multiple and if you're getting multiples at that point it's like

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:17.980
 you might as well just buy a couple like single you know one trick pony modules that do this

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.980
 and do very well.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.580
 That's why I got repeat.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.940
 You know because I kept forgetting all the other modes or I was just using it for an

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:28.140
 LFO or I was just using it for a VCA and then I want to use both or something and I'm just

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.180
 okay well then why do I have this module?

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:35.580
 I could just get a tiny VCA and a tiny LFO and I don't have to mess around with different

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.980
 modes and remembering what knob does what.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.980
 Yeah.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:39.980
 You know I don't know.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:45.100
 I don't mind the modes thing because I also got the Pico DSP but there's only eight.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.100
 Right.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.660
 It's very bright colors.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.820
 For some reason in my mind they make sense like red for bit crusher.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.820
 Yeah yeah.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.820
 That makes sense.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.820
 I figured you'd dig that man.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.740
 That's why I recommended to you like I was like David would be on this but it sounds good.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.820
 I don't know you actually got one.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.820
 Yeah.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.820
 I remember recommended.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.320
 Thank you for the recommendation because I didn't really give it a bit of a bit of

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.320
 a shot and it sounds great.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320
 Me.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320
 Yeah.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.820
 I bought one before that show because I was like I need another reverb.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.660
 I mean I have a shit ton of reverb but I couldn't fit anymore in my live rig.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.820
 I needed something small and I was looking at that.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.900
 I was like this thing's only three HP and it has a couple different reverb modes.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.980
 I was like I'm sure it doesn't sound amazing but it'll probably do what I want for live

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.300
 and I got one and I immediately purchased the second one.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.300
 I was like this is great.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.140
 It's a hell of a module.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.380
 It's stereo out too.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.220
 Yeah.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.220
 That's cool.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.880
 Only mono in but yeah it's pretty cool.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.880
 You get eight algorithms?

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.880
 Yeah.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.720
 A lot of them are different delays.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.880
 Like you got your ping pong delay or whatever your time sync delay, your granular delay,

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.440
 two reverb modes.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.840
 One is like a distorted delay and the other is just like your typical like haul delay

00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:02.120
 with like a filter on it and then there's like a bit crusher and there was like a phaser.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.400
 Well actually it's more than a bit crush.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.920
 It's also like an amp distortion too.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.720
 It has like two different ways depending on which knob you turn.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:14.000
 Like one knob is just like amp distortion and the second knob is like a sample rate

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 bit crush.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 That's cool.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.880
 Yeah for three HP you know it's pretty awesome.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.200
 It's a lot of power.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:24.840
 Speaking of the peaks though, that and braids and clouds are all dead.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.840
 Yeah.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.840
 Which is crazy.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.840
 Yeah.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.040
 Braids and clouds are the only mutables I own aside from ears so it's kind of weird that

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.240
 they're dead because clouds I love.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.360
 The very complexity that he dislikes is something I like.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.120
 I think we've talked about that before.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.760
 The only reason that I pulled a trigger on clouds initially was because it did more than

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.280
 just the main mode you know which really wasn't all that appealing to me.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.760
 But all the other modes combined I was like yeah I could definitely see me using this

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.760
 thing and I did.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.760
 I used all the modes fairly often.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.760
 It's really live.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.640
 Like I love to use in the looping delay live.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.160
 That was like a fun one.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.000
 Yeah it's weird to see that he's like I don't know.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.680
 I'm not feeling that module anymore.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.080
 I think you mentioned before I hope he's just like getting ready to drop the new hotness.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.080
 Yeah yeah.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.080
 Yeah.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.600
 He's doing like out with the old him with the new type of thing.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.640
 I hope you know what I mean.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.160
 And not that he's just burnt out.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.160
 Yeah.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.360
 I mean he announced something called marbles but he didn't say what the hell it is.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.960
 That's literally just a bag of marbles.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.960
 Yeah.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.960
 I'm done.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.960
 Fuck you.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.760
 Bag of marbles with a contact mic.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.320
 I'd probably buy it.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.680
 So I don't know if that's going to be like the clouds replacement or if it's something

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.960
 new entirely but curious to see what he's going to come up with.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.360
 I'm like you wouldn't have bought it without parasites.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.360
 Yeah.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.960
 That was what tipped me over to like oh it's got a ton of stuff in here.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.960
 Yeah.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.960
 I use it all.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.960
 So I tried that.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:50.960
 What was it?

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.960
 Camera all be one.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.960
 Never tried that one.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.520
 I eventually ended up back on the factory mode for a minute.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.160
 I still have the one that you loaded on it which is like parasites 1.2.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.560
 They're just certain like sounds and I don't afraid to lose on it.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.560
 Yeah.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.680
 Speaking of which the rain maker had a pretty significant update that was in beta for a

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.680
 while.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.640
 We found some issues that do do with the sink which I didn't try.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.960
 Seems to sink very well now.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.440
 I did upgrade mine.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.960
 Sounds completely different.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.960
 Yeah.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.880
 Couldn't be too much more different.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.880
 Way cleaner.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.840
 It almost sounds like it was broken before even though there are certain things about

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.800
 the way it was before that I kind of miss.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800
 Sure.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.600
 One of the new features is auto gain compensation so you can't go too crazy with the feedback.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.920
 You can push it really far and it'll kind of not explode through the range.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.000
 It's kind of controlled but that was some of the very stuff that I thought was very interesting.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.240
 I was just gonna say it doesn't sound good though.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.120
 It's hard to say because I don't have two to like A/B it and then bring mine over today

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.280
 because it's kind of all patched up with a bunch of stuff.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.760
 I like it but it's like I don't mind memory of what it used to be like kind of recedes

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.400
 the more I use it too.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.360
 So I'm not mad at it right now but I know it sounds different and I like some of the

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.560
 clean stuff I've been getting out of it but I don't think I'm gonna update mine.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.480
 Yeah I wouldn't.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.600
 I rely on the nastiness of it too much.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.920
 I mean sometimes yeah it is too nasty.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.720
 Yeah I mean like I can definitely push it into territory where it's unusable.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.720
 Any of no bugs.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.840
 No not that I've found that bug fix.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.640
 Yeah yeah but yeah I mean it can get off the rails pretty quickly.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.760
 It added some stuff like you can randomize the randomizations right now which is like

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.360
 that's cool but random kind of does the trick for me anyway.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.760
 I don't need to randomize how it's randomizing it so much but then you're gonna want to randomize

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.600
 that so randomize the randomize of your randomize deeper.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.400
 I forget what else I'm adding.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:54.320
 Oh they fixed um there were some things in the delay that weren't like some of the delay

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.600
 lines had some glitches or something that not correct technically but maybe it was some

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:05.560
 of the very stuff that was influencing its older sound but the shame is you can't um

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.400
 there's no download for the old firmware.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.120
 Oh so I think you're stuck.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.120
 Thanks for the heads up.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.600
 I'm sure he would give it up because I was even thinking that.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.040
 Yeah I was even thinking I was like well maybe I could just try the new firmware and if I don't

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.040
 like it I was down great.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.440
 So there's not like a github forward or anything like that.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.280
 I don't think they're on github.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.400
 It's on his site but there's no versioning.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.520
 It's just like here's the new firmware because before there wasn't a firmware update it was

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.240
 just the stock one.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.400
 I'd use a Mac at home so I had to set up windows VM and then download the programming software

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:44.200
 from the FPGA company which wasn't too hard like he has a video that walks you through

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.200
 it pretty straightforward.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.840
 It didn't take too long to update but.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.800
 Is it the same as like the metropolis updater and all that shit?

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.720
 That little USB thing you stick on the back?

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:59.200
 Yeah well this one it was just a micro USB for the display and then a mini USB for the

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.320
 FPGA in the back of it because you have to update the display too.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.360
 Well that's not saying about the warps parasite.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.760
 They kept the original factory on the end of the dial so you could call up all of those

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.760
 back.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.160
 I didn't have to sacrifice it and I thought that was a cool idea.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.160
 Yeah.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.960
 Still kind of want one of those.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.520
 I fucking love it.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:24.280
 And yeah and with parasites you get that the original firmware and then all the crazy

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.280
 shit he added so there's no sacrifice.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.720
 Alright that's cool.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.720
 Mutable dude.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.240
 Olivia is that right?

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:36.080
 Yeah he even said that like warps is one of the ones that he's actually really happy

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.160
 with currently and that he isn't killing or changing.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.160
 Oh that's awesome.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.640
 Yeah it's because it's a great module.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:56.920
 There's all kinds of stuff you can do with it.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.120
 I still can't believe you got rid of that defibrillator.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.720
 I only had the two cases you know.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.360
 Now that Mantis is in the picture and taking some of the utility modules out of the other

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.880
 two rigs and the fact that Mantis exists and I could get another one and fit it in.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880
 Yeah I do.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.040
 Definitely miss my D-fib.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:21.600
 I kind of have a, I saw someone made mention of a request for the 352 and I kind of want

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.600
 it now too.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:28.080
 I want to be able to turn the course knob off so even if I move it it doesn't change

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.840
 the pitch and that it will just have the pitch from the one volt per octave input.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.920
 Could you just turn the course all the way down?

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.920
 I mean that's what I've been doing.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.040
 Yeah you could do that and then just adjust all your input voltages that way.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.160
 I kind of keep it in the middle or all the way down or something like that but I would

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.800
 still like it so that I still bump into it when I'm using it live.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.480
 I'm like fuck because it changes the melody and you've got to find where you were at and

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.360
 sometimes if you're not an extreme, that sucks.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.960
 So it would be cool if he would put like a just disable knob.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:05.400
 Yeah just take it from this EV input but literally my only request or complaint for

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.400
 that module.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.880
 Yeah I still have an updated mine but I need to.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.880
 Yeah I dig that thing.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.240
 Man why you gotta bring up the fibrillator.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:18.440
 Now I'm thinking about it again I'm like I'd love to run that 3523 thing.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.800
 Yup that was a hell of a filter.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.800
 It was just gigantic dude.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.480
 That's why I never got one but every time I would come over and hear you use it or use

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.600
 it I'd be like god damn this is good.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.400
 It's like the best MS20 clone I've ever heard.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.400
 I agree.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.840
 And I've tried a few of them yeah and that one was just like oh this is what I've been

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.840
 looking for you know.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.840
 Ah damn it.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.840
 I'm sorry.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.320
 I think it was hard to come by now.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.160
 I was gonna ask you like what are they going for.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.960
 Like you never see them used they're just like non-existent.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.680
 Yeah I bought that when I was up in Toronto from Mugh music.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.680
 He only had one.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.320
 He had to give me the display model.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.320
 Oh this shit.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.440
 Yeah he had all the AS stuff up there man.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.440
 All of it.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.800
 I got to play with it and I was just like having a blast dude.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.040
 I was like oh I love all this shit.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.760
 I'll never buy it but I love it.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.400
 That's the first time I ever got to play with all that stuff in person.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.760
 You know like he had everything on the floor from them.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.480
 I was like that's fucking cool.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.840
 Because he's like even had the little shit I came here and was calling out.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.760
 The guy with the dot matrix.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.640
 Oh the Russian style one.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640
 Vostok?

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.640
 Vostok yes.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.440
 Yeah that and they had the telemark.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.440
 Yeah and all that stuff.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.040
 I was like oh man.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.640
 You had two of their modules right.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.600
 Whoops the other one.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:38.560
 I tried the VCO but it was kind of lackluster in my opinion.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.680
 It had a very very limited frequency range.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.680
 That was big too.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.160
 Yeah that was another monster.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.680
 Yeah it was supposed to be like a bass oscillator.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.280
 I don't know why I'm drawing a blank on the name right now.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.880
 I think it had saw on the name.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.640
 Yeah I think you're right.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.640
 Dual saw.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.640
 There we go.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.640
 That's it.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:03.200
 I think I paid 340 Canadian when I bought it.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.840
 Which is ten dollars.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.000
 Yeah I kind of missed that thing.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.240
 It was good for like feedback and shit.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.720
 But the thing that gave it most character was like the distortion and shit.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.640
 Yeah but I got enough shit for that now.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.240
 Speaking of filters though did you see that what is it?

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.880
 The J80 or what the hell is it called?

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.880
 Oh that.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.880
 What is it?

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.880
 The Jove.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.880
 The Jove.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.880
 System 80?

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.680
 No I haven't seen this.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.640
 It's a Jupiter 6 clone using not rare parts.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640
 Who's making it?

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.640
 Is it a kit?

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.840
 System 80 the same people that make that like 808 in your rack.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:47.560
 It's really beautiful and has like step buttons you can actually put human fingers on.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:54.320
 But yeah that module is tempting because I sold my am since Jupiter 6 vcf cloned Russ

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.320
 one day.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.800
 And then there's going to be the Chris Carter filters here pretty soon from FSS.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.640
 I can't imagine going more than a day without just caving and getting at least the filter.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640
 Yeah and the filter.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640
 You were trying to grab that stuff right off the bed.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.560
 The VCA looked kind of nice too.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.560
 That sounded good.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.760
 Because the only other thing I have is the spectral divisator.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.760
 Which I really love.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.760
 Right.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.560
 But you got like two of them don't you?

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.560
 No no I just have one.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.560
 Okay.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.560
 It's a dual though.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.560
 It is a dual.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.560
 Yeah.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.560
 What do they come out?

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.560
 Get a Dave.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.560
 Get them all.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.560
 They're not right.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.560
 It's expensive.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.960
 But to get all of them is pushing like a thousand I think.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.400
 But that's also a full system.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.960
 Oh it's a full voice.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.960
 Yeah.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.960
 Yeah.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.360
 We should change bad for a thousand bucks and it's got characters.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.360
 They ship November 1st.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.000
 There's a Tg2 generator which looks like a VCO.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.800
 Tg3 filter.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.640
 Tg4 modulator.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.640
 Tg5 pre-amplifier.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:57.360
 200 pounds, 150 pounds for two of them and then 250 for the preamp.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.720
 And those are pounds or the pounds or euros?

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.160
 So that's going to be a lot more than that in the US bucks.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.520
 Actually I have no idea what the conversion rate at this point is.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.480
 Well 200 pounds is 262 US dollars right now.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480
 Wow.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.080
 The whole thing pushes a thousand.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.080
 Which is?

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.480
 No not bad at all.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:27.480
 Wait a minute.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.320
 We have a list.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.320
 Luxious 1.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.320
 Yeah.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.320
 Just talk about that a little.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.560
 So just to reiterate both of you have a Fuxious 1.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.560
 Technically.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.560
 Technically yes.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.560
 We both purchase one.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.200
 Nick does not have one at the moment.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.680
 I just shipped my back.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.680
 Gotcha.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680
 That's right.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.680
 Repairs.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.680
 Day one.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.680
 Yeah.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.680
 Just kind of unfortunate.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.480
 I will say I was using it for like two hours and I was like cool.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.640
 I was getting the hang of it.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:01.040
 There are still some features that aren't implemented yet.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.840
 And I looked up and like half the LEDs weren't lit.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.600
 I was like oh I just thought I was in a weird mode or something.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.080
 Like I'm just still learning this.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.080
 It's complicated.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.080
 Yeah.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.080
 Yeah.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.080
 It's being drunk.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.120
 And I start to realize like I switched the modulator off a few times.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.720
 I'm like no these just aren't lighting up.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.760
 And you go into the one, I think it's the pattern mode or something like they all strobe in

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.760
 colors.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.760
 But I realized even that wasn't triggering them.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.600
 And then I emailed him and I'm like hey running into this issue.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:30.240
 And he's like oh yeah this is one of these must have slipped through.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:35.800
 Oh okay so it was a hardware defect that any are in a replacement.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:41.120
 Yeah it seemed like it was their main defect basically that they were gated by shipping

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.120
 from.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.040
 And a broken LEDs during the manufacturing process.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.920
 So I'm not getting a replacement they're apparently out of replacements but he is going

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.920
 to.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.680
 He's like oh just fix yours and ship it back to you.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.960
 So it's a bummer but in no way a slight on him and what he's doing.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.800
 Yeah and when I was starting to use it and get the hang of it.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.320
 I was like cool I really like using this it's pretty straightforward to put melodies in.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.840
 Like there are some odd things like Greg and I were talking about earlier like using

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.560
 the encoder to do things it would be easier if they were just kind of deep had buttons.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.560
 Yeah yeah okay.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.720
 Yeah I'd be a little straight.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.720
 Yeah.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.720
 Like immediately I feel like playing with it for an hour I was like I'm starting to hate

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.720
 this encoder.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.360
 Like see to navigate through anything you have to push the encoder in.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.440
 Then scroll to the thing you want to change.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.600
 Depress it.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.360
 Then scroll to change it.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.600
 So like that's intense.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.720
 Yeah and there's a lot of stuff in there.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:40.360
 And I kept accidentally scrolling to the wrong thing or forgetting to push it and then I'd

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.680
 scroll on the thing that didn't want to change.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.760
 And I was like this is after an hour this is already pissing me off.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.520
 And I was just thinking to myself like how could this be better?

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.320
 And like in my head like four directional arrows or even just an up down and like an

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:58.480
 enter in the middle or something would be so much easier.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.920
 I don't know if there's a way maybe they can encode it because there is like a page

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.920
 up page down.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.480
 If there's a way like maybe in the code he could change it so that you could ignore the

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.760
 encoder and maybe just use that to navigate and then maybe just push the encoder as an

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.760
 enter.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.840
 It seems like a baffling sort of like design choice.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.040
 Everything else is just like out there laid out pretty thick.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.040
 Exactly.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:23.840
 That's the thing like when you ignore the encoder the rest of the interface is amazing.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.160
 I love the feel of the buttons.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.040
 I love the way everything's laid out.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.360
 I love how the menu system isn't too deep.

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:35.800
 But then you get to that encoder and it just like it like contradicts all of that like

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.120
 good workflow.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.800
 It's like grinding against the rest of that.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:44.480
 And I'm like hopeful that maybe he can get code a different way to navigate it.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.280
 Like an alternate firmware for people who like you who don't want to do it.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.200
 Like alternate but just add like the functions in there.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.600
 Like hold this and press this to move up and down the menu system instead of needing to

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.880
 touch the encoder at all.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.880
 And you don't think you're going to warm up to it.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.160
 There's more stuff getting added to it which means you're going to have to be bouncing around

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.360
 using that encoder even more so you know in the near future.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.280
 But that was my only overall complaint with my time with it.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.000
 I haven't had a chance to dive too deeply into it.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.560
 I mainly was just using it to do some basic sequences and some ARP stuff.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.600
 The ARP engine I think is fantastic.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.600
 Agreed.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.760
 Yeah that was really cool.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.760
 So what does it offer?

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.600
 What's its ARP per step?

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.600
 Yeah.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600
 So like each step can have it work.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600
 So how does it work?

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.600
 ARP-H-G-I.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.280
 Same step sequence you can have 16 different ARP deviations.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.120
 Like if you really wanted to make some complex.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:35.160
 Like I was making with my uh, SIGUTS.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:42.040
 I was programming like a lot of weird like, truly you know C64 ARP sequences with it.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.200
 So I mean how do you give it, do you give it like a chord?

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.200
 Do you give it a direction?

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.400
 Like what is your actual object?

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.400
 Yeah.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.400
 All of it.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.400
 Per step.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.400
 Per step.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.400
 Yeah.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.400
 That's bonkers.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.400
 Yeah.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.280
 You start with step one and you tell it like you know, direction chord all this shit and you

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.280
 tell it how long you want it to be held for.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.920
 So like if you just want that to be four steps you set that to four.0 you know what

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.920
 I mean?

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:07.960
 And then you go to step five and you do like a two step ARP you know.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.640
 And so then you'll go to step six and do like another one.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.640
 Oh yeah.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.640
 You know what I mean?

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.600
 Oh so it's not like you don't have to do it per step though.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.600
 Yeah.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.400
 Give each step its length.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.400
 You know what I mean?

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.640
 And then you have to like oh wow that sounds awesome.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.640
 It is.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.640
 It's pretty awesome.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:27.160
 And that was the main reason that I was interested in this in the first place.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.720
 I was like that is a great feature you know what I mean?

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.720
 And it's awesome.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.560
 And also the modulations.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.280
 Yeah that's a huge feature.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:42.040
 That was the thing I loved most about my sequencer one was that I could create a more complex

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:47.640
 sequence by using the LFOs out and routing them back into itself.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.160
 This can do the same type of thing.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.600
 But currently the LFOs aren't synchronized.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.680
 Which to me is kind of a major downer.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.480
 Do you have a reset though?

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.240
 I mean even if not synchronized can you at least do a hard reset?

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.040
 Yeah I don't think you can at that moment.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.200
 So it's kind of like free form jazzy you know.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.200
 Which isn't me.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.200
 I like being precise and synchronizing everything.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.400
 To the clock you know what I mean?

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.400
 Yeah.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.400
 Yeah.

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.760
 So he said that's going to come in the future.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:23.920
 So it was kind of a bummer that none of the features on the front panel work currently.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.880
 Like everything in gold on there.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.880
 Yeah.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.400
 Except for muting the CV in the gate which are the top two.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.000
 Everything else that's in gold doesn't work yet.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.600
 So you'll slam the shift and hit that and be like it's not doing anything.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:36.600
 Yeah.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.600
 And I had no idea of this.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:42.200
 So I spent like at least a good 45 minutes trying to figure out what the hell I was doing

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.200
 wrong.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.200
 You weren't holding it hard enough.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.200
 Yeah.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.280
 You're missing a key combo is there an option in the menu.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.800
 I went through like every option I was just like no.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.280
 And then Nick told me he's like yeah none of the gold tech stuff works yet.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.280
 I was like what?

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.680
 It's like okay.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.280
 So yeah it's kind of half baked right now.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280
 What's the road map?

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.480
 I mean is this like is he going to be having new stuff on weeks or is it.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.480
 I thought I was going to be out before it shipped.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.480
 Yeah.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.040
 I think that's what he said originally.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.320
 So I have no idea at this point.

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.320
 But I hope it soon.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.480
 Hopefully it doesn't drag on.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:15.520
 Because it sucks to like stare at this panel and say oh yeah this thing is going to do

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.520
 this.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.360
 But just you wait right now it doesn't.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.440
 Yeah it's like it's kind of just like a tease.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.960
 But so far just as a basic sequence there are an ARP engine loving it.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.800
 But yeah I can't wait to see when it reaches its final form.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.800
 Yeah.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.440
 Reaches power level over 9000.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.720
 It's become Star-Sartre again going back to Pokemon.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.080
 But I like the basics of it.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.880
 That's why even when I got it and a couple hours later it wasn't working.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.960
 It was like alright a) I don't really have time to like learn a new sequence or right

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:50.040
 now I'm trying to make a bunch of stuff and that this will distract me for weeks.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.600
 And b) it was like the basic stuff was really straightforward and quick to get sequences

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.600
 going.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.000
 So that's what I wanted it for.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.520
 I love the colors too.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.160
 The screen, the colors, the buttons.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.160
 The buttons.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.160
 Very nice.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.160
 Yeah.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.280
 Even if someone who like just hates colorful things and anything that isn't just gray or

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.080
 black even I was like warmed over by it.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.880
 It just looks like something you use the pilot like an alien craft.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.880
 Yeah.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.880
 You know what I mean?

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.880
 It's so compact too.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.880
 Yeah.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:23.280
 For a sequencer people tend to make these big fucking modules for sequencers but the thing

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.200
 it's got it all and it's compact as hell.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.800
 And the jack-a-lay out looks sensible like it doesn't look too cramped.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.000
 I mean you're probably not going to have a ton of stack cables.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.800
 There's four channels and ins and outs.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.800
 Yeah.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.360
 It's all there in that little package.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.200
 It's pretty sweet.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.080
 And it's well made too when I got it.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.960
 I'm like alright he put a lot of detail into the mechanical construction of it.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.720
 It doesn't feel like a shitty like it was put together poorly.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.720
 Great.

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.920
 I had some LED defects but you know it's manufactured.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.920
 Yeah.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.760
 Again though I do want to complain about the encoder.

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.560
 Like not just the use of it but the feel of it.

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.840
 The encoder to me feels cheap compared to everything else.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.680
 Like the button on it and just like the movement of it.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:09.240
 Like in comparison like the 352 the encoder on that thing feels rock solid.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.800
 Yeah it's a nice knob.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.600
 You know that feels like a nice encoder.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.560
 The flexor one just feels like I could snap that encoder off.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.560
 I agree with that.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.960
 I'd like the thumb indent on the 352 also.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.960
 I love that too.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.320
 Yeah I feel like what is it?

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.320
 What are you talking about?

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.320
 Feel it dude.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.320
 Alright let me go feel this.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.520
 It's got a thumb groove on the encoder.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.520
 It's fantastic.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.520
 Yeah.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.520
 We're here.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.520
 Wait what the fuck is that?

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.520
 Yeah it's nice dude.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.520
 That is nice.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.080
 It's right there.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.720
 Now feel the flexor encoder.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.000
 Oh god yeah I know.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.200
 I don't want to know.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.680
 I've never felt something.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.680
 That's what I'm saying.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.160
 Yeah that's surprisingly flimsy.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:48:08.140
 I'm just gonna get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:28.500
 What are you doing with my cartons?

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.700
 Why are they taped to the walls?

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.260
 Making a new video moon.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.020
 Me long.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.260
 (laughing)
