WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:29.760
 - I just wanted to say I appreciate you guys recording

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.400
 later than usual,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.400
 accommodating my cello recital.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.720
 It went very well.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.080
 - Better.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.080
 - It was a lego-moderato by Johann Sebastian Bach.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.000
 Not to be confused with Sebastian Bach from Skid Row.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.640
 I did not cover a Skid Row.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.040
 - Dave doesn't tell us about his recitals

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.680
 'cause he doesn't want us to go.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.320
 - That is exactly why I don't tell you about them

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.520
 until after them, in which case it's too late for you to go.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 - 'Cause I would get.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.880
 I'd check it out, dude.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.720
 - That's a problem.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.320
 I appreciate everyone being very supportive of it,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.080
 but I like that I don't know anyone there,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.120
 and it makes it easier to do.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.480
 If there were people there that I knew,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.440
 I'd just fuck up a lot.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.040
 That's why we wanna go.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.880
 - Yeah.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.040
 (laughs)

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.120
 - And every time you fuck up,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.760
 I'm gonna slap the fingers with that.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.760
 (laughs)

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.920
 - Just start laughing and throwing shit.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.760
 - Start over!

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.920
 (laughs)

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.240
 - Ooh!

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.520
 That was a sour one.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.680
 (laughs)

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.120
 A little flat there, Dave.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.760
 (laughs)

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.040
 - This is exactly why he doesn't tell us.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.840
 So how are you feeling about your cello progress?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.760
 - I'm feeling pretty good.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.440
 It's been a little over five years now,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.280
 and like, it's been that fucking long.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.600
 - Yeah.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.400
 - And my teacher has a couple of younger kids.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 I don't know how old they are,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 and they're like struggling with the stuff

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.920
 that like when I first started out,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.280
 and I'm like, oh man, it's so cool to see

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.200
 like kids failing at something

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.200
 as a reminder that I'm not that anymore.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.040
 - Right.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.680
 - Which is a little fucked up now that I say it all out.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.520
 (laughs)

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.800
 - It's a measurement of progress.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.640
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.640
 - I'm using a child's suffering

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.160
 as a metric for my own successes.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.760
 - Even better.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.640
 - So episode 16.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.800
 Is that what this is?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.640
 That's what this is.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.080
 Sweet 16.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.320
 We didn't do a whole lot of episodes this year.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.160
 - Yeah.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.120
 - I think we did like five.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.160
 I think this is like the fifth episode of the year,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.520
 if I recall, something like that.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.760
 - I mean, we said upfront that this was not gonna be

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.600
 a regular podcast.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.080
 - Right, I'm just comparing to previous.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.920
 - Yeah.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.440
 - Been a little spread out.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.440
 - I think we were doing a good job of,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.760
 you know, making sure there's enough to talk about each time.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.480
 By like, you know, holding off.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.200
 Or was it a bad year for music here?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.720
 - Ooh, uh oh.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.880
 - Good segue into the topic for this.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.080
 Should we insert some sort of like,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.320
 catchy, swooshy, exciting, like newsreel,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.720
 bumper sound right here?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.760
 Like, whoosh, don't don't.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.040
 Year in review.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.120
 - 2018 year in review.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.280
 - Awful year.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.600
 - Well, my notes for this cap are,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.240
 I got a lot of posy stuff on this.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.040
 - Good.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.560
 - I don't think it was a jerk balance out my shit talking.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.720
 I did go back into time.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.840
 I went back to episode 11.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.760
 - R 2017 in review.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.040
 - Wait, did you just go and listen to that episode?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.840
 Or did you actually go back in time?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.640
 - I went back in time.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.160
 - So like you were in the room

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.400
 when we recorded that in person.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.080
 I was there as a hologram and I recorded it

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.400
 and then I came back to the present

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.200
 and I realized we already had a recording of it.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.040
 - Oh, yeah.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.760
 - And I thought I'd just listen to it on SoundCloud.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.360
 But in episode 11, during our 2017 review,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.720
 there was a couple things discussed

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.160
 of what we wanted to see in 2018.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.520
 And some of those things actually came true.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.120
 - Wow, like what?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.040
 - You said you wanted the gristleizer to come out.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.880
 - And it did.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.320
 And you said you wanted that sonic terror in a module.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.160
 - And it was.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.000
 - And it was.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.760
 We said we wanted to see more processing,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.120
 especially granular processing,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.480
 more possibly a blown out version of clouds

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.000
 or a high fidelity granular processing.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.880
 Both things now exist.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.720
 - It's true.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.360
 - We got the Nebula 2, which came out this year,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.760
 which is essentially higher quality version of clouds.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.560
 And there's the grayscale.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.400
 - Supercell?

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.240
 - Yes, thank you.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.080
 Supercell.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.280
 Which literally is clouds with everything blown out,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.520
 brought to the forefront the whole nine yards.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.640
 It's like three times the size of the original clouds

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.920
 and the whole nine yards.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.800
 It's big and it's got all the blend modes on the panel.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.680
 They all have individual CVs and a bunch of other stuff.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.520
 It's pretty cool.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.960
 I'm like real on the fence with getting one.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.560
 Like I still have the U-grids or U-burst rather.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.560
 - Yeah.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.200
 - I got the parasite firmware on there.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.680
 That's like the only thing that I'm holding back

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.800
 on getting one of these is 'cause currently

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.560
 it's just a factory firmware.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.400
 - Oh, yeah.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.040
 - If they release a version that is like

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.000
 capable of running parasite,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.760
 that'd be all over it.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.720
 When it's back in stock,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.080
 it sold out like immediately.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.920
 - Yeah.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.760
 - Yeah.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.600
 I don't wanna get too off track,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.520
 but just figure out talk about that a little bit.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.560
 You can't get like the original clouds anymore.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.400
 You know what I mean?

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.240
 Unless you get it like second hand,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.360
 like that got discontinued in 2017.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.680
 So it's kind of cool that they came,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.840
 somebody came up with a better version.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.280
 Although he's been kind of teasing a little bit

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.920
 that there's another one coming.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.400
 But it's gonna be a simpler granular processor.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.240
 - Yeah.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.080
 - Some sort of work.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.080
 - Oh, mutable does?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.920
 - Yeah.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.760
 - Yeah.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.920
 That's another thing we were talking about.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.000
 And we were hoping that maybe that would come out.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.360
 Like Mark II, no dice on that though.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.880
 But in the meantime,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.640
 there's Nebula and Supercell I guess

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.960
 to keep people busy with their granular mangling.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.600
 - And the marbles, which is pretty cool.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.080
 - Well, granted not granular at all,

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.720
 but a good release from you.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.240
 - I just thought it was cool that

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.680
 that's exactly what we discussed at the end of the year.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.520
 - Yeah.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.560
 Do we have any wants or asks that didn't come true

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.560
 or were flops or wildly off the rails?

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.960
 - We speculated that 2018 would be the year of the Omnimod,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.600
 which was partially true.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.440
 - It's partially true.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.960
 - It did come out and it did start shipping,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.520
 but it seems kind of like a flop.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.760
 Like not many people seem to be raving about it.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.600
 You know what I mean?

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.920
 It didn't seem like a wild success.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.040
 There's no second batch being talked about.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.600
 It's kind of like,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.840
 it seemed like it shipped out and just kind of died down.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.560
 - Now, how much of that may have just been

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.000
 all of the meta aspect of the Omnimod?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.040
 Like it shows up at your door and you're like,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.360
 I don't even want to fucking look at you.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.920
 - Well, another thing we said,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.080
 was maybe somebody will create something

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.360
 that's an Omnimod, but not an Omnimod.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.200
 - Oh shit.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.560
 - And lo and behold, Zadar came out.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.400
 - Yep.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.960
 - And I think it kind of took it,

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.840
 you know, the bull by the horns there.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.000
 Anyone that was hyped for, I think, Omnimod

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.160
 or a second batch, I think kind of just jumped

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.080
 on the Zadar train.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.920
 Like it's kind of impossible to get right now.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.760
 - Yeah.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.360
 - My first note is Zadar module of the year.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.240
 - I wrote that down to you.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.080
 - Yeah.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.120
 - I wrote MVM.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.560
 - Oh, most valued module.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.480
 - Slash Zadar.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.320
 - Yeah.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.520
 - That thread is just people talking about

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.000
 how they can't make them fast enough.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.840
 - Yeah.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.480
 - Which is an awesome problem to have,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.600
 but also kind of a bummer.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.440
 - Yeah.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.520
 It's not even told January for the next batch,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.840
 which is probably mostly spoken for.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.640
 - Right, right.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.080
 I wonder if they just didn't realize

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.080
 that it would be such a success

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.520
 or if they just have to like scale production.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.320
 So that's two votes for module of the year.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.160
 Do you know what I mean?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.000
 - Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.840
 - No question.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.680
 - No question.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.520
 - I don't even know.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.040
 What would even be the runner up?

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.960
 - Yeah.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.800
 - Yeah.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.640
 - I don't know.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.920
 - I mean, for me, the aforementioned gristleizer.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.760
 - Yeah.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.560
 - That's my runner up.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.240
 - That's your personal second favorite of the year.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.080
 - Yeah.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.200
 And then my third is a graphic VCO.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.040
 - Okay.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.080
 - I had my top three listed out there and nice.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.920
 Yeah.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.760
 Those are mine.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.600
 - I've got my own personal.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.520
 I would say easily Zadar without question,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.920
 but a twin peak, epoch modular twin peak.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.040
 Favorite filter ever.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.920
 - I absolutely love it.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.880
 It's the juice, man.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.880
 It's the shit.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.960
 It's just, I don't know, something about it.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.280
 Really like it.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.160
 - Did you replace any filters with that one?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.560
 Or it just?

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.560
 - Yes.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.400
 Polaris.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.240
 - Yeah.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.920
 - Then replace the Polaris in case actually.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.800
 And I'm pretty stoked about it.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.360
 'Cause it's a weird thing.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.040
 It's like two filters, but the way,

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.600
 instead of making a band pass filter,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.680
 you wanna kind of always guarantee

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.680
 that there's some space in the middle.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.760
 Otherwise you're gonna have silence

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.760
 or it's gonna cross over it.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.920
 You would have these weird dead spots.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.160
 So his design was to take the flip of it

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.800
 and to kind of use that.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.000
 The absolute invert of that

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.320
 and to kind of map it against that.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.840
 So there's always this guaranteed space.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.400
 I can't explain it as well.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.680
 It's really hard to see until you visualize it.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.680
 But it's really the resonance.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.320
 As far as filters where you ping them

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.560
 and they make a cool sound

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.600
 and you can make stuff out of it,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.760
 it's the best one I've ever seen by far.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.160
 I've had QMMG, some other things that were really good at pinging.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.240
 This is kind of the God for that in my mind.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.240
 Turn the frequency down and it's like bass drop.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.600
 So you ping it super fast

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.840
 and it's just very high definition kind of like pinging sounds.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.840
 On top of being an awesome filter.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.920
 So I'm using it all over the place.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.920
 Nice. Yeah.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.040
 Excellent design.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.240
 Really digging it.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.880
 Do you have a top three?

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.720
 It's number three.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.320
 You've only done two.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.160
 I did three.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.720
 I'm not trying to brag, but I did three.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.920
 You've only done two.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.680
 You would have to steal on that for a minute.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.680
 Well, some of us were prepared and some of us were not prepared.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.160
 Fuck.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.120
 Probably memetic digitalis.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.880
 Hmm. OK.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.960
 OK.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.600
 Do we, I mean, have we gone in depth on that in these episodes yet?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.240
 I know you've had it for a minute.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.960
 I don't know if we've done a deep dive on it.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.720
 I don't know if we've talked about it all that much.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.760
 I don't remember. A little bit.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.040
 A little bit. Yeah.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.000
 It's like a mini Renee.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.480
 I remember you saying you really thought you were.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.280
 Yeah. I was like,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.800
 so I've had some realizations lately

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.000
 that I don't like sequencers as much within my modular,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.600
 especially if they're doing no work,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.760
 because I like to do that in other sequencers.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.480
 But I've learned that the memetic,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.080
 it's probably my favorite, like, parameter sequencer of, like,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.600
 just like, I want to fuck up like a delay line or just like,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.640
 and do something like that.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.000
 Like, I like that one because you can do the parameter walk

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.160
 or like the really clever, like, kind of stop it

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.240
 and just like change a few notes, like,

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.920
 and you get four of them and it's pretty small.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.040
 So, and like we were talking about earlier,

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.800
 like the ability to like, see via, like hit those triggers

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.160
 and like, nudge the sequence in a repeatable way to the point

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.400
 where even when you take the voltage away,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.720
 it's like dead on where it should be in the sequence of music,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.120
 which we've talked about a little before on a previous podcast,

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.120
 but that kind of like, the design, they kind of nailed it

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.160
 and that kind of wins it, wins it for me.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.960
 I would say that's my third for sure.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.000
 Nice. So, wait, did you give three?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 I did not.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.840
 All right, what's your throw?

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.400
 Did you write down three or are you going to do this off the top of your hat?

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.440
 No, I know it.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.240
 Off the day. You know it? Yeah, yeah.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.440
 Well, number one was the zider.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.840
 Number two was the marbles,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.960
 mutable and shot of marbles. Oh, yeah.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.160
 Even though I just got that very recently at the end of 2018,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.480
 I feel like it changed the game for me.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.880
 So talented. Yeah.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.760
 And it came out middle of the year, you know what I mean?

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.520
 But I didn't really pay a whole lot of attention to it until just recently.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.040
 I was like, damn, yeah, kind of slept on it.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.240
 Kind of regret doing that.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.760
 Can you give it like a brief overview of like,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.600
 you mentioned something about this being the touring plus woggle bug?

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.320
 Yeah, that's the best way I can describe it.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.120
 You know, it's a pretty deep module.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.720
 It's kind of hard to talk about everything that it can do

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.440
 without like comparing it to things that existed before.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.840
 You know, I mean, the best way I can describe it is like a touring machine

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.520
 meets a woggle bug, shift register, you know, randomization,

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.920
 gate output, but at the same time,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:59.280
 outputs multiple CVs that are based on the timing of those gates.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:08.040
 The clocks, I should say, it's an all-in-one modulation random orgy of functionality.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.960
 You know, I really dug the woggle bug.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.000
 I've had one in my rack for almost a decade.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.040
 I feel like you always got to have that element of randomness,

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.280
 you know, even chaos and a modular setup.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.960
 And I think Marvel's kind of nails it.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.760
 Takes it to the next level,

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.680
 the ability to lock it and CV it and control the amount of randomness

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:36.080
 that you want can get pretty intense or just very subtle with the generation

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.720
 or generative patching.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.800
 Number three, I think, would probably be the Erika Drum Sequencer.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.120
 Yeah, I'll stick with that.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.480
 OK, that's a good answer.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.680
 I was going to say overstayer, but that's not a module.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.520
 No.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.280
 Well, I guess we're not restricting our conversations to modules ever.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.080
 So OK, yeah, you know, I take that back.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.960
 I like the drum sequencer.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.480
 But it didn't change my game.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.240
 You know what I mean?

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.080
 Yeah, I know.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.560
 Like it just replaced other sequencers that I was already using to do the same job.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.760
 I just like it better.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.920
 Whereas the overstayer, like that, you know, that flipped the script for me.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.040
 And overstayer modular channel.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.280
 I guess I should be more specific.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:24.040
 I find a lot of the source modules that I've obsessively collected over the years

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.840
 when I'm collecting dust because I just route everything through the overstayer more than anything.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.640
 Have you made new discoveries since the last--

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.360
 because you talked about length the last time.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.280
 What have you discovered since then?

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.200
 With the overstayer?

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.480
 I'm constantly finding new shit with it.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.280
 Lately, I've been doing weird things where I'll disable the compression circuit

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.600
 and I'll take the inputs way down and just kind of like give it room to breathe

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.880
 and then boost everything up like using other stages for gain-stating.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.840
 The EQ, for example, you know what I mean?

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.760
 Things like that.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.960
 Driving it with the filters, just driving things in different ways.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.880
 Just finding ways where less is more.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.000
 Your first demo that you gave to us, everything, was Crank to 11.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.760
 And it sounded amazing.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.360
 Yeah.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.680
 But yeah, just finding like nuances between the different circuits

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.800
 by giving them headroom has been a lot of fun lately.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.280
 If I'm not mistaken, you're principally using it for drums.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.080
 Have you been using it with other stuff as well?

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.680
 Yeah.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.880
 I've been routing sub-nixes through it.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.200
 Atmospheric stuff to give things like texture.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.160
 I've been sending everything through it.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.800
 That's what's been leading to different levels of experimentation

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.560
 with it finding out where I like sweet spots for certain things.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.720
 So far, it's been able to handle anything I've thrown at it.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.000
 That's awesome.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.840
 I had a second note here.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.120
 I don't know if we touched on this on 2017 or ever in the past,

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.840
 or if this was just something that was kind of in my brain.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.920
 But I have the note here that people are still coming up

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.560
 with cool new ideas.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.120
 They're getting fewer and far between.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.560
 They are.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.960
 But they still exist.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.600
 It doesn't seem like it's gone completely dry.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.040
 It does feel like 2018 was peak, your Iraq.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.480
 As far as popularity goes and people put things up,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.320
 but at the same time, there was so much different variations

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.240
 of things that heard you exist.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.640
 There was very few--

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.200
 I'm arguing that those gems are enough to go,

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.000
 but there are still some cool ideas left to still have.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.400
 And we're not just gone into a rut of coffee-cats around.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.200
 It's such a high level now, too.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.200
 I think before it was like, oh, this exists.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.640
 Well, now it's like, oh, but I've made a better one now.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.240
 People are one-upping each other.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.600
 And I think it's like the quality of modules

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.720
 seems to be higher, too.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.840
 Digital oscillators are way better than they were before.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.080
 I think it's kind of getting to the--

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.320
 I don't know, the state of the art's

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.840
 pretty interesting now compared to where it was, where it was just

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.960
 like, oh, somebody made this thing that was like a surge,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.120
 or a blue light now.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.240
 It's like another level, which is really cool to see.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.840
 Yeah, so one of the things I've drawn it down to,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.520
 it was hopeful to see in 2019 is more crazy digital shit.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.840
 I'm tired of just seeing the same analog circuits being

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.240
 redone in slightly different ways,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.560
 or that just being the selling points.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.920
 Oh, it's analog.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.840
 I still kind of feel that way about what

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.320
 was it, the endorphins--

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.200
 Oh, the black noir.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.480
 Interesting concept, but the sound did not really sound much

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.320
 different than any of the other analog drum circuits

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.600
 that you could get out there.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.280
 I was like, if they would have went a digital route,

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.080
 and you could have programmed different drum voices,

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.960
 and then have snapshots of them that you could recall,

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.840
 I want to see a module like that.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.320
 Not another analog, want to be 808 or whatever.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.080
 There's enough modules out there that can make techno.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.800
 I mean, processing power and everything,

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.440
 you're saying the quality of stuff coming out right now

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.440
 has never been higher.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.760
 But I think there's hopefully someone out there

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.120
 designing some really crazy digital stuff that

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.600
 utilizes the processing power that we can squeeze into a tiny

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.760
 module now.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.360
 Just take things to the next level.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.440
 Or even something novel, like just even the idea of the Zadar

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.840
 and using the vectors.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.040
 Yeah, Zadar is a great example.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.240
 I want to see more--

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:16.920
 Same here.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.480
 Yeah, exactly.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.000
 I want more things with the recallable presets too.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.520
 Exactly.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.200
 I love that more and more now.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.600
 It's like I'm just kind of goal to be able to go back to at least

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.960
 most of the sound.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.320
 I want to see that, and I want to see the ability to CV

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.720
 between modules that can utilize snapshots for--

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.880
 Exactly.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.120
 And then you're kind of getting into the territory of like,

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.600
 oh, it's just preset machine.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.120
 You know what I mean?

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.880
 But it doesn't have to be that way.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.680
 Yeah, Bucla 200E stuff was like that too.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.440
 That was the whole point of the E. And they think they got

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.720
 something pretty good back then.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.360
 Or at least we're close to a really good idea.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.240
 A snapshot is different than a preset.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.840
 Because like going back to the graphic VCO,

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.840
 I've got a ton of snapshots now.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.760
 But I put a pretty good amount of effort in each one of those.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.200
 Those are going to be like, no one else is going to want them.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.120
 They sound like hell.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:05.640
 Yeah.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.640
 You're still going to patch it.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.840
 You're still going to do a million things to get it to do something.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.480
 And actually in the graphic VCO, there was no snapshots that came with it.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:14.960
 Nice.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.480
 Yeah.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.320
 It really was like--

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:16.840
 So blank.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.320
 --this is all you--

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:17.840
 Yeah.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.840
 --it's all the user-manics.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.160
 --of the chance of such stuff.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.840
 I dig that.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.240
 Yeah, same here.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:31.360
 I'm pretty sure early 2019, we're supposed to see Hertz donut Mark 3

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.000
 from Industrial Music Electronics, AKA Harvest Man.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.400
 And I'm pretty sure he has a preset system in that,

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.280
 where you can save your stuff and then recall it.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.840
 And I think you can even see between it.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.760
 And I'm like, hell yeah.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.840
 That's what I'm talking about.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.760
 That's the type of stuff I want to see in 2019.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.520
 I want to see a drum voice like that.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.240
 You know what I mean?

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.600
 An all-in-one, maybe four-channel drum machine

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.280
 where you can program each drum the way you want, take a snapshot.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.600
 And then CV between that.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.760
 You know what I mean?

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.240
 Yeah.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.160
 I don't know.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.880
 If you see all the stuff I have jotted down

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.920
 that I was really hopeful for next year.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.800
 I don't want to--

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.800
 I don't know.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.160
 It's hard to make a prediction this year, I think.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.160
 You know what I mean?

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.160
 Yeah.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.440
 Like, there was a lot of stuff that

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.720
 was on the horizon at the end of 2017, rolling end of 2018.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.960
 Right now, I'm not so much.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.480
 You know what I mean?

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.760
 A lot of stuff came out that was either good

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.760
 or got largely ignored.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.400
 You know what I mean?

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.720
 Just like, not a whole lot on the horizon

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.960
 that I'm like super stoked for or anything.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.600
 Well, I've got a twist on that.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.800
 Actually, I have a counter-argument to that.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.480
 Because one of my notes is, I feel like 2018

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.760
 is the calm before the storm for the next wave of video shit.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.640
 OK.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.440
 So specifically, I'm talking about the structure,

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.920
 which we've talked about in the past.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.080
 The promise of structure is pretty high.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.840
 And all the new LZX series of video processing.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.400
 I didn't know there was a new series coming.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.400
 Yeah.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.440
 It's Memory Palace is one of them.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.560
 There's a couple other ones that are up on our site.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.040
 And Lars kind of touched on them briefly at NOPKON.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.760
 But it does seem like that next step in what you can do with video.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.880
 And this may not be correct.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.680
 I may be wrong in this prediction or this hope.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.880
 But mid-2019.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.440
 When you see a video modular performance,

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.160
 it could be completely different than what you expect to see now.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.960
 I mean, there's evidence to support that, man.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.040
 I mean, NOPKON alone.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.320
 Like we saw so many different video stuff more

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.040
 so than any other year previously.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.240
 And I am hyped for structure, for sure.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.320
 It's just at a point where we've been watching that evolve

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.200
 for three or four years now.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.920
 I'm kind of-- it's just like on the back burner for me.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.400
 When it comes out, I'm going to be super hyped and jump on it.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.160
 But in the meantime, I'm just trying to put it out of my brain.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.440
 If they all converge to come out in January,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.720
 I mean, it would just be like--

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.520
 Flipping the script.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.080
 It would flip the script in a pretty short amount of time.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.120
 I'll be curious to see if in the next year--

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.680
 so for live performance, modular got to a certain level

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.320
 of exposure, I feel, where I was like, oh, almost like--

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.600
 a lot of people are playing live with modulars

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.800
 or the whole YouTube channel modular performance thing

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.080
 became almost a meme in its own right.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.880
 And I'll be curious to see if people still

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.880
 stick with using modulars to make music

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.600
 or if that becomes like just--

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.080
 like it was a fad that became popular as like all the stuff

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.640
 crested probably somewhere like a little bit of both,

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.200
 I would think.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.360
 But I'll be curious to see like how much it still sticks around

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.840
 in the next couple of years or if it just becomes this like

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.360
 curiosity and people shift over to like, oh, I just

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.720
 use like a profit X in this drum machine that's new or something.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.240
 You know?

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.000
 I don't know.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.120
 Everyone does shit differently.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.720
 But they did become a little more popular to see people

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.080
 playing with a modular live.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.640
 I feel like there's this other sector entirely of like people

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:04.280
 making these like really beautifully shot,

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.280
 like the video is beautiful and it's really nice ambient,

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.920
 like high texture stuff.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.040
 And when I first started discovering this and like,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.520
 listen to them like, this is great.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.120
 And then I realized like six months later,

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.400
 I'm like, I kind of indistinguishable.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:18.920
 Yeah.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.840
 This has almost become like a cliche in like a matter of like

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.520
 six months.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.960
 It would be kind of cool if there was an evolution of that.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.240
 Like taking that idea and going like, OK,

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.000
 I spent a week on this patch and I'm

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.280
 going to make this a beautiful presentation.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.320
 But it doesn't have to just be this like really soft ambient.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.080
 It brings the clouds kind of thing.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.360
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.280
 I was just going to say that is part of the biggest part

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.800
 of why I slept on marbles from those part of this year.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:48.880
 Because I've gotten so numb to like,

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.600
 people just taking any combination of mutable instrument

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:57.040
 stuff and making the same exact sounding thing with it

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.920
 and putting it on YouTube.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.880
 It's real nice.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.880
 Like I'm very pretty.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.880
 It's very pretty.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.280
 It's very good.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.280
 It is just--

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.280
 I am.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.040
 I'm not sure.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.880
 I'm not sure you got it in the sense of like,

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.920
 it doesn't sound bad or like it's not like,

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.680
 like people are not phoning it in.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.120
 These aren't, this is people putting time in,

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.720
 putting thought into it.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.640
 It's just, it's been done to death.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.320
 And I thought Magneto was another one

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.320
 that got that ended up going this route.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:21.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.160
 Magneto's lumped in there a lot.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.680
 Yeah.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.480
 It's kind of the sound.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.000
 Yeah.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.400
 But you will see clouds, you'll see rings,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.160
 you'll see marbles, you'll see plats,

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.640
 and you'll see Magneto all in the same setup constantly.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.480
 Oh, and elements.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.320
 You know what I mean?

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.440
 It's like always the same combo of stuff

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.680
 and trying to make the same sound.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.640
 Like I love mutable instruments to stuff.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.280
 But like that whole mindset that that's

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.920
 what you're supposed to do with his stuff,

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.440
 kind of like turn me off to it for a while.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.080
 You know?

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:52.840
 And I started like--

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.200
 And it was hard to figure out that it

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.880
 was capable of doing anything else.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.360
 Right.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.320
 Because that's all you saw for--

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:58.840
 Yes.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.200
 Honestly, to this day, for a lot, like elements,

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.640
 it's pretty hard to find anything that isn't.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.480
 It's like a really lovely ambient.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:05.840
 Yeah.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.000
 You type in YouTube like any mutable module,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.120
 and that's what you're going to find.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.720
 It's really hard to find a demo that isn't that.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.080
 Right.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.240
 And for a minute, I didn't know what the home marvels actually

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:17.680
 did.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.280
 You know what I mean?

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.360
 Like anything that I pulled up in YouTube was just that.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:21.720
 You know?

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.080
 Yes.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.280
 I can't tell them apart.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:25.800
 Right.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.280
 You know?

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.760
 It's like I want to hear somebody making something unique

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.520
 with this stuff.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.600
 Like it's more than capable than just the rings

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.680
 through clouds sound.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.320
 Like it's-- there's more that you can do with it.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.880
 At the same time, I don't want to sound like I'm talking shit.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.400
 You know what I mean?

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.680
 Yeah.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.840
 I like to find the ugly side of things.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.640
 You know what I mean?

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:46.840
 Yeah.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.400
 And it was just something different.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.200
 I mean, they're really indistinguishable.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.760
 And I was just thinking of someone

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.040
 like at a table with a cactus and this pretty modular,

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.240
 but they're just fucking sobbing at the table

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.200
 when it's just this horrible, harsh noise just like,

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:06.080
 rrr, rrr, rrr, and then just go, God, they didn't say it would do this, too.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.000
 It's fucking tears.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.640
 I don't subscribe to YouTube channels.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.440
 That would be my first subscription.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.760
 I just pound that subscribe button.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.360
 Crying into my rings.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.880
 Oh, God.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.720
 I mean, but we are missing an opportunity, though.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.200
 Because we could-- we could actually have like a yoga class

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:35.240
 where we have all of these, I mean, basically new age sounding sounds.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.520
 Modules are the new avocado toast.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.680
 This is how I'm just allowing me for a lovely brunch

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.360
 and listen to my new mutable instruments patch.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.600
 I just keep thinking of the companion polar opposite channel now,

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.360
 where it's like someone comes along, everyone's along,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.000
 just whips the shit out of my person.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.800
 Programming a modular.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.800
 Fuck, fuck.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.040
 Fuck that thing one more time.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.040
 Do it.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.720
 Fuckin' dare you.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.120
 That's where our brains live.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:05.480
 Yeah.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:05.920
 The gutter.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.400
 Yeah.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.840
 One might say, in the dumpster.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.760
 See?

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.800
 I had to do it.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:15.640
 You didn't have to do it.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.760
 No, you could have stopped.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.240
 That's good.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.960
 You had the power to stop.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.600
 I'm glad you didn't stop.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.280
 I do kind of want an element still there.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.280
 Yeah.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.120
 I've always, always lost you.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.320
 I got it again for the third time.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.080
 Third, yeah.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.640
 That's it.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.760
 This is it though.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.440
 I mean, you've gotten this.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.680
 I'm keeping it, yeah.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.720
 I've realized it is what it is, and I like it.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.880
 You know what I mean?

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.560
 Last time I resold it because I thought, oh,

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.760
 Plonk had replaced this.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.520
 Oh, that's right.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.320
 Plonk is completely different.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.000
 And gone.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:46.920
 You don't even have one.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.800
 Oh, I do.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.680
 Wait, where's your plonk?

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.720
 It's sitting over there waiting to be sold.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.000
 Oh, wait.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:51.800
 I did sell it.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.280
 No, I shipped it out two days ago.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:53.720
 You're right.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.840
 Yeah, it's gone.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.200
 I forgot.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.440
 It sold within minutes, and we put it up on reverb.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:58.760
 I mean, you--

00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.680
 That's why I forgot.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.600
 You having it out of your case and sitting over there

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.160
 waiting to be sold would not actually count as you having it

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:04.840
 anymore.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.360
 Yeah.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.600
 That's like limbo over there.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.640
 Like, I did everything over my long weekend.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.400
 Like, I took every module out, put them back in and away.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.360
 I wanted stuff that I realized I hadn't been using that much.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.280
 I just put over there.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.480
 And I was like, I'll think about selling this or what.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.680
 But yeah, I mean, plonk is interesting,

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.680
 but I just had a couple of problems with it in the mix.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.160
 You know what I mean?

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.400
 It has like a unique sound, and it's

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.200
 hard to make it jive with other things, in my opinion.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.560
 And as far as physical modeling goes,

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.760
 I still like elements.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.960
 And like, Rainmaker has like a processor and all that.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.960
 Like, the plonk, which is kind of like, mm.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.320
 Yeah.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.760
 It wasn't doing a whole lot with it.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.320
 So off it goes.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.320
 Funny story about that, elements.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:59.560
 That was the filthiest module that I've ever received from somebody.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.800
 Do you want to name names?

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.080
 I don't want to name names.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.120
 They know who the fuck they are.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.040
 You know what they did.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.520
 They know what they did.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.200
 I got the package, and I opened it up,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.000
 and it was one of those things where like, you're not even

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.720
 through the bubble wrap yet, but you smell it.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.240
 Yeah.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.320
 And I was like, hmm, I think this guy might be a smoker.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.600
 I couldn't tell if it was smoke or dirt,

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.120
 but it definitely was like an aroma came out of the box.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.280
 And I was like, hmm, boy.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:31.000
 And I unwrapped it and like, you know how like you run your finger

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.400
 along the mantle.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:32.800
 You know?

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.520
 And it's just like gritty.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.320
 You got that dust on your finger.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.760
 The whole panel was like that, dude.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.880
 Oh, that's terrible.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.520
 So I immediately just put it down.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.800
 And I got the pliers, and I pulled every knob off it.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.480
 I threw every knob because they were filthy.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.200
 Into a little Tupperware thing full of rubbing alcohol.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.600
 Let it soak for like a minute, and then I rinsed them all off

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.240
 and dried them out.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:02.000
 And then I took Q-tips and alcohol swabs

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 and just cleaned the fuck out of the panel as best I could.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.560
 There was still some grime around like the little nuts

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.360
 and whatnot, and the little plastic knobs on there

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.400
 that I couldn't get fully cleaned.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.000
 I didn't want to pull the whole panel off.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.520
 Sure.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.680
 But I was tempted to.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.480
 I was just going to take the whole panel off

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.520
 and just give that thing a scrub like alone.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.360
 But yeah, that was pretty grimy.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.640
 But yeah, that was just annoying.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.840
 I don't have much on the horizon.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.520
 I got that plat because I could swap that out.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.840
 But I kind of know what to expect there.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.200
 I know what I'm getting there.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.600
 There's nothing else that I'm really looking for.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.760
 Well, I mean, if that's the case for the next couple episodes,

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.760
 maybe we can do some demos.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.080
 We've only done demo in a while.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.080
 Deep dives, demos.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.280
 Let's get some deep dives.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.160
 Maybe we can ask the readers or listeners.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.000
 We could ask the listeners.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.080
 What would you like us to deep dive?

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.080
 Maybe it's something we hadn't thought of with people.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.040
 Oh, you talked about this, but you only glossed over it.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.160
 And they want us to sink our teeth into it.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.280
 Listeners?

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.080
 We're open to suggestions.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.480
 I don't know how they get a hold of us.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.000
 I think we have a Gmail account that--

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.400
 Do we?

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:11.880
 Yeah.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.080
 Yeah, we've had one for a while.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.320
 I mean, I've seen people leave comments on SoundCloud.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:15.820
 Yeah.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.400
 I'm hearing there.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.080
 Hopefully they're not-- like, hopefully the inbox in our Gmail

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.840
 account is in, like, 1,000 feet.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.760
 Like, why won't you get a hold of me?

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.440
 I can't remember the last one I checked it.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.840
 Yeah, me neither.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.320
 Oh, this is a weird idea.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.120
 I just thought up to--

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.760
 maybe one episode we could all do, like, a 10-minute set.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.120
 Oh.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.280
 Or like, just a patch.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.560
 Just like, make a patch and then explain it.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.520
 Maybe like, go over what it is.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.880
 And I mean, now that I have this case,

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.560
 I can fucking bring it over here and play it.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.720
 Like, we could do something.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.320
 Or yeah, even play it and then talk about it or something.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.480
 Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.000
 I've never thought about that before.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 Yeah.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.280
 Might be cool.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.720
 I mean, if it sucks, we'll just stop doing it.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.200
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:27.040
 Yeah, that one labeled "Facos" always cracking the whip,

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.080
 dude.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.160
 Yeah, but I mean, like--

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.000
 It's sleep faster.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.320
 You're talking about such a well-oiled machine.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.840
 Like, you don't want to be in the grinds that to a halt.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.840
 Do you know what I mean?

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.280
 How would you keep the machine going?

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.000
 Right, right.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.720
 Ranking out the records.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.960
 I hear the owners, like, the Elon Musk of our labels,

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.720
 where, you know, 120-hour weeks.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.640
 And if you're not pulling your weight, like--

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.640
 Yeah.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.720
 It's not just a label.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.640
 It's a lifestyle.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.640
 It is.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.720
 It's like driving by that building in Ohio

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.960
 where they make the crews.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.400
 But it's just like a fucking--

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.000
 It's just Greg's face on the fucking side.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.840
 Holy shit.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.400
 It's just one of those electronic billboards

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.880
 and it's just me making a fucking mutable instrument

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.680
 and ambient trash.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:13.040
 I'm just in the factory doing it 24/7.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.480
 Oh my god.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.760
 He's got like sandals on him.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.600
 There's a cactus next to him.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.360
 Reverb tail never ends.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.440
 Just keeps going.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.640
 Like my suffering.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.480
 There's just like a stack of strum and petals next to him.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.280
 Each one's being right into the next.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.960
 So these robot arms just twiddling knobs on elements.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.920
 Oh my god.
