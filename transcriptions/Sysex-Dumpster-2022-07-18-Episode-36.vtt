00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.420
 Like you pulled up at the top and then you put like a pack as is it's not like a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.660
 Fancy cigarette case where you take out the cigarettes and you put them in. Oh, I'm sorry. It's just a table

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.620
 Yeah, you just look like a change purse. Yes

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.860
 Yeah back when smoking used to be stylish. Yeah, yeah

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.660
 Used to yeah or if you have like a cigarette hole holder. That was a cool that was a cool look

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.220

 10 bucks a pack like you're doing already for yourself really dedicated to cancer

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:22.700
 Yeah, it's been I don't think I've had a cigarette like a decade or 11 years or something like the high prices have really weeded out the

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.840
 Smoking plebs right only the elite give them on the vape stay on it these days

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.900

 How the fuck did we get down this

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.440
 I was gonna

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.760
 Talk about water. We definitely lost our aquafina sponsorship. Yeah, this is always blowing our sponsors

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.760
 Yeah last like five minutes

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.680

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.760
 Episode 36

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.280
 I trust you with these numbers. I try to keep track 36 chambers of your rack right

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.200
 Yeah, Wu tang shout out to signal sounds for the sponsorship for the free effects

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.200
 April

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.760
 No, they fucked up and sent it to me by accident. I think this is close as we've gotten to getting

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.120
 It

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.120
 Did we get a mailing error?

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.800
 mailing error and we made it boys

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.640
 Please send us your prototypes by accident by accident

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200
 Then ask Andrew hey money

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.600
 Yeah, that's because to pay money. That is what I will not do

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.320
 Not get that back unless UPS comes to my house very politely

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.160
 And even then like have you thought about putting like a module that you're not interested in in the box

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.240
 And sending that bag goes just what it came up in a brick. Yeah, that's how I that's what I do with routers

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.240
 I've told you my router trick right?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.800
 I've only bought one router in the 90s and then I get a neckier router take my old one

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.280
 Put it in that box and then return it

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.660
 They they they used to at least look at it open it up and go. Yeah, this is not a neckier

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.320
 Router and they would accept the return last time I did it

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.800
 I went through the trouble of you basically putting my old shitty router into this box and returning they didn't even fucking open it

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.680
 Like yeah, it could have been empty. They don't care. Yeah, so that's what I used to do with my graphics cards

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.800
 Yeah, with Best Buy. Oh, yeah, every two years go get like a new EVGA

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.920
 Throw in the old one the one time I went through all the trouble of removing the heat sinks

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.800
 Yeah, you know, you know the fans and stickers so that it looked legit put it all in the package

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.760
 Yeah, same deal thing fucking look at it. It was like come on man

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.200
 Like made me feel like I you know I'm getting away with it

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.440
 That with NPCs and guitar center, but it was actually a broken

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.760
 NPC 1000 or they might have broken or something like that and they just like swap the guts out

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.840
 Send it back the fresh NPC inside nice work

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.640
 Good for them. Fuck all these corporations

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.320
 I can't really do anymore the graphic cards are so fucking ridiculous now like no

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.200
 the size of a computer and

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.680
 Can't just do the old swap of the heat sink now like yeah, they're like in like, you know a solid chunk of metal

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.760
 Yeah, I mean they're basically small little computers in and of themselves at this point. Yeah

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.720
 You know with the recent like crypto crash. It'll be interesting to see what happens with that

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.840
 They're coming down in press. Yeah and available for a long time

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.920
 You just couldn't get them because crypto was just buying all that shit up

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.480
 I love all the farms like trying to sell like totally like

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.040
 Nice burned down

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.000
 Here are 10 bucks. It's like dude. That is not gonna do any more bitcoin mining

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.480
 It's been uh, it's only been two months since the last episode

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.360
 Really only been two months. I it feels like a fucking year. It does

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.240
 Yeah

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.760
 We and we were going to record earlier, but this is it's my fault

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.160
 I will accept the blame for the delay in this one. I would like

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.720
 Summer a lot. He's just you're just like, yeah, just we always generically summer. Yeah, that's true. It's hot

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.520
 It's gonna take a little more time. I think we got these summer flings

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.720
 We gotta go on a lot of dates at the sock hop

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.320
 Yeah, I tried to keep track of some of the stuff that has occurred

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.120
 Since the last episode and now

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.160
 You have a timeline. Yeah, not I didn't go as far as making a time. Let's get it. Um

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.360
 We we lost some great names. Oh, yes, this is true

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.280
 We lost

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.720
 evangelists

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.320
 Dave Smith

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.760
 Andy Fletcher

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.480
 And Massimo Marante didn't we also lose close

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.320
 All schools did it. Yeah, I missed that one. Yeah, Jesus. I repeat all of them. All right, Pete all

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.720
 Crazy. That's heavy heavy two months. Yeah, yeah

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.800
 um

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.200
 It wasn't a death but in mutable instruments announced they're discontinuing

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.400
 All production not just making new stuff

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.480
 um

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.760
 That really bummed me out to hear shouldn't announce why but I think we can all probably

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.320
 Figure out some of the elements that led to that decision

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.120
 um still bomber companies abusing

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.680
 or uh open source model. Yeah, um

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.120
 See what else we got here

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.520
 Do do do oh super booth and summer nam both happened in the last two months

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.680
 I have I've noticed on uh things that I saw at super booth. Okay. Um, I think nam was just a regurgitation

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.120
 Yeah, so I don't think much came out during nam that I remember. I mean, is there more on your timeline?

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.800
 No, I

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:08.080
 I just jotted down some of the stuff that also caught my eye from both super booth and nam following that

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.600
 Um, so yeah, we can just dip into that shit. That works for me

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.560
 Hell yeah

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.560
 I mean who wants to start

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.640
 You me you you said

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.680
 Steve be much super booth before we get going do you want me to just rifle through my list or do one and round robin

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.240
 We can round robin all right. Let's round robin this um

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:35.440
 Nana I don't want to start with I want to start with this one. Um, uh, the soma terra

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.480
 I totally missed that was this too

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.920
 No, this is the weird wood instrument

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.120
 Oh, okay, so it's made of

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.240
 world

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.680
 What was that terrifying voice you just did that's from a full house dude. Come on, dave

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.280
 It's the wood chuck guy fucking joey. Yeah, what can I remember Bible man?

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.160
 Wait, what wait what?

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:08.320
 That's Bible man. Was he all do religious too? Yeah, that's Bible man. Yeah, um wait

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:14.240
 Not john stamas not john stamas the other brother. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's Bible man

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.120
 Really? Yeah, that's like

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.360
 absurd

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.080
 We're gonna say fact check this because I don't want to be wrong, but I'm like 99.5

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.080
 Percential. We don't need a faction

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.120
 Hello listeners dave here

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.600
 I'm interrupting our broadcast to let you know that I was wrong

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.000
 Bible man is willy aims who played buddy lembec

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.800
 the goofy best friend of the titular charles and charles in charge

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.280
 The goofy uncle joey in four house was played by dave kulee

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.920
 Who briefly dated canadian singer songwriter alana's more set

00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:00.640
 Is believed by some that she wrote the top 10 smash hit single you want to know about him

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.680
 We now return to our regularly scheduled broadcast already in progress

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:13.280
 That's how we roll here. We don't verify. Yeah, thanks be damned now on

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.680
 He's bible man. He's bible man. Um, but no, it's um, so it's

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.400
 it's it's main sort of like

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:27.440
 Presentation is it's a chunk of wood and it's got a lot of body contacts and um a couple of knobs that affect

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.720
 um

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.720
 different parameters and

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.760
 So, but what is it is a sin? It is a sin is a full voice synth

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.640
 Kind of like the lyra, but made of wood or what?

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.880
 That's a really good question

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:47.200
 Because a lot of the videos I saw were basically just people showing it off and showing like there's a big sort of set of

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.800
 Body contacts that sort of line up with as you would sort of ergonomically place your hand on it

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.000
 And then sort of beside them are these smaller body contacts that are modifiers on that

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.240
 Um almost it kind of reminded me a little bit of like an accordion

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.560
 Where you would have like notes and then you would have these sort of like modifiers to them

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.720
 So the they're typically pitch

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.360
 But if you press another body contact and hit it it becomes a argument for

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.960
 Um a parameter all digital polyphonic

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.760
 um crazy um

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.160
 uh like effects and reverb and

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:30.080
 Super these sort of like lush sounds were coming out of it. Um, and yeah, the whole thing is encased in um basically like a

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.840
 Cross-section like a slice of uh of a tree like you can see like the bark on the outside of it

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.280
 Like it looks like an end table. I didn't notice that. That's cool

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:46.480
 It was um, I mean there's there's a gimmick element obviously of it being in this wood thing, but the sounds

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.040
 Maybe not necessarily for me, but it kind of maybe a

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.200
 An apanology is a sort of cross between like full tech and um

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.720
 The other some of the the pipe. Mm. Um

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.200
 But it caught my eye and I don't I there was no I couldn't see anything about praise

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.800
 Um

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.080
 But yeah, I thought that was a that was a standout weird instrument and I think it's

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:15.280
 Continuing with the soma just bonkers approach to everything they do which uh, I'm here for I'm here for

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.760
 I'm all I'm all in favor of it didn't even know they had something new coming up last I saw they had like

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.880
 Midi looper sequence. Yeah, yeah

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.960
 I think it's audio loopers in midi looper. I thought it was a sequence looper, but it could be wrong

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.480
 I don't know because it does something where like changes it constantly. I don't know

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.440
 It didn't really catch my attention. So I didn't look too far into it. Yeah

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.200
 Well, maybe if it was housed in a chunk of wood or piece of granite absolutely

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.880
 It was in quartz. Maybe it was quartz. I would buy it whatever it was

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.280
 I mean, he usually is interesting stuff so I can see like normally like it's gonna be worth it

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.720
 Exactly

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.640
 Even without the novelty of it being in wood

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.040
 Probably would have come at eye just for how

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.160
 The weird sounds they were doing the way they were performing with it

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.960
 seemed like an interesting take on it. Mm-hmm

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:07.120
 When did it say it was gonna come out or like I got nothing as far as release dates or price or availability or

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.760
 You know, it's it's it's it seems like they were very focused on present all the videos

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.760
 I saw were just presenting

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:19.440
 The idea so I I have no other information outside of that other than I'll keep an eye on it

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.640
 And if it's reasonably priced, I might give it a shot

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.600
 Seems to be kind of a common vibe with super booth this year. A lot of people didn't really have

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.560
 a timeline or even

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.200
 A definitive price for a lot of stuff. They were showing off. It was more just showing off proof of concept

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.120
 Stuff I've noticed the only the only thing I have a definitive price on

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.640
 And it's a lot is the erica centrix 2

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.720
 Ah, that was on my first list or the first on my list. That's that's why it's between

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:52.080
 I was between that and the the terra, um, but 1800 euros

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.160
 And say I have a higher price than that

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.400
 But yeah, if you're saying euros and that's probably why my nose. Oh, yeah

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.240
 This was from gert's while he was it was one of the videos where he was like 1800 euros

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.280
 I was like

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.800
 Not surprised it does a lot but that was literally the only thing I saw a price attached to more than the last one

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.040
 Less it is less. That's what I wrote in my notes at least if I recalled

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.480
 I don't remember the exact number of the original centrix, but I swear it was over 3,000

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.600
 Yeah, I think it was 3,200

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.960
 Yeah, this is like a thousand dollars less

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.160
 It comes in at 2179 USD

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.000
 Would you like to talk about that correct sure? I I tried it some notes that well

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.800
 I tried it some no sound about erica's announcements overall

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:39.680
 Yeah, um the first one that really caught my eye was the lxr o2 euro module. Yep. Yep. Um

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.760
 Yeah, I mean we've discussed the lxr quite a few times in previous episodes both of them

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.880
 Both versions. Yeah, and you know

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.560
 We're all fans of it in all its for eyes forms

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.800
 And this is kind of a cool surprise. Not something I saw coming

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.400
 Um, oh that sounds refreshing. It is

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.840
 It's funny you say that about yeah, of course. It's funny great because this is uh the arsenal

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.600
 Um picket bone dry. Oh, which is what I dressed up

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.360
 This is the stuff that you have gotten for me in the past and hated it. Yeah

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:21.440
 I think I remember you taking a sip of it. Oh, yeah, it's the cabin and I was just like how is it just like drinking sand

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:27.040
 I think you said it made you more thirsty than when you started drinking it did is what was your review of this?

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.040
 It made my mouth dryer. It's delicious

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.720
 How's that even physically possible? But you heard that fizzing. I did it here. It's a damn good fizz. It's good. Yeah

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.000
 Not my not my cup of tea, but yeah lxr module. Yeah, um

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.520
 Pretty cool. It's super compact like, you know, I've been trying to get away from doing drums and modular again

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.400
 Not me. Um, yeah

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.400
 Yeah

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.240
 This this kind of wants me to just kind of pull me back in that direction a little bit

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.080
 This would be a in my opinion like a really good heart

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:08.080
 Of a modular drum system. Yeah, um, it's only like 500 bucks. Um, it has

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:16.640
 Seven trigger ends six accent ends five cv inputs and four audio outputs. So

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:23.120
 It's not just, you know, you're not just triggering static sounds like cv inputs. Yeah. Oh

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.480
 Did not pick that up. Yeah, that's kind of what piqued my interest to goes like that is cool

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.360
 Because that's something that I've always felt the elixir lack like, you know, I use the on board elifos

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:39.760
 Does it still have the on board modulation? Yes, it's still the same engine. So 500 bucks

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:46.480
 It's actually cheaper than the stand alone. It is because you don't have all the oh power

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:52.400
 You don't have the power. You don't have the sequencer. Yeah, so you will have to spend money to sequence this thing

00:17:52.960 --> 00:18:00.080
 Which I think ericos smart. Yeah, picking this up because it looks like it would be perfect to pair up with the erica drum sequence

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.120
 Absolutely. Um, the strong point of the elixir are either

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:11.200
 See, no, like I always enjoyed the micro steps. Yeah, but yeah, if you're doing it all in euro anyways, you have a lot of options for that sort of thing already

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.840
 Um, so yeah, it's pretty appealing

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.080
 I feel like that was their strongest release and I think that is available now

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.120
 There was places that were offering it for sale

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.600
 Um everything else that they were talking about the centrix and the perkins. Yep all pre-order still

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.400
 um

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.920
 Yeah, I don't entirely know the differences between centrix one and two. I tried looking it up

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.600
 It was a little confusing to me. I because sonically it sounded

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:47.200
 Pretty similar, but I also this was youtube videos and I've not actually experienced either of them live

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.240
 um, but what I was what the demos I was seeing of the centrix two had that same sort of

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.760
 like

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.000
 70s noise freak out vibe. Um

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.200
 But I mean it must be different somehow if it's significantly cheaper

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.920
 And they bothered to make a new version of it. They could have just kept going with the original rev

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.720
 Yeah, they're not like clear about the delta between the two either

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.840
 That's the thousand bucks. Why should I get this one still right?

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.480
 No, because this is the new one that I will be able to buy you know comes in black this time

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.960
 Yeah, it does look cool. It's a little smaller too or something a little more compact. What was it?

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.760
 Not sure it looked pretty big. I mean they both look pretty big. So it's a big

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.800
 And they both had a joystick

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.880
 joystick matrix model very looks very similar scinthe inspired. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it was very clear where they were

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:41.040
 Taking inspiration from but I remember listening to the demos of the first one and first being completely

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.800
 Turned off by the price and then secondly by how much it didn't sound like a scinthe to my ears

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.360
 Yeah, so this is kind of like no, so I just kind of dropped it off my radar

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.680
 No, no speakers. No spring reverb. Oh no spring rerout

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:03.360
 More effects and sequencing options. Mm. Well, I don't think that would drop the price by a thousand from spring verb

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.520
 Was it an actual spring? I thought it was a digital or am I thinking of the so real deal? Okay

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.840
 I mean it still doesn't explain the thousand dollars, but yeah, maybe they listened to us bitching about the price

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:22.160
 Over time. It seems likely what that Perkins like we have that much influence. I mean, I had another thing in my erica since the list

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.400
 The Perkins no no, um actually it's

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:32.640
 It's kind of a deviation from probably what we would normally talk about

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.280
 I was really impressed with the updates to the edu

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.080
 Series. Oh, those are cool. Yeah, and it's it's a partnership with moritz klein

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.520
 Um, and it's entry level diy modules super easy to build very

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:53.600
 It's designed to help you sort of get your feet wet with since of this and understanding it and they added a what they were

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:59.360
 Showing it super booth at least. Um, they were adding a sequence or two it all diy all super cheap

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.760
 Easy to make um

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.320
 I think it's awesome that they're doing that like to really sort of like break down that barrier of this being somewhat

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.800
 um, you know, tooth

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.320
 Thought it's thought to be a somewhat obtuse and difficult thing to get into

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:17.200
 And it's kind of breaking that down a little bit into it like here. No, this is how you get started with it

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.600
 Doesn't have to be this huge

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.120
 um financial investment and here's the primitives you need to get going

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.000
 Yeah, and actually how the circuit works and they just walk you through that which nobody have built a bunch of modules

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.840
 And I don't know how any of them work like that. So that's really cool. Yeah, it's like a fucking really simple module

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.440
 Yeah, exactly. So I I wanted to give them a little bonus shout out for

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.600
 Trying to pass on education and make this a little bit easier to get into yeah

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.920
 Yeah, I almost got the sequence or for that reason. I was like, oh no, and it's cool

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.280
 Like I still might someday but it was like I don't need to go down the project of learning how a sequence or works at a basic

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.600
 Electronic level right now. I just want more time to use it. But it's cool. That's available like yes

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.800
 It's a yeah, I so I want to give them a little a little bit of a

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:05.840
 Nod for for adding that to their lineup, but yeah, the Perkins I think probably needs to be discussed at greater length

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.120
 Yeah, and well, I don't think there's much to really discuss

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.000
 still they uh, they're basically just announced it's open for pre-orders finally, right?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.320
 And we did talk about it from the original preview. Oh, yeah, and a lot of stuff. Yeah, and that's the thing just

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:24.400
 That was it's been like a year now at least oh, yeah, because you're right and we still don't have a whole lot of

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:31.120
 More information other than uh, it's going to cost at least the pre-orders cost 2059

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.040
 USD

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.640
 Ah, that's my go up even more after pre-order phase. Not sure. That's really expensive. It's expensive

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.840
 It's really cool, but yeah, it's a full-blown drum machine with sequencer and CV abilities like

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.840
 I

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.520
 In 2020 I feel like two grand for a fully fledged drum machine

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.760
 It's kind of fair. I mean, I remember paying that type of money for a tempest years ago

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.760
 You know, I mean but

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:03.040
 rhythms like $1,800 or something like that. I think more is it? Yeah, because I was looking at them

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.000
 in comparison to the um

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.680
 The new one the centric. I thought they were 1500s. I remember

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.800
 I was buying dirt. They're more than double centric

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.800
 Holy shit. Yeah, I think they're like 2,100. Damn

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.960
 20 money and b2300. I don't know why that number's popping in my brain, but a centric is like a grand

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.440
 Um, and yeah, because I was thinking I was like, why would someone want to get this

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:33.200
 Centric and not just get a rhythm and then I saw it because it's literally like twice the price

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:38.560
 1700 for rid the mark too. Really? Okay. I thought it was more

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.520
 I don't know what I'm thinking of then

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:47.200
 So shit's just expensive is what this is going to be pricey. Yeah, I I need to stop being shocked at

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.680
 sticker prices. Yeah, well

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.080
 Erica, I give them props like they don't seem like they're

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:58.960
 Their prices seem can seem consistent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, in fact like in the case of the centric

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.480
 Centric my getting can name transfuse non-lavery

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.120
 Centrics it's centrics. That's why I had the new electron box. Oh

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.000
 Syntax syntax. Sorry. Yes. That's what I was trying to say before

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.800
 In comparison. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have syntax on my on my list if we want to talk about it either me either

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.360
 I I could do an episode without

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.920
 Talking about electron for once. Absolutely. Yeah, but what about electron corner?

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.360
 Is it gonna be dusty and yeah and alone and we just did mention them and this is the electron corner and that's it

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.440
 That's it perfect. That's it for the wrap it up

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.080
 Case dismissed short and sweet

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:44.320
 What if that's the thing that we get fucking sued and taken down for? Yes

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.800
 Of all the shit we do

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.800
 But on the uh, jeers section of the erica corner, holy shit that black sequencer so close to being good

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.920
 You shouldn't have software for something that means you can't fucking mute the channels reliably

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.600
 Like you've deeply fucked up if it doesn't mute correctly

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.080
 That's all I can say about that. That's a bummer because I know you were excited about it. It was cool

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.160
 Um, but yeah, there are a few things about it. It was just like I can't roll with this

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.160
 I don't know if you need 16 knobs to be able to twist you on a sequence or honestly

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.160
 I'm down for holding a step and turning one knob over and over like it doesn't

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.960
 You didn't really pan out in that way. Yeah, lots of cool features UI was perfect

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:29.040
 But like the basic stuff to work are you need like an emergency release to like get muting to fucking work

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.120
 Like it doesn't and people are like yeah, it's been like that for six months. It's like god damn

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.680
 Yeah, I don't want to buy that. Fuck you

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.600
 I had similar gripes with the drum sequencer back in the day in a similar situation

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.400
 Yeah, I remember encountering little things like that

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:50.560
 But I think the firmware for that is at least an updated sense right a lot and in much better state

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.680
 I don't know how you can't just like

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.880
 Even hack it to be like oh give up just make it so that output channel is at zero fucking volts like

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:04.720
 I don't know. I knew software isn't as easy as people like to imagine it is. There's probably a reason that doesn't make sense

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.920
 But holy shit, it's just muting a fucking channel

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.720
 That in the way of the panel was arranged was a little weird

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.560
 It was like someone laid it out on Photoshop. Mm-hmm. I didn't really like used it and figured out where things should kind of be, you know

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.760
 Yeah, one of those gripes

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:27.280
 It's not a gripe. No, it's legit. Yeah, you're a yeah, you're a sequencer guru addicted to them

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.320
 We need a higher nick is our go-to

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.400
 sequencer

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.400
 Um, what's the word like?

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:40.000
 I'm curious where you're going with this like if I ever have a question

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:47.360
 Like oracle oracle. Yeah, you like the sequencer oracle. You like tried them all you know them all

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:55.920
 I suck with sequencing. Oh, yeah, no you terrible. So what you described? Why a hasty beat actually was a man in my existence like

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.680
 I do love them. There's something just really fucking appealing to me about a sequencer

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:09.360
 It's like fucking it's something really weird. I don't know ever since that machine drama like broke me kind of this is foreshadowing for us

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.320
 Talking about talking about the poly and play at some point

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.800
 Gotcha the third act is gonna come back

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:22.960
 Check off sequencer has to come back in the third act. Well, there's something I wanted to mention

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.800
 I don't know why I didn't have it at the top because it's

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.960
 I'm personally really excited. Well, super excited

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:37.600
 Endorphins announced. Oh god yet another module that probably won't work right have a bad noise floor

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.920
 Rather have a terrible noise floor. Mm-hmm and but

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.120
 It has Andrew

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:51.040
 Wang's name. Yeah, the uh on the panel the the tried the trying to do everything module. Yeah

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:58.640
 Really? Of course ghost which is appropriate because it's fucking dead on arrival in my opinion. Oh take that

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.840
 Really clean panel though like not much going on

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:08.320
 Are you okay? Absolutely so cast absolutely packed with fucking text. I

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.360
 We last at it and I was like, I don't even know what this thing's supposed to fucking do

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.080
 I watch a video. I gave it a fair shot

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.680
 I always give indoor friends a fair shot. Yeah, everything that I've tried by them

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.560
 Makes fucking weird noises that it shouldn't make doesn't work properly

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:28.160
 Things are like backwards. It's you know, I feel like they have some serious quality control

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.320
 Oh, yeah, and the fact that like

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.960
 They've released so many products over the last year or two

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.200
 Haven't nailed those down, but now they're doing collaborations with influencers

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.600
 Yeah, I think just kind of really goes the show

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:47.760
 The direction that they're going and that's just marketing and cranking shit out regardless if it's actually like functional and this thing seems completely directionless

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.360
 It's just like well. What if we just add this on top of it and this and this and this for what it's trying to do

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.440
 It's packing far too much

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.960
 Into a single module and I don't get a strong sense that it does any of the things on that list

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.640
 Particularly well, yeah, because it's there like two parameters for every effect

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:09.360
 Yeah, I guess the thing is like it's a multi effect that does all these things but like do you really fucking want that?

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:15.920
 Especially if they got two parameters and it's it's gonna have like some 12 bit digital noise floor at like negative 50 decibels

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.440
 that's like

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.560
 There and all their gear, you know, that sampler was a fucking joke by the way

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.320
 supposedly they got it nailed down in some of the more recent versions of the

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.080
 squawk filter. Oh, yeah, which

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.080
 It was the most recent one that I tried and it was the one to be in shit. Oh, yeah

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.240
 I returned it the next day. Yeah, that's what did with the sample player thing

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.160
 It turned like the next day and none of us bought that weird what was a black noir

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.600
 The rum machine thing that they tried to do the weird 90

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.840
 Yeah, that once I I mean we ripped that apart in a previous episode if I recall

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:54.240
 But yeah, once I saw that you couldn't even tune the kick drum. Yeah, like well, I mean you can but not easily

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.600
 You know, I was like you gotta be fucking kidding me and their excuse for that was well

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.840
 The kick isn't something that you're going to be changing a lot

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.720
 And I was just like that is good days are

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.920
 If you're buying something that is based on a 909

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.720
 you

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.800
 like

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.080
 You should have like an entire panel dedicated to the fucking kick

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:21.600
 It's funny because one of the other things on my list is a kick drum module that has a ton of modulation and parameters

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:27.600
 It's just a kick module. So it's someone who's like basically like let's not write

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:33.760
 And you need to have a ton of control and it needs some morph over time. It needs a morph per step

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.400
 Like we want interesting kick drums. Yeah, that was the opposite of that. Yeah

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.120
 What a huge mess

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.000
 the

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.720
 Scaled down your ability to just tune the kick but added dumb shit like cabin pressure and thing

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.680
 That's really that's how you get that dark tech note sound like is it

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.760
 Really?

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.760
 One would think maybe down tuning your kick might have a part of that sound too

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.720
 But what do I know? Well, we get a trimmer behind the thing if you really need to do

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.960
 Yeah, Andrew Wong's

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.960
 I never know if I'm pronouncing his name. I think

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.920
 I think I've heard him say it not he says it at the start of every episode

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.440
 Yeah, he gives himself a high five and then make sure to say his name to himself

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.000
 But some reason I don't remember

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.400
 Yeah, you just get forwarded to

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.000
 Meat of this whatever this video is

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.400
 um

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:33.200
 And I always make sure to skip over his rap sessions as well. That's it. Oh, yeah. Oh, no

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.400
 I was a rough one recently now. I listened to all of them because it is

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.400
 Beautiful torture. Mm. It is really exquisite

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.160
 I remember I'm singing to like a crystal dog or something one in one video on a moon

00:31:46.160 --> 00:32:00.160
 I'll stick to my div kid videos. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, we're just really down to the point

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.600
 I'm gonna get stuck in over technical overviews. Yeah, let's get stuck in. Yeah, let's let's stay the fuck off the moon

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.160
 Let's get stuck in so yeah, I'm not I I don't even have that uh that collab

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.960
 module on my list I I put it on there because like it just kind of

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:22.080
 I remember scrolling through like the day's announcements at the time and just seeing that and I was like what in the fuck is this

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.880
 I do have to make out of this. Can always like see that email. What do you want to do?

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.000
 I've got all these ideas. Let's do all I think

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.400
 Like a compressor but a filter

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.840
 Maybe a delay

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.400
 Or is it even a is there even at the lane? I like to I forget a reverb. Yeah, distortion

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.320
 I don't even know filter might be the one thing that's not on there. It's like everything else

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.800
 I don't know it doesn't seem very innovative. It seemed very big

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.120
 Is it stereo?

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.600
 I I think I saw a stereo in and out like this is how much attention I pay to it

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.440
 You know, I mean like I just

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.000
 And I love my weird effects process

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.760
 But I scroll through that and I just knew off the bat it would probably sound like shit. Not work correctly. Have a high noise floor

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:13.120
 And it has an influencer's name pasted right on it like why the who who asked for that? That's a bit much

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:20.720
 So fast forward three months from now when one of us gets it 12. Oh my god. I was totally wrong

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.440
 Sorry listeners. It is stereo

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.800
 Compressor ball and tone distortion side chain delay reverb filter

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.560
 With no parameters over any of those circuits

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.560
 barely anything and it's it's a real fucking mess. Yeah

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.880
 Um, but that was an intro to a joke. Oh, I actually did have sorry. I'm not no no

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.720
 Glad we all rolled with it. Yeah

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.680
 I thought I could actually get you guys going for a minute

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.160
 But you guys like knew immediately

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.160
 As I said endorsements

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.160
 There's no way I was being serious

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.600
 Um, but yeah, there was an effects unit that did really catch my eye that did seem kind of cool

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.880
 um

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:10.000
 Company called fine gear, which I was incredibly unfamiliar with apparently they made some weird like spring verb

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.960
 lo-fi box thing. Um, and now they have a new one. It's a tape delay

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:20.080
 Sort of really with actual tape. Yes. Oh cool. Yeah

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.720
 You can see the tape in the front. I think you can physically access the playheads

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.920
 But the tape itself is behind like a clear looks like like plastic or something, you know, um, but yeah

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.480
 It's an actual tape actual analog

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.960
 um

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.320
 It's a multi effects unit though. It's not just a taped lay

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.040
 um, it's

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.320
 Why am I drawing a blank on the name? Oh the dirt magnet is what they're calling it. No

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.240
 Um

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:54.080
 So it has the tape is it a is it a standalone or is it a mod standalone? Okay, but semi modular

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.800
 Which is what really caught my eye. Okay. Cool. Uh, everything on it has like cv parameters

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.600
 Including the tape drive itself. You can trigger. Oh, like change the speed of the

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.480
 The playback to be a cv. That's um

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.880
 You can cv the speed the region and the panning

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.600
 of the actual

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:20.000
 Motor and also there's a gate input which I think starts and stops the play. Yeah

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.960
 So that caught my eye right off the bat. Um, but then the

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.560
 it goes through a ms 20 based filter

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.960
 um

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.560
 a

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.920
 Ring mod

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.040
 a crackle circuit and a noise source circuit

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.040
 And it has two digital syncable LFOs

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:46.880
 All of these circuits are cvable and the whole thing is stereo through and through

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.720
 It sounds like something out of a fever dream. I had. Yeah, that's how fucking amazing. It looked amazing. I was like

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.800
 I'm kind of really into this. Yeah

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:59.360
 It's big. Okay, it's yeah, it's not tiny. Um, it

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:06.400
 It looks like the size of maybe like a soma labs pulsor maybe even bigger. Like it's just a big square

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.000
 You know, it means like this big wooden thing. Um

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.040
 Definitely a desktop unit

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.000
 Um, but yeah semi modular with all of it

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.720
 Not to derail, but you remember that vapor where like cassette

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:25.280
 Delay module that was also huge. No. Yeah. Yeah

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.520
 Remember like it's still people are probably trying to get their money from it like uh

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:36.400
 It looked amazing. Yeah, like cv control over most of what you mentioned like this cassette based module. That was like, oh the module

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:42.800
 I do remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think only five ever came out. Yeah, something. Yeah, I saw one pop up used once on

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.200
 Uh on the wiggler. Yeah, and I was like, whoa someone actually had one of these. Um

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.480
 Yeah, I for similar in size to that maybe

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.480
 No, it's it's like kind of flat in the square

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.280
 You know, like it definitely looks more like a like a

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:04.640
 Pulsar type of design. You know module. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's semi modular though. Like it has cv inputs

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.800
 Uh, is there any kind of eta on this because I kind of want one now

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.120
 So is it now? No, Greg is it now? It's not what about now

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.800
 Fine gear announced at 13 aiming for it to be done by the end of summer

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.520
 They're having some mechanical speed stability issues that they're still ironing out

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.400
 And they estimate it'll be around a thousand euro

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:30.320
 So that's a lot of praise right? Yeah, that I even though just 10 minutes goes complaining about price

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.280
 I'd be willing to spend that much for something bonkers like that. That sounds really cool. They can deliver that

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.240
 Yeah, stereo and it's cvable, you know, and you're getting like multiple

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.600
 Effects and it's a yeah, it's steep

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:50.080
 It also feels like you're kind of buying a pinball machine where like yeah, you're about to like get in a lot of mechanical problems

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.520
 Let me just pull up a picture for you. Oh, this is not even though our listeners cannot uh, I'll just grab visual eyes

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.600
 Yeah, let me

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.600
 fine gear

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.440
 dirt

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.440
 Mike wow great

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.280
 That fingernail polish. It's pretty bad. What the fuck it's been a month

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.480
 You knew you were having guests

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.160
 To my hair is a mess today. My fingernail polish is fucking nice

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.120
 Just deal with it

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.680
 So there's a picture of the the tape

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:27.520
 Compartment, so that's cool. Yeah, that gives you a better sense of like how it looks. Yeah, and the scale that is pretty big

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:32.000
 Damn, that looks awesome. Yeah, a lot of controls and of course a preamp

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.080
 Also going into the tip. So I imagine you can get some pretty good saturation of it. I hope

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.760
 They didn't really have any sound demos because of the complications that they're working through

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.760
 This is more just a prototype show off

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.000
 But yeah, I I for one I'm excited to hear how it actually sounds

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.400
 It's the company again fine gear fine gear. Yeah, never heard of them before

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.760
 They have my attention now

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.520
 So what else have they made that now that now that i'm interested in them?

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.240
 What else did they make that there was something else of similar size and shape it was called dirt

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.800
 um

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.800
 It was dirt something

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:17.120
 But it was like similar thing, but instead of a tape delay. It was a spring verb. Oh, okay

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:23.040
 Cool. Yeah, it totally caught me by surprise. You know me like I was scrolling through shit like the

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.960
 endorphins ghost and going and then

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:34.000
 Stumbled upon that and I was like, oh, I love the idea of having that we have here that relationship between cv and sort of mechanical

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.080
 Is really such a cool idea. It's not the only thing that was debuted like that. Also. There was the motor synth

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.320
 Oh, right. Yeah, shown off to I forget the name

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:47.120
 Forget that too. Yeah, but it seems short lived or at least had its blip and then was coming on

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:53.600
 They're hyping it up. Yeah, that's super boost again. Yeah, but I think which divine has one and he's done a couple things

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:58.640
 But I knew I wouldn't be getting one. It's like a cool concept. I have no

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.600
 So we'll do gimmicky

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:07.360
 Yeah, they need the dust collector too. I remember that's that's it's a collector. Yes. Thank you

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.120
 Yeah, remember that because I remember like in the enclosure. I was like, oh, that looks nice

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.840
 It's cool. It's nice to see someone do something very different like that

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.720
 It was only five 30

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.760
 Oh

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.600
 It's pretty good. Yeah, so

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.560
 Fine gear if you're listening or anyone out there got that got that connect

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.840
 Put a good word for the sisex dumpster crew

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.320
 We want to get our hands on it even a broken one. Yeah, even one that doesn't

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.360
 Work right we're cool with that. Yeah, we'll put an asterisk beside the our review

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.560
 Yeah, we'll do an in-depth review to our millions of listeners

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:47.520
 Millions don't look into it, but we have a million. Yes, there's millions of us

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.800
 Yes

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.560
 Pay no attention to the fact that all the IP addresses go to a Russian bot form

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.200
 But we have millions of millions

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.800
 um

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.800
 Nick do you have anything for super booth?

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.240
 Yeah

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.360
 Precious little from super booth. I did not I would admit I didn't pay attention to it all that much

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.400
 Really?

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.360
 Because I don't even think the effects aid pro was like announced and that was like

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.080
 That was like a ninja release ninja. Yeah, it was a little a little bit after that. Yeah

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.960
 my list

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.720
 My list has a couple more things on it. I don't know if we want to get into them

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.040
 um

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.320
 We were talking about kick drums and parameters thereof

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.520
 This was not something I was super excited about personally, but it was weird to see

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:35.440
 It pop up on a lot of people's lists and people seem very excited about it

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.880
 Um, so I figured it was worth mentioning the na Bula

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.960
 kick-ain

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:46.480
 Kick-ain. Oh, yeah, kick-ain. Kick-ain. There are kids for that too. I don't know. That'd be cool for me

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.360
 In looking at the maybe I'm thinking about the kick drum one, but go ahead

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.760
 um, but uh

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.120
 999 sounding a lot of parameters and arguments

00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:03.120
 Um, but what I thought was the most interesting about it and worthy of sort of talking about was it has a built-in sidechain compressor

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.080
 Is and so you could take these sort of audio in

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:12.240
 Um, they make the poly cinematic poly voice thing. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I know which one

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:18.720
 Um, and the compressor itself has multiple options. They have sort of a normal one and then these two

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.640
 um

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.080
 spectral

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.240
 uh sidechain compression, so it's not just based on level. Um, it does

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:31.920
 Based on the spectrum of frequencies coming in it'll do uh compression based on that

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.920
 Honestly, this sounds didn't blow me away. It sounds a little

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.920
 What you would expect that you know, I I don't know maybe I'm just

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.800
 Doesn't make gabber kick-steve

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:49.040
 Kinda it makes it makes it they're real clean. There's a little there's a little there's a snap or um

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.640
 it's a world click argument ransient

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.480
 It

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.080
 It was bassy. It honestly that part was a little

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.440
 I

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.320
 A little undercooked. I thought at least from the demos that they were showing

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:07.760
 For me, I would need and I think all of us would probably want to process the shit out of it when it came out

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:13.680
 But the idea of having a sort of um built-in sidechain compressor. Yeah, I would run through a ghost

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:20.000
 So you would run through a ghost. Yeah, and then that would make it sound give it that angi wang hip-hop flavor

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.480
 Oh

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.560
 Holy shit, that's the next one hip-hop flavor

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.040
 Oh god

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:36.480
 Um, but I mean I might give it another look when it's actually available. Yeah, but um really I just thought was worthy. Yeah on this

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:42.960
 Uh again like you were sort of mentioning earlier. No ETA. No price. I couldn't find anything about it. Um

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.360
 nebulous vaporware exactly

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:51.760
 Theme of this year's super that I'm gonna go on with the themes. Oh, I've I've got one actually

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:57.760
 It's not vaporware. I have which is a cubit aurora. Oh, yeah, which was announced at super booth

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.720
 I just realized yeah something I was extremely excited for and have yet to get yeah

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:08.880
 It's um cool. I was maybe drunk when I purchased it on apple pay on my phone, which is really fucking evil

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.400
 Um

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.800
 But yeah, it was announced at super booth and it was kind of intended to be like a reverb type effect

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.640
 Which I would think that is not really get it. That's all with a crazy light show

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.640
 Oh, yeah, it's beautiful

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:27.520
 Like if you like dark things with kind of psychedelic lights behind them like I think we all do um, it's a gorgeous module on the rack

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.520
 And it's even got this like

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:35.280
 Amazing back panel that covers the electronics that is translucent partially that has like this mountain scene

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:40.800
 That the led shine through and you get a little enamel pin of this graphic of this mountain scene too

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.800
 It's like really like oh, it's cool. Oh weird thing. I got ideas. I'll hold it up and show you too

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:50.080
 But it's like executed very well. Um to be honest at first. I was like

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:56.880
 It's a spectral vocoder basically that does like reverby type stuff and that has like something I enjoy very much

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.520
 Yeah

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:04.560
 Some abstracted controls like warp and like time and time is kind of like decay a little bit but it's more like

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:10.800
 I plagued with all it has modes do it has like different quality modes, which I didn't like any of the lower quality

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.400
 I really like higher one and almost which there was another one that was like even higher

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.040
 FFT window that was even more

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.120
 um

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.480
 Accurate or whatever you want to call it but with the last time but um

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:29.680
 It always adds like if you use it sparingly it adds this really nice like kind of overtone quality to most sounds

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.920
 You can find like kind of a sweet spot

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:38.320
 and it kind of like I can see why somebody would call it a reverb kind of effect because you can get things that sound like

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:46.080
 A shimmer effect like kind of these big sounds, but it's nothing like that sounds like a room or anything to me sure

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:53.120
 Um, and it really tight values like shorter time values or whatever that upper right knob is that kind of makes it less decay

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:58.000
 Um, it gets really interesting and you can get some nice flavors on like percussion and stuff like that

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 Which I'm sure you'd probably want to try with

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 My main application

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.120
 Um, so I really like it at first. I was like too spectrally. I kept getting like that FFT sound like remember

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:16.240
 DTBLK effects that plug-in. Yeah, which I really love actually and I kind of wish like they actually brought it back and that it still

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:22.480
 Run very well. Um, but there were moments of it that got flavors that I liked like that and there was like

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:28.640
 The pitch knob or like the knob at the top that changes like the pitch type artifact can be like a bit too much sometimes

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.080
 But it's definitely something where I like it. It's beautiful

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.960
 I didn't know what I was kind of asking for when I got it

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:40.880
 I didn't have much expectation, but I'm always able to seem like to find like kind of an overtone, especially on like

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:47.120
 Patty or like other type sounds that are longer duration that I'm like, oh, it sounds better with that or like

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:52.240
 Confines something to layer on top of it that it's a little more interesting and trippy to me

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.680
 Um

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:58.640
 And it's full stereo. Um, it's oh nice. Yeah, it sounds really good

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:03.680
 Um, I haven't even touched the shift button yet. So everything behind the shift menu the other knobs

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:08.160
 I haven't even tried yet. So I'm still like kind of getting used to it, but I'm really enjoying

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.720
 So what are the uh, the modulation input parameters? Like what can you have? Rogerlyn. Oh really

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:18.800
 Most of the I have the qubit cord to the v2 and I actually like really fucking like that module a lot

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.840
 And uh, one thing they do is they always generally have CV over everything and they always have like a shift button

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:29.200
 Mix you get control over the wet dry, which is awesome. Oh, yeah, there's a reverse mode and a freeze mode

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.200
 Really like freeze to be able to like catch these little kind of tones

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.400
 Um

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:40.800
 It's kind of similar to like beads freeze in a way. Um, where you're kind of like just like strapping this little bit of

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.600
 Spectral energy or whatever like clouds

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:49.120
 Um, but it sounds a little better a little more high-fi sounds very high-fi in ways

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:53.520
 The main reason why I haven't bought one yet like i'm really curious about it, but I do have multiple

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:58.960
 Monsumes currently that I use the spectral hidden mode with a lot

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.880
 And I was like, do I need something else to do that or can you know?

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.320
 Literally use the module and thought like I wondered how you would like it

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.160
 Knowing how much you like the spectral shit. Yeah clouds in monsoon. Love it

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:15.120
 Yeah, and like the reverse was very subtle which I think is just like reversing the buffer

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:21.360
 and then the interesting controls were reflect in atmosphere and atmosphere is like a drastic change to whatever's going on and like

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:28.880
 The atmosphere is hard to describe. It's like the almost room you're in and like the flavor it has or something like that or like what

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:33.040
 Uh, it's it is hard to describe some of these. That's why they're named like kind of weirdly

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.160
 Um blur was interesting to it. Just kind of like smudges

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:42.640
 The fft a little more. It's kind of like a filtering effect, but we're just like smudgy fft stuff and it's cool

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.800
 Um, it's definitely not something I'd use all the time and not crucial at all

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.160
 But I'm so far like really liking it as far as it's very unique

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:55.680
 Nothing that I've heard is like it except maybe the pan harmonium kind of from some things

00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:00.000
 I've heard like kind of similar in principle, but though very different and like application

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.840
 Um

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.320
 Yeah, at first I got it and I was like, oh shit. I fucked up

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.760
 This is too specterly for me

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:10.400
 But it was all about like toning it down a little and finding those sweet spots that were a little more subtle

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.520
 I think this is one effect that like I probably wouldn't keep it 100

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.560
 percent wet

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:20.640
 Or you're like that wet ever right more of just like kind of a shadow behind things a ghost if you will

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.480
 Brought to you by Andrew one

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.440
 But yeah, it's cool

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:33.440
 Nice, nice. I don't know how I'll feel about it in six months. Yeah, it's one of those things for two words

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:39.200
 Like, oh, maybe I just don't want this anymore. Well, you get bored of it. We'll do I'll take it off your hands

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.360
 Give it a shot put it through its pace. It didn't look like it was taking up a lot of space

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.280
 It looked like one of their tidier modules. It's not too big. I think it was like 12 or 14

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.000
 Right. I mean they they have some they have some big eyes

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.080
 Yeah, I'm glad to hear that like you're getting a lot of interesting stuff out without having to dip into like, you know

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.920
 The shift menu and shit like that. That's one thing that bothered me a lot about databender

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.640
 Like I liked databender

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.960
 Conceptually, but I kind of wish it was bigger and didn't have

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.320
 All these different color-coded modes and things to try to remember and same with the

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.240
 Filter slash comb delay that they released

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:22.320
 The fuck was that? I don't know. I had one. I can't remember the name

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:26.480
 Yeah

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.920
 Fracture

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:33.520
 Was that it? No, that's the WMD one. Now. I'm gonna have to look this up. Yeah, stand by listeners

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.240
 It was the prism

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:42.960
 Yeah, it had some stuff behind the scenes too, which you had to remember the color codes for and it just kind of annoyed me

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.760
 You don't like color codes. I remember that actually I love color codes

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:51.040
 That's how I base my life performances, but having to remember them and annoys me

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.160
 Well, that's the make noise thing that you hated because it was fun or gene morphogen

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.960
 Damn it. It was all color codes

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.960
 Yeah, well that wasn't just color codes

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:04.960
 It was key presses and combos and all this shit. I had like a fuck ton of functionality like hidden behind two buttons

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.960
 You know, it was like purple half yellow and it was that meant something different. Yeah. Yeah

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:14.640
 That was the the speed slash

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:19.600
 Pitch mode if I recall you see you seem it's a little bitter

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:25.120
 You look a little like I wanted to love that module. I still do it does things that I

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:29.440
 Have to use other things to try to do, you know what I mean?

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.360
 And it would be more convenient to use a morphogen if I jived with that

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:41.840
 Got awful interface in my opinion. Yeah, I don't know but I digress. I didn't mean to bring out something so traumatic

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.960
 I saw a video somebody doing something with the other day in comparison to something else. I was like, oh, that's cool

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.040
 Like I don't want to suffer through that

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.720
 Exactly

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.040
 I'm glad some people jive with it. Yeah, I know

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.160
 So my list is dwindling at this point

00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:01.920
 I've got a couple honorable mentions, but nothing uh, nothing. I really want to get too deep into

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.120
 I have the yach sak

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:08.320
 Hayach zak zak zak?

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.320
 zak zak

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.760
 Sofia chaos devices chaos devices. Um, the sofia

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:20.000
 I don't need it, but it did make some interesting sounds as a is a big old honkin

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.800
 Complex analog oscillator. Oh, oh yeah, oh, yeah, no dessa size

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.680
 Yeah, and it sounds amazing like the sounds that they were getting out of you know

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.360
 Just having a bunch of different modulations a bunch of these different sort of oscillators

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.920
 I think I kept coming back to when I was listening to the demos and their presentation and

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:43.280
 It's always sounded musical it didn't I mean I'm sure you can make

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.320
 Sound wonky and just sort of textury

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:51.040
 Um, but everything just felt all the demos and everything it felt harmonic all the time

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:56.880
 Um in this way that was sort of appealing. I can't imagine getting it. It's honking big thing

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:02.000
 Um, I'm on board with a lot of what chaos devices is is doing

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.960
 Um, and in fact I now that I've got the two mosque fuzz working in tandem

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:11.360
 I'm really interested in taking a deeper dive into that leap knits

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:16.480
 Binary system that they have yeah, yeah, it's so interesting. It's weird beast

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:20.480
 It's very weird. I don't feel like I fully have my head wrapped around it

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:25.360
 But they keep adding modules to it like it was started out with it was just the dress now

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.040
 But now it's the lip-sk the Jenna and the urnfit

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:34.960
 Like they keep adding to this ecosystem and the mosqueba can tie into it and actually generate

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:40.240
 Um, you know the digital binary data that this system uses

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.120
 um

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.080
 so

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.080
 Some point in the near future. I really

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:49.200
 Want to dive into that and just kind of figure out what it is and how to take advantage of it

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.120
 Yeah, you should if anybody's gonna figure that out or get into it. It would be you

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.480
 It's definitely caught my attention. So I mean, I'm

00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:01.040
 You know at some point I may be getting perilously close to a chaos devices

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.600
 full fucking system like

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.400
 Chaos devices if you hear if you're out there listening

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.760
 And you need someone to qa your uh your shit

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:15.200
 Um just him. Yeah, give him a ball. I'm on board. Um, yeah

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.000
 I just I really like what they're doing in this and the sofia. I think

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.560
 it seemed like it was a

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.560
 if I wasn't already sort of

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.800
 Neck deep and oscillators already

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:29.360
 Um, I would definitely be definitely be checking this out. I totally forgot they even announced an oscillator

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:32.320
 I just remember they announced the two different

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:38.720
 Effects modules the one being the frequency shifter that I forget the name of but it caught my eye at the time

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:43.120
 And I was you know digging through all the super booth announcements

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:46.080
 Because I like me some frequency shifting. I do

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.960
 I have like 16 filters

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:53.920
 Yeah, holy shit. Wow bill like two last week. Oh nice

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:59.680
 The other thing on my list is actually a filter. Oh, yeah, okay. It's not super booth. It's not

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.400
 Do you want a 17th? Yeah

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.640
 this one actually

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.520
 I feel bad because

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.160
 I have nothing but good things to say about the filter. I'm about to

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.400
 We'll get through super booth first and then we can go and circle. I already want this filter

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.760
 Um, but yeah, so if he uh that was something that I

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:24.800
 I don't know. It may be one of those things weren't actually available. It will be difficult for me to

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.440
 resist, you know, it's it's

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.080
 It sounded it was making a lot of sounds that were

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.360
 Like, oh, I wish I had made that like

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.440
 That area of fucked up but still musical

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.600
 Um, I really dug it so time to flip some oscillators

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.320
 What the fuck am I?

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.560
 Enough. I like all the ones I have. I don't know

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:52.800
 I forget what you have a lot of digital ones. I got the bucla. What? I got the bucla from tip top. I got the

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:56.640
 quad operator. Yeah, plats. Yeah

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.680
 I can get rid of the graphic vco that would make some room

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.080
 Pissed it because you got you got her piston Honda. I'm gonna say you got the piston

00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:07.200
 So it's just a really graphic vco. Oh, yeah, you could buy another case

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.520
 Or just buy another case. I mean that that's inevitable. Yeah, I should just stop

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.000
 I'm saying dump the plats dump the

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.560
 graphic vco

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:21.920
 Think of this because you already got that digital territory covered. I do stuff. Yeah, you need a nice analog

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:29.440
 Sophia in there. Yeah sold you fucking solve this problem. Go through your gristleizer. Yeah, I can hear it in my head already

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:36.480
 Well, I just turned on a dime. I went from I may not get it to I'm probably gonna go home and pre-order thanks

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:39.520
 Wow success

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:42.160
 I'm I should not have brought that up

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.520
 But what filter should I buy?

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.520
 We don't have super booth

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.560
 The Pauli and play

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.320
 which

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:56.160
 It's kind of like on its own. We don't need to wrap that in the super booth shit. We can discuss that

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.960
 on its own

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.960
 Go into this filter

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:06.080
 Disappointed if you don't talk about it. So the filter I want to talk about is

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:09.440
 A filter of crows

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:16.560
 From Pittsburgh modular never heard of them yet. Well Pittsburgh is a city. It's in Pennsylvania the United States of america

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:20.320
 Where the shirt um it's a shit hole

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:26.800
 Don't come here. That's too fucking high already. Oh, you the workers. Yeah

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.320
 Any influencers stay out

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:34.880
 Um a big big t-shirt just as any influencer staff

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.840
 I would wear that. Yeah, I know you would

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:44.240
 Um, so this is another one of the experimental modules they did

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:48.400
 Um, this is like the new series. It was released alongside the wolf

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:53.280
 Which is a preamp slash vca that they released and the bat

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:59.440
 Which is a filter and vca need bill home more fine. Neither of them really caught my eye filter of crows though

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:07.280
 Um, it's a combination of the crows preamp that they released a while ago and then just basically fell off

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:13.040
 That's what that was preamp. Yeah, oh, um, and what it is is it goes up to 75 times gain

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.680
 But still somehow sounds clean like it doesn't just go off the rails

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.280
 um

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.240
 So it has that on and off you can turn on and off

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.880
 Um that preamp going in to

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:32.560
 Basically the update of their original filter. Okay. Um, and it's multi mode and each of them each of the modes high pass

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:40.000
 spam pass and low pass, um, can be toggle on and off and it's all process and serial. I mean in parallel parallel and

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.880
 CV for the residents, uh, the residents and the filter cutoff

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.680
 if that was it, I'd probably be

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:55.120
 Like lukewarm. I probably wouldn't even bring it up. It's something I just bought and didn't even mention, you know, like it's just

00:58:55.120 --> 00:59:01.680
 It would be exciting to get the crow that crow preamp. That was just basically unattainable

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.560
 Staring randomly exactly rip

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.600
 What's what blew my mind though is the stability parameter

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:15.600
 So when you turn it on or when you have it in stable mode, the it doesn't self oscillate

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:18.640
 It's the the resonance is stable

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:23.200
 When you turn this off when you basically let it go up it falls apart

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:26.400
 In the most amazing way possible

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:33.920
 Is it self oscillates, but it's dictated based on the value of the of the residents and the filter combination

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.400
 There are parts of

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:40.240
 As you're like sweeping between the residents where it stops making sound

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:44.720
 It completely just the entire circuit just disintegrates. It is

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.600
 wild

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:53.440
 And it's all done like all of this sort of like processing all of this sort of like what it's doing

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:59.360
 Is all in real time. So as you're sweeping with it the residents and the filter cutoff

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.520
 it's

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.920
 Going between these different modes and it's going through all the stuff and it responds to cv accordingly

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.240
 Kind of reminds me of like a plague bearer a little bit. Yeah

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.880
 And in fact there are like, you know, there's these spots where it like cuts out

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:21.200
 As you're sending cv you can actually try to send cv to get that effect

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.400
 And like the little edges like right before it cuts off

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.520
 Just squeal and squelch

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:32.960
 But like nothing ever has that sort of um like that joe mox m resonators

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.960
 What I always go back to where it was like

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.920
 Oh, this was this sounded really cool, but the gain just went up

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:42.560
 50 decibels everything is still relatively controlled. So even when you have

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.080
 The crow preamp cranked up to 75x

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:52.320
 This weird stability turned off and it's just going from like dead to squelch to like

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.200
 Back to smooth. It's just like a rumbling self-oscillating filter

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:03.120
 All of it is even keel like all of it's still usable. Like this is it's fucking fantastic

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.600
 I love it as like

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.400
 And you can also just like turn off the preamp turn stability back on and just use it as

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.520
 Their old their nice old filter like it does really simple stuff simple

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.840
 But then you can just make it just be this

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:25.040
 Absolutely bonkers machine. Oh, it's cool. You're selling me on this. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I haven't heard the demos or anything

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.800
 um

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.320
 But they have what you're describing kind of reminds me what I used to do with like a quad plague bear

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:38.080
 So with cv going in and out of like the dead zones and bringing it into like squelch territory very similar to making it just become like uh, you know

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.480
 Uh, just like the living creature. That's very similar

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.720
 Has that vibe of like as you're moving between these different states

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:53.680
 Things are the circuit sort of coming alive and then just can't handle it anymore and just vomit in front of you

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.840
 X game you said yes

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.640
 4 hp or something. It's like small, right?

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:05.680
 Um, it's made 10 maybe okay. It's the original crow was okay the original original

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.640
 This is a little bit bigger, but it's nowhere near as big as the original filter that they had

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:18.080
 Um, it's yeah, it does not take up a lot of room which was it like 220. I think okay

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.640
 It was not expensive either and I think it's still available

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.440
 Unlike those sort of early experiment ones that you know

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:29.360
 Are not they're not available anymore and it's funny because I went and talked I went and picked it up

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:35.440
 From bittsburgh modular and I was talking to okay. I actually have one now. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've had it. Yeah, I've had it for yeah, that was

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.480
 um

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.600
 had it for

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.280
 Oh, basically the day it came out. I basically like I remember saying you were going to the shop and yeah

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:49.200
 I couldn't remember what it was. It was good. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's organized. Well, it's not cramped

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.120
 But it's not taking up a lot of room

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.040
 Um, it's a little hard to read but honestly it's for like it's in

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:01.920
 Res CV filter cutoff CV helped what if you like filter slow little switches? Oh little switches are the modes

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.400
 So you can have high passes

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.320
 Yeah, and then you can have you select which ones are on and it's all in parallel

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:13.760
 Um, so even doing things like turning the low pass off and just having high pass and

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.720
 Banned pass and fucking with that just adds

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:22.160
 Just absurd character to just otherwise boring signals

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.400
 Um, but yeah, I went into um, I mean there's no reason for them to ship it

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.920
 They're a couple miles away and I went and I was talking to perry

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.080
 um, it was just

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.080
 A great human being. Yeah, I showed perry

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.920
 Yeah, seriously, uh

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.840
 And like showed me around the shop and you made that offhand comment. I'm like, oh, yeah

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:46.640
 Like I was really excited because the crow felt that original crow was going for like absurd prices on reverb

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:52.000
 And he's like, yeah, we just found out about that like they hadn't seen that this like

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.320
 Second like the like the the secondary market. Hmm for their limited

01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:02.640
 And they're like that's not why we would that's not why we did this it was not to create this sort of like boutique artificial scarcity

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.640
 It doesn't benefit them. Yeah, they're just like we just didn't think a lot of people would want it

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.040
 If more people want it will just make more, you know, like it was not I was a little put off by like the like

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.040
 Well, fuck. I'm not paying $900 for a hundred dollar module. Yeah, like I

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.360
 I don't know why in my head I was blaming them for this scarcity like, you know, but I'm like, no

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.840
 They just didn't know they didn't know that people were gonna want it and they're like, yeah, people want more

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.680
 We'll just make more like um, which I think is great. If you go to their site now

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.320
 That's all it is and stuff like this like there

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.120
 There are other module line is they don't have anything else. They're not doing they're like

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:43.120
 Like I think we even at one point called them like the us dope for yeah, they're not really doing anymore

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.560
 Because I think they probably realize that manufacturing isn't the most fun

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.720
 And that's why they do all that too with create an audio now

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.520
 I think they just make designs for create audio too

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.520
 Because it's a lot easier to sell designs than it is to like have to

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:02.080
 Get parts anymore and like be a manufacturer as a fucking nightmare. Absolutely. I'm one of strange coincidence that

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:06.080
 You know a business called Pittsburgh modular happened to be in Pittsburgh

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:13.760
 Still bends my mind. I think that really worked out in their favor

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.560
 It did yeah

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:23.280
 They even spelled it correctly with the h yeah, that would have been embarrassing if they they spelled it like a normal common faux pas

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.720
 Yeah, it is

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.400
 From outsiders

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.720
 So yeah, honestly, nothing but good things to say I think it's

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.280
 I love that it does the simple stuff simple

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.160
 And is also a bonkers

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:37.520
 Filtron top of that come into it. I'll have to check this out more

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.200
 And the other stuff like I said, I can't do a 303 to

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.800
 Is that like was that your three S right? Yeah

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.480
 It's more like

01:05:53.840 --> 01:06:00.240
 So listeners right in right in and tell us we thought was the better 303 Nick let's hear yours again

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:04.160
 Greg terrible

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:10.880
 All right, that's that's what those are your choices listeners, uh, and whoever, um

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:18.000
 Rights us the best essay we'll get a um, I don't know. What do we even have a free koozie free acid line?

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.960
 Oh wait, I just gave it away

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:29.920
 A free andrew one beatbox acid line

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.800
 Oh, we'll put his name on it for you

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:44.000
 That's basically the end of my list greg you said, uh, well nick was there anything on your list? Oh

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.880
 Complete overhaul of mixing and sequencing for me, which I don't have to get into and super depth

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.080
 But yeah, I do want to talk about the frappe tools

01:06:54.080 --> 01:07:01.040
 Creative mixer whatever the fuck is it called crap tools? I got the quad stereo channel craptals

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:07.200
 Frappe rules. I seriously heard crap crap tools crap tools. I heard fat tools fat tools

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.160
 different

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.240
 Um

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.240
 But yeah, I actually

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:18.960
 After live set prep for which played those two sets or tried to play two and the second one couldn't

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.720
 um

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.640
 Sat back in my studio and sat down to like use the modular and I was like wow

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.600
 This cosmic sounds fucking broken to me

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:33.600
 And it was like I love the cosmos. I don't know how I didn't notice this it may actually be broken to some extent

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.920
 Sorry person. I sold it to you already. Um

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.280
 But even with the

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:45.360
 Drive off I was just noticing this noise over tone for some reason like I hadn't sat down on my monitors for a while and I was like

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.200
 unacceptable

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.240
 um

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.080
 started looking at mixers

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.240
 Saw the frappe tools quad stereo channel because I was like oh I need all this stereo shit

01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:00.960
 I quote unquote don't want to pay for wm-d performance mixer even though I spent exactly that amount to get where I am with the

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.720
 frappe tools

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:09.040
 Um, but I'm not mad at that actually thin they because it doesn't have as many stereo inputs the wm-d has like eight

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:13.440
 And then two mono or something like that, which is pretty sweet and vca's on those

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.160
 But the frappe tools has like four channels that you get

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.400
 But it's actually a little more than that because you can get cv

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.640
 Um on the effect sense, which is cool

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.240
 You get it on one on each end on the quad stereo channel because of panel space

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.880
 But then I got the group

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.080
 Module that connects to the master module. So with this frappe tool shit

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.400
 There's always a channel a group and a master

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.760
 What I didn't figure out at first because their manual is thorough

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.000
 But really confusing is that you need a group channel to connect this master module

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.240
 And I was like, oh, I just want two more stereo ends. I want to add another channel. How do I do that?

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:49.520
 I realized this group does that because it's super flexible

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:56.080
 And the group is just like say take any of these output channels like these four that I got in this quad stereo channel

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.320
 And it will sum them all

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.320
 In stereo and let you have another effect send on the group and that's fully automated

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.960
 And so you actually can use the effect send out

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:09.280
 On the quad stereo channel because it's a little mixer and on this group also

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:14.480
 Um, but the one, you know affects the um group itself and the other one individual channels

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.720
 But you don't get as much cv

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:21.440
 But you get two effects ends with mono out stereo returns under this group channel

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.320
 Which is the thing that saves me two channels question in the room. I have a question. How do you specify a group?

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:30.240
 Oh, uh group is just a thing that aggregates channels

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.120
 So it's actually only one type of module you can get and then you can actually have multiple groups

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.240
 Um into this master channel. So you're gonna have a total of 128 channels if you want

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.480
 Holy shit if you buy enough of these things

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.840
 Um, so I just wanted the quad at first and that worked and that had its own master out

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:54.560
 Then I was like, oh just like another to get rid of like somewhere to put my effects returns would save me would be perfect

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.880
 That's when I realized the group was out there

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:02.320
 But like it was really hard to get and so I saw somebody on reverb had both of these modules used in california

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.320
 This master channel the older skinnier one that doesn't have the quarter inch outs and just has eighth which is totally fine

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.880
 Um, and then this other group

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.880
 So I got those two because they were like cheaper and available and it was the only way to get them

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:22.080
 And this shit sounds fucking great. It is the nicest mixer i've ever heard in euro rack by far

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:25.920
 Um, can't get the thing to fucking crackle in any way like it's just

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:30.720
 Sounds fucking dead on this also this um master output has a headphone

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.800
 output um dedicated which was also attractive to me because I was using like the

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:41.040
 Intel gel 7u with the converter and i'm like there's no good level control and it's also the master and i was like it would be cool to just have

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.800
 headphone out and um

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.280
 That sounds really cool too and having two cv controlled effects sends

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:50.080
 Um with returns has been like

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:56.880
 fucking mind but for me um it's i'm doing all this shit with effects that I wasn't doing before because I have the cv controller of the ox outputs

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.280
 Um, you can cv the returns too and just use those as dedicated you can say

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.880
 I don't want to return anything here. I'm just going to use you as a stereo channel

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:13.120
 And they have vca's on them as well. So those are stereo vca's if you want them to be because you can control the level of the return coming in and the ox coming out

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.120
 So it's like really flexible

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:19.120
 And this quad stereo channel each channel has its own vca input too

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.200
 So kind of like the wmd performance mixer

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:26.960
 And you can just you know put an oscillator in stick and envelope and like use this to output a sound and have an effect on it

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.600
 Now it's not generally how I roll because I want to then like route that through something else and then you'd have to like

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.480
 There's no direct outs on this mixer. Um

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:40.320
 Which is fine by me, but like it's doing exactly what I wanted as far as getting the mix together

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.520
 Um the mute buttons are located like in the perfect spot

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.640
 It's like right below the knob and you look at it. You're like, oh, that's kind of dumb

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:52.480
 And then you use it and you're like, oh, it's the fucking perfect spot. It's like right there. There's nothing that can get in the way of it

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.400
 um

01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:00.160
 I was I think you mentioned it too like that frapp tool shit. It looks confusing as fuck when you see that. I was like, what is this

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.200
 It's a colorful. It knows a mixer. There are lines going everywhere. It's like a math not clear

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.800
 Yeah, yeah

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.800
 If you look they have like a math's called the foulest tree or something like that and it's like

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:16.000
 Crazy it looks intimidating, but like this is one thing where you sit down in five minutes

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.360
 It's like oh it's just two effects sins in a fucking pan

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:25.600
 The cool thing is um, you've got stereo channels you there's a switch so you can change it from pan to cross fade

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:33.280
 So you can use those stereo channels as two mono inputs so you can cross fade an oscillator or you can just have two mono inputs

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.600
 Um, especially if you don't need the vc

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:40.560
 Yeah, and that's when I realized like oh shit. This is like a very flexible fucking mixer because the way they have it said

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.360
 I like voltage controlled caters. Yeah voltage controlled faders voltage control. How's the same?

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.040
 Is it like

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.000
 negative five to plus five? I think I think it's

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.640
 Oh god. I don't remember. I think it's bipolar

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:58.000
 Plus five. I think that's what it is as it should be. Yeah, no, it definitely didn't

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.320
 I suppose I didn't have to rectify anything to get it to like work. Oh really anything like that

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.000
 Oh

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.520
 Sounds fantastic as I said that was the thing that was most impressive like so far like

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.480
 Even though my italicel seven you on the output i've got to like

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:16.160
 Move it back and forth a few times before I play so I can get it to not crackle and like my cause mix

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.360
 Um wasn't too bad

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.840
 But other mixers that I've had have been like really crackly and shitty like that befaco

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:28.320
 St mix those are garbage. Um those pots are garbage on those. They just don't work all of them are fucked up

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:33.440
 But this was like perfect. Um, it's actually kind of a small size. Actually in the end

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.000
 I didn't need the master out that has the headphone

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.600
 I like the headphone, but that's the part that I could kind of skip. Um because the other ones have stereo outs anyway

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:47.840
 It's like another level control. Oh, the master gives you another stereo input, but it's on like an eight-inch stereo

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.240
 It's just like this thing like oh if you went in live, I would just run my rhythm into that

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.640
 Yeah, because it's got its own level control. Um

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.720
 So it kind of hit like all the boxes of what I was looking for from mixing

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.240
 Does it have like a meter like a visual indicator?

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:07.360
 It's got a beautiful meter on the master one, but it's also got meters on the

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.960
 stereo outs of the group and the quad stereo channel and it's got meter LEDs on the vca's

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.600
 and meter LEDs on the

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:22.640
 What are they're out the ox out? So it's actually the one module I've used where it's like oh, I actually

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.880
 Know where all my levels are and I know where to change them. I'm like oh that vca's too hot

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:32.080
 Like this is like it's been really nice. Um because normally you just get like maybe

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.640
 Um an led that's the brightness of the led to give you an indicator

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.040
 Um, and you have to use your outboard mixer

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.720
 To figure out what the actual level was if it was too hot like this is like they nailed that in this regard

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.480
 So it's cool and like it all chains together with like um

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:54.960
 IDE cables behind it like you know, yeah power cables. So it's it's pretty slick the way they did it

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.240
 Um

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:03.040
 I'm impressed. I don't want any more of it. I could see adding another single stereo channel that they make if I need that

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.080
 Um

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.640
 No, I'm just didn't anything else. They make the brenzo, which is the dual oscillator. They make looks really cool

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.960
 But it's huge. Um, and it's apparently awesome

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.200
 And I turned out it turns out like some people would just like love their gear cult style

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.880
 Like this is like the new bucla. I like like a few people i've seen like that

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.440
 eardrill dude cbm on

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.440
 um mod wiggler

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.960
 Has said like yeah, I love this stuff just as much as bucla and he's got a bunch of it

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.480
 always actually

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:34.160
 Really into the demos i've heard of their spectral processor that I call the fumana. Yeah. Yeah

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:40.080
 One one really bad. It looks amazing. But yeah, it's like 900 bucks. Yeah, it's not cheap

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.520
 The spotnik was cheaper and kind of scratches that it's room but the fumana looks fucking cool

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:52.160
 It does like all this shit. I bet sounds amazing based on how this mixer is. I bet everything they make sounds fucking great

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.120
 Yeah, and it's got this beautiful kind of like

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.600
 Shitty almost purple color panel and I really like it very nice like

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:04.320
 Kind of shitty purple mixers. Well, they're really good mixers that have like a kind of shitty purple

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.600
 But I got rid of the vortices also

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.160
 Because after that it was just like, okay. This is way too much mixing

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:17.200
 Yeah, it just seemed ridiculous and I just never use it. Yeah the vortices

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:24.560
 I still have oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm kind of falling out of favor with it though

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:29.120
 You the og right not the og. Yeah, not the high five still low five

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.960
 but like the amount of

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:35.200
 Sends and ins and outs that it has has always been good to me and like you're saying like, you know

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.760
 There's so many shitty sounding mixers out there

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:44.160
 Um or ones that just crackle or do strange things or have strange noise floors the vortices

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:47.840
 Has always been pretty solid for me. It's just the fact that like

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:54.640
 Um, it's my only mixer currently and then you know everything you put into it kind of it gives that low five flavor

01:16:54.640 --> 01:17:00.000
 Which I don't always want right. That was mine. Right. Yeah, and also I have never had any

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.200
 need

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:09.040
 To lower the volume of the inputs on that thing right like you kind of want it to be at max volume

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:15.440
 Because that's when it sounds the best. Yeah, but you kind of need like a mixer after that. I ran into that too. You know, I mean

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.240
 Yeah, exactly. It's like I always have it cranked up. I'm like, okay

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.800
 That's where these channels sound best, but now I need to lower the overall volume

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:26.960
 You know what I mean? So it's like yeah, it's it's not a good

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:31.120
 Stand-alone mixer. It like needs to be used with other mixers

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:36.560
 Still just draws me nuts to the different mono and the stereo mixer levels or different types of knobs

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.880
 But it uses the other knob for the pan and it's just like I color-coated mine

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.280
 So it is smart. I did the same on the cosmos too because oh, yeah

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:50.000
 I kept writing into that with the cosmos. I put the trimmer toppers on the ox ends on the cosmos

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.800
 Yep, go to the person getting that getting those off if you want to it's impossible

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:58.400
 Two pieces of posse you really fuck this person

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.120
 It's a rope you're getting these fucked up knobs. Did you shit it at two?

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:08.080
 I shipped it to them on time before they left the country and they gave me five stars feedback

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:13.840
 Wow, but you can't take that back can't take back five stars feedback on reverb. No takes these backses. No

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:20.000
 No, it is fine. I was probably being really anal and picky like no the cosmos is noisy

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.560
 It is I don't know how I didn't really hear it before I think I was just trying to do something clean for once

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:30.000
 I was like, honestly, I was actually surprised that you liked it as much when you go

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.400
 Yeah, because like I got it and I noticed it was noisy

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:38.640
 But I was using it more or less like a stereo mixing distortion effects not so much as just a standard mixer

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.960
 And I was like, yeah, surprised to hear that like you were okay

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:46.480
 I was like, okay, maybe he's making some grimy stuff, but like yeah, there's definitely it's hard to get around

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:52.400
 Sort of like the fortices like it's it's an effects mixer. You know what I mean

01:18:52.400 --> 01:19:18.980
 It is not in my opinion at least it's adding carot

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.980
 But there was a thing I got it and it was the first mixer I had that like nailed it feature-wise

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:29.700
 So I was like, oh, this is like everything I want kind of and then I liked the master output saturation a lot

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.180
 Absolutely

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:35.940
 And I'll miss that actually I would like to buy that just as a stereo processor with just those two sliders

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:37.220
 100% I agree

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:41.620
 And that would actually satisfy it for me because that usually sounded really good especially live

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:44.260
 Um, that sounded good

01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:48.420
 I miss mine as well. I swapped it out for the vortices because I didn't have enough rock space

01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:53.940
 It's time for like, you know two mixers, but I wanted more stereo sends and stuff like I was like, well

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:58.260
 I think the cosmic's got to go gonna go with the vortices, but now I kind of wish I had both

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:04.020
 But the wrap tool is like pretty much close to like the nicest mixer I've ever heard period

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.020
 Yeah, just how hard how

01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:09.620
 Do you feedback that shit yet? No input. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:14.900
 Actually, I noticed because it does some like cancellation kind of or something with feedback

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:19.860
 Because I was just feeding you know typical like I'll take the aux end and feed it back to itself kind of thing

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:24.740
 Um, it would like cancel and I was like, oh, it's like we face cancellation. Yeah, I think so

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:29.540
 I feel like I made a note to like go back to that but at the point I was just working on a thing

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:35.860
 Yeah saturates nicely when you drive it to like good shit

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:38.740
 Wow, yeah, they killed it

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.340
 Is this um

01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:47.300
 difficult to find the quad stereo channel is easy to find and actually I would say that that's the only one you really need

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:49.060
 Um

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:54.900
 They designed it so that was standalone and I think that was smart because really that's the only like it's nice to have the other

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.900
 stereo shit now the

01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:58.660
 um the ability to do

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:02.180
 The cb controlled sends on everything on that buster that grouping of everything

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:05.380
 But I could get rid of those two and still be just as happy not sure

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:09.060
 It's very intriguing. Yeah, it's good shit

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:11.700
 Greg

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:16.420
 Greg is there something Greg is there something you wanted to talk about Greg? That's me Greg. That's me

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:18.420
 Is there something you want to talk about me?

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:21.620
 Uh, that is you I did want to mention the poly and play

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:24.580
 What about it because

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:27.860
 At first I was very indifferent to it same. I

01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:33.620
 I don't I'm gonna call bullshit. I'm pulling a card. Oh, you're you were not just indifferent

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:40.340
 Uh, yeah, you gave it you gave it some shit. I was oh, yeah. I was yeah. I think we all were I think we all did

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:42.340
 I'm playing my uh

01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:45.780
 Your your true feelings. So we'll change your mind because I have um

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:50.340
 Not really revisited this in all I see uh influencers

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:54.980
 Oh my god. Was it Andrew hollang? It was not uh, it was Ben Jordan

01:21:54.980 --> 01:22:03.140
 I do love Ben Jordan. He posted a cool little artistic creative video. He did a cross-country drive

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:06.020
 He had a go-to meeting on the west coast he drove from like

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:07.700
 Florida

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:10.340
 California and back and he decided he was just going to bring

01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:13.140
 the poly and play which he got

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.940
 You know to to demo

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:21.220
 Just it and no like synth or anything outside just the play just the play just the play

01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:22.740
 That's bold

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:23.700
 um

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:28.340
 And he was doing field recording to get his sample material like it stops that he made along the way

01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:29.460
 I

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:36.100
 Don't think he ever specified if he recorded it into the play. I don't remember if the play has recording capabilities or a microphone or anything

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:41.380
 I I'm gonna assume he used like a field recorder and then just jumped it in there. I think so but either way like that

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:45.060
 Yeah, that was his only piece of gear that he took with him. Um

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:48.340
 And when the video you know when he first

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:53.700
 Started it. I was still skeptical of the play and I was still skeptical of this video. I'm like, okay, whatever

01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:56.580
 This is just him chilling for this piece of gear

01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:01.140
 I will step in and say we've seen him do that in the past. Yeah, with that empress

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:06.180
 Yes, um, that was the thing that I was like, oh, this is this is painful to watch

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:11.060
 Yeah, like going out on the desert. Yeah, and he was on the desert and it was just I hated that video

01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:15.460
 Yeah, that was that was just like such a bladen attempt of trying to turn a

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:21.220
 Product that was kind of boring into I don't know dramatic and and and spiritual

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:25.780
 The same with this one, but he sold me on it this time around right. Um, so he learned the mistakes

01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:29.220
 From the previous one visually for sure like he went to like abandoned malls

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:35.060
 And like oil drills in the middle of the desert field like the type of visuals that like I like to see

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:39.060
 Especially on road trips and I went there and he just like recorded sounds and then made some like lo-fi

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.580
 Idmish beats using the sounds and with the stuff

01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:46.740
 Uh within the play. Mm-hmm. And I was like, you know, it's kind of cool

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:51.940
 Like I can see the usefulness of this, you know in this application being like a stripped down

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:57.380
 You know piece of gear, but at the same time I was like I still don't need another group box

01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:03.540
 Especially one that looks like a monom on crack or some mutant variation of the tracker

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:07.700
 Which I already very much like so I'm like, why do I need to play? Yeah

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.660
 If I like the tracker

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:12.660
 But he started to show off

01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:16.020
 Later in the video when he got past the artistic visual stuff

01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:20.740
 Um a more slightly technical overview and showed off that it has

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.780
 a lot of like generative functions and some of the

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:30.500
 Magic that the tracker has and more when it comes to generating sequences or events

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:36.020
 Or probability and things like that and I was like, okay. Now you're getting me here

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:44.900
 Like the play won't be out for months and months. Oh no shit. Yeah, so they're just like for some reason polyend is like

01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:49.940
 All gas no breaks with the marketing hype right now. You know what I mean? Like weird

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:55.060
 Yeah, and it's it's weird to see so many influencers get this thing and like hyping it up

01:24:55.060 --> 01:25:01.300
 So far in advance and you know it kind of turned me off to it a bit too, but like yeah the ben jorin video

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:06.420
 Broke through that, uh, you know a version that I had got me to pay attention to it

01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:08.420
 So then I watched some of the other videos

01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:12.100
 Lou pops and stuff like that and I'm like, okay, no this thing is

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:16.900
 I'm starting to see the usefulness of it for sure and so when you're saying generative

01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:24.260
 Like where is it is it generating in in sequences and generation modulation? Like where's where are you getting that sort of with?

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:27.140
 sequencing and probability, okay and

01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:32.980
 Microsteps stutters things like that it had it can do some of the events that you can do in the tracker

01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:34.980
 Right some of the effects events

01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:36.100
 with like

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:40.020
 You know stutter steps and fade in fade outs those type of things and

01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:43.060
 Things that are fucking tedious to do in a doll

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:48.420
 Things that are tedious to do or impossible to do on a lot of your vanilla

01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.660
 Sequencers, you know what I mean?

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:53.060
 Which is one of the things that made the tracker stand out to me

01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:56.980
 Right, but a lot of that stuff in the tracker can be then sent out as midi

01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:02.500
 Which you can in this as well. So then what again going back to your original point. Why do I want this over?

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:07.140
 A tracker I mean you kind of stepped on my question, but yeah, that's exactly my question

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:09.540
 um

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:13.860
 Mainly because you're not hard stuck into the vertical tracking

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:16.340
 um

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:21.860
 Style of sequencing which you know you can turn that sideways, right? Yes. Okay, which is what you're doing

01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:24.340
 but no, it gives you a nice like

01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:27.300
 easy

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:31.620
 Interface that you can punch things into on the side like you have all your presets and stuff on the right

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:34.900
 Uh, with you know, the I think it's the last four

01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:40.180
 Of the buttons on that grid and then beside that, you know, you got your step sequences

01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:41.860
 It's

01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:45.220
 More visual where you can see everything. Yeah all at once, you know, I don't know

01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:52.420
 Definitely like xox style, which is done to death, but it seems like they added some interesting aspects to it

01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.180
 um

01:26:54.180 --> 01:27:01.460
 Kind of like what you see in like a deluge. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it's worth things. You know, I mean so it seems like it's a mix of

01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:05.540
 Uh like a tracker and a deluge

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:09.380
 And that is exciting even like some of the seven oh seven thing

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:12.980
 Yeah, I mean that's really exciting because I still use this shit out of my deluge

01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:15.220
 And I love it to death and I use a lot of

01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:19.700
 the that those sort of things especially with live because it adds a little bit of

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:22.900
 Variety that is difficult to do

01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:29.540
 On the line record like do field recording with a deluge, correct? You can resample and you can do looping and you can

01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:32.420
 Uh just record live into it. I'm wondering it

01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:36.260
 I'm curious if that's what he did. Maybe he mentioned that and I missed it, but yeah like

01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:38.900
 his use of like the

01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:40.260
 Found sound

01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:45.140
 In his little demo. I'm curious if he was able to record that right into the play if so, then yeah, I think that would

01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:48.660
 I mean amazing blur the lines even more between that and a deluge. Yeah

01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:54.500
 Um some of the generative shit that was like well beyond what the tracker it is. It's doing some weird

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:58.100
 You know like AI shit and I'm like, okay

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:04.180
 First it seemed like a gimmick to me and like I like generative generative things, but not when it does it all

01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:08.340
 For me, you know, I mean I like coming up with the same complex change of generative events

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:13.220
 I want control over what exactly it's going to end up doing even if I'm not controlling each piece

01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:18.820
 I want to set it in motion. Sure. That's the thing and it seemed to me like this might

01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:23.300
 Let you do that. That's cool. You know, I mean like you can control the level of

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.500
 generative stuff that you want to do with each track

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.780
 Um now are they going to go down the electron path of like

01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:34.100
 Not including that in the tracker so that it can be exclusive to play

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:38.420
 I don't know that's no question really rad if I could get that in my tracker

01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:41.940
 Well, that's what brings me back to my initial aversion to this

01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:46.180
 Whole device in the first place was that like again as a fan of the tracker

01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:53.860
 I was not expecting polyen to be announcing a whole new device. I was expecting them to announce tracker version two

01:28:54.580 --> 01:29:01.220
 And I wanted to see things like, you know more generative things like that. I wanted to see stereo stereo sample

01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:03.860
 Processing I wanted to see

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.540
 Um

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:10.180
 There was another big one that that oh like a drum engine. Yeah, yeah, that'd be awesome

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:15.540
 Unfortunately, I still don't think the play has I think this is strictly samples which is kind of like as far as I know

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:20.500
 That's as far as I can tell it to yeah, it is it has no drum engine like no

01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:27.860
 It still doesn't seem that different from tracker. I like it doesn't I keep coming back to like this doesn't scream necessary

01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:32.660
 It's more like button grid driven, you know, it's a different path to the same

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:35.220
 Yeah, okay

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.500
 Or

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:41.220
 Something that would accommodate a tracker or maybe it is for like people that are like I just didn't grok

01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:48.420
 The the tracker vertical scrolling thing. They want to get I had that discussion with my cousin. Yeah, he has a tracker

01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:54.500
 I you know, I convinced him get because he was turned off by the whole tracker, you know vertical sequencing thing at first too

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.820
 He's a very hip-hop dude, you know, I mean

01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:02.500
 And he is trying to program a lot of hip-hop stuff on it and he does like he's a drummer

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:07.380
 So he's in a finger drumming also and he says it's like near impossible for him to do

01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:13.380
 Certain things on those tiny ass buttons on the track. Sure. Yeah, but he said the play seems really

01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:18.900
 Catch his attention for that. He says it seems to be like like all the stuff that he likes in a tracker

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.980
 But on a you know a much more drummer friendly interface. I'm like, yeah, I can see that

01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:25.140
 um

01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:28.260
 I don't do finger drumming. So I don't give a shit about that. Yeah, but

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:30.900
 um

01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:33.540
 But the fact that you still can only manipulate

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:42.100
 mono samples is kind of a deal breaker for me and the fact that there's no drum engine kind of blows my mind still because there's other competing

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:47.380
 Trackers out there like the M8 and things like that that have yeah an FM drum engine

01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:53.940
 And it's like I kind of hate being stuck to just doing samples. So like I don't know the the play has my attention

01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:58.020
 But yeah, I hope that between now and when it comes out that they offer

01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:02.180
 The ability to drop stereo files in there

01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:10.500
 Yeah, and release like an FM drum machine of some sort of thing too is I don't really like the tracker effects

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:14.820
 I think they're kind of shit like the actual audio. Yeah, the actual audio effects

01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:17.700
 I think the reverb is okay. I think it's shit

01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:23.460
 I would love to see a really a revamp of a lot of those audio effects on the tracker. I

01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:25.700
 But I do love shitty reverbs though

01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:31.220
 It's the clouds reverb, isn't it? I think it is inspired by holly verb. Yeah, it inspired by it

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:38.020
 But I think it's I honestly I I think it sounds like shit. I would love to see like more ollie verbs sounds like shit

01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:44.020
 Yeah, but like I it has its charm. Yeah, that's fair. I don't find it charming

01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:47.700
 I would that's something I would like to see is a

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:51.060
 an improvement and a more for a wider variety of

01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:57.380
 Effects, yeah, and really taking those well that too. That's something that again like I was really home for a tracker too

01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:59.860
 Yeah, don't have that type thing, you know, I mean just like

01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:03.780
 Everything that the tracker currently lacks on or you know missing or

01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:11.300
 I don't want 0.5 of the they are there. I mean they're they're doing work on right that original hardware and each

01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:15.300
 Each version has a you know pretty big amount of

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:21.620
 Changes more effects in their better effects and a fucking FM drum machine into the tracker. The thing would be the ultimate

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:28.660
 Same with the play, you know, I mean like if I think that would really sell me if they started adding those types of things to it

01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:29.860
 but

01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.060
 But I'm not

01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:36.420
 Nearly as adverse to as I was at the beginning. I can kind of see its usefulness now. Yeah for drum programming. I think like

01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:39.060
 Strictly program. Yeah, yeah

01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:43.380
 Really appreciating things with a little more focus lately that don't do everything in the world

01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:46.660
 So I can see that especially as compared to somebody who like

01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:52.900
 Just tried to use the seven MC 707 and like that whole thing which did like everything poorly

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:56.580
 I'm appreciating things that do at least a couple as well

01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:58.580
 *music*

01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:00.580

01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:02.580

01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.580

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.580

01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:14.580

01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:16.580

01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:18.580
