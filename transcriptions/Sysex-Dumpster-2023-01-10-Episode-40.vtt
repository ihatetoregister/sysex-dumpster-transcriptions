WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:22.180
 - What episode is this Greg?

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.980
 - Episode 40.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.240
 - Big 4-0.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.080
 - Big 4-0.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.820
 - Lordy Lordy, look who's 40.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.260
 - God you said it, I was gonna say it.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.100
 - Yeah.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.680
 - They still have those billboards every once in a while.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.600
 You'll come across one.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.880
 And it's like the picture of the person whose birthday it is

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.440
 and like black balloons, like they're dead.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.840
 - I remember my mom's,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.840
 'cause my grandpa got this pretty good troll

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.320
 and he had a box in this bird feeder

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.080
 that was in the front yard that said Lordy Lordy,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.440
 Mary's 40, my mom's named Mary,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.480
 but it was like full of like bricks.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.000
 So it was like super heavy,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.800
 like make you feel even older.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.280
 He was good at trolling and shit like that.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.540
 - Episode 40 and it's our 2022 wrap up.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.760
 - Yeah.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.160
 - Couple days into 2023.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.000
 - Yeah.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.080
 - For me this was probably the longest year of my life.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.360
 I genuinely like think back of like what I was doing

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.200
 a year ago.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.040
 - Yeah.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.880
 - I'm like not even that person.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.280
 - I think same.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.080
 - That might just be psychological

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.840
 'cause I think it was probably still 365 days.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.120
 - No, no, I counted.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.640
 It was something like 7,000 days.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.880
 I could be off here or there.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.720
 - Yeah.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.200
 This one there was a lot of like upside,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.920
 but there was hell of a lot of challenges

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.440
 never been sick that many times in my life.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.560
 Like, goddamn, especially December was kind of a brutal

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.000
 tour de force.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Some good high notes like, but man, fucking brutal year.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.120
 - Mine's a blur.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.240
 It really is.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.480
 I feel like this did go by pretty quickly for me.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.840
 As far as music shit goes,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.600
 it was a very, I want to say productive year.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.120
 It was a year of growth.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.960
 - Same year.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.920
 - Same year.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.760
 Felt a lot of inspiration this year

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.760
 to work on shit and not just buy and sell modules

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.040
 or cycle them through my way.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.880
 - Yeah.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.480
 - Which I did my fair share of for sure, but.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.320
 - We both did.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.160
 - Yeah.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.000
 - But I feel like by the end of the year now,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.680
 I've reached a good balance and being very productive

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.160
 with what I'm trying to do in the studio.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.920
 So yeah, wasn't all for not.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.520
 - Yeah, realized as I was kind of reviewing today,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.240
 like some of the changes in the past year,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.120
 I was like, wow, you changed a lot of shit

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.040
 and cycled it out.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.160
 Went back to like where I was a little bit before.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.920
 And I'm not mad at any of it.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.440
 They were all pretty good choices, but I don't know.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.280
 I don't think it's going to be this volatile next year for me.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.080
 That's like one of my personal predictions I'll make.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.920
 - Absolutely.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.080
 - I'm really happy with this shit.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.320
 I have it on like a money's got to go elsewhere.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.560
 I need like new stoves, you know,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.080
 tons of shit that I should get

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.640
 instead of like another sampler or something like that.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.440
 - Yeah, I started to have that same revelation

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.880
 a few months back and my purchases definitely started

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.200
 to go down.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.000
 And yeah, it's going to be even more of that in 2023,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.840
 I think.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.240
 I'm going to have to sink some money into house stuff.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.080
 - Mm-hmm.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.560
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.400
 And to be honest, there's just not a whole lot

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.640
 that's inspiring me to open my wallet right now.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.480
 - Same here.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.320
 - Yeah.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.160
 - Yeah, it's like.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.480
 - And the things that I do want are either too damn expensive

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.960
 or too hard to get a lot of times lately.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.320
 So that actually ties in with our prediction

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.960
 from last year around this time when we did our wrap up.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.560
 So did you go back and listen to it and listen to it?

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.040
 - I listened to the parts, yeah.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.920
 - And it was still kind of fresh in my head too

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.760
 'cause the things that we were talking about,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.560
 we've talked about a couple of times throughout the year also.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.720
 - Hybrid systems.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.800
 - Year of the hybrid was our big prediction.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.640
 - Mm-hmm.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.240
 - We were talking about how some manufacturers

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.440
 would probably go under, some big ones and they did.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.240
 We were talking about how things would become hard

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.440
 to get inexpensive and that's exactly what has been happening.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.320
 And we touched on all that again

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.400
 in our modular dystopia episode.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.240
 - Yep.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.080
 - Not that long ago.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.640
 So, 'cause we don't need to beat that point

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.720
 into the ground or anything,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.080
 but there's definitely nothing on the horizon

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.280
 that suggests that's going to change.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.360
 - Anytime soon for 2023, so it's gonna be more,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.760
 a lot more of that.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.040
 - I don't wanna make this prediction,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.880
 but I think it'll get worse again.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.400
 I think a lot of people are gonna ship doing this part time.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.920
 - Hope that's not the case,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.160
 but I don't see that letting up.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.160
 - Yeah.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.520
 - So I've got a twist on this.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.800
 - Yeah. - One of my predictions was,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.480
 and this is only because of watching them on Instagram

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.320
 and getting their emails and basically watching them

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.200
 sort of struggle for a while,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.040
 and then this seems to be like right now

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.520
 on the cusp of them solving all the problems

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.600
 they've been having for a couple of years now

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.960
 and finally delivering, and that's LZX.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.440
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.280
 - Truth.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.360
 - They ended the one line, then that became unobtainium,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.720
 and then a couple of the new things actually made it out.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.520
 A lot of stuff that was supposed to come out

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.240
 a little while ago, but then there were struggles

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.720
 for various reasons.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.640
 Basically, the new lineup looks like

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.040
 it's on the cusp of coming out.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.880
 - Yeah.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.400
 - You know, secondary market for LZX stuff

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.240
 is astronomical now.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.480
 It's really out of control,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.400
 and this will hopefully ease that

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.680
 by having the TBC2 coming out, Chromalodeon.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.520
 - Chromalodeon. - Chromalodeon.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.560
 - Chromalodeon, thank you.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.800
 Chromalodeon, wow.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.200
 - Yeah, isn't that some band?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.800
 - It is a band from Philly in the early 2000s.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.880
 Definitely not what I meant.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.720
 They were good, they were good.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.080
 I mean, if they're listening.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.920
 - I think that's what you meant.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.760
 - Yeah.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.240
 - So to me, that's the one bright spot in all of this

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.240
 is a company that's stuck with it

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.400
 and is on the cusp of putting all this stuff

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.520
 into this market and making a modular video synthesis,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.760
 at least a little feasible again.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.920
 - Yeah, like if you pre-ordered a Chromalodeon,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.200
 you've probably been waiting two years for one.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.400
 If you've still hung in there,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.840
 they had to make a new line of modules

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.560
 so they could keep the company floating

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.000
 while they were waiting to produce TBC2

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.720
 and Chromalagden and the new line of shit.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.720
 But it sounds like they're about to ship TBC2,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.720
 which is huge, and they're saying Chromalagden

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.800
 is gonna be like spring vinyl,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.640
 which is also big for them.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.560
 - I'm very excited about TBC2 because I pre-ordered that

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.240
 like well over a year ago.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.280
 It's really a very fundamental,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.080
 fundamentally important part of the system

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.320
 that is going to make this a viable option

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.480
 for a lot of people that have been interested in videos,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.360
 since stuff, but have been keeping it in the box

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.480
 just because that was really the only alternative.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.560
 So I'm putting a twist on this doom and gloom

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.960
 and saying there's at least a sparkle of hope

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.240
 on the video synth front.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.080
 - People are getting creative.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.480
 Like, you know, Ross, we always usually mention Ross

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.120
 in an episodes and Ross got some new plans

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.480
 to be able to produce some stuff,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.200
 has shifted his strategy a little bit.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.240
 Seems interesting.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.080
 Hopefully people will keep being creative,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.440
 making shit, but.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.880
 - I mean, we should have Russ on sometime.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.720
 I know we've said that in the past,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.120
 but you know, talking about the designs that he has

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.320
 and what he wants to do,

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.120
 and also like the struggles that he's gone through,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.720
 keeping his line afloat.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.960
 - That's just kind of sparked an idea for me,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.800
 and I don't know if we could do like some episodes

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.440
 where it's like, "Sis X, Dumpster, and Friends,"

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.960
 and we could have maybe more than one person on

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.600
 to like kind of spread it out a little.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.840
 - Like crossfire.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.680
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.760
 - Like where we get like a Republican and a Democrat on,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.840
 and like, we're the moderators,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.080
 but they're like fighting and like,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.320
 it gets like heated and they're throwing shoes at each other.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.200
 - I'm sold. - Yeah.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.680
 - I don't know how to figure out

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.560
 who's gonna be the most like likely to start a fight,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.400
 but we'll figure it out.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.240
 We'll have a questionnaire.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.760
 - It'll become apparent. - Yeah.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.520
 (both laughing)

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.000
 - I like that idea though, yeah.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.840
 - We'll see where the year takes us.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.800
 - Patreons, let us know what you think of this idea.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.560
 - Yeah, 'cause I know you've mentioned this before

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.400
 and have kind of slowed a little more before Greg and I,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.160
 but I'm also in the position where I don't think

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.800
 I'm gonna have like a ton of new things to review next year.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.240
 So I'm kind of thinking about like,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.760
 but I don't know, I've picked up some things

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.840
 that are like, again, like I got another ornament in crime,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.600
 I'm using it differently and like some like random kits

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.880
 and like stuff like that.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.120
 So I might have some other shit to talk about.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.440
 - With the gnarled horse throat tape done and out

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.440
 and my ten inch done and out,

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.640
 I've got a clean slate right now.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.960
 One of my personal predictions is very similar,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.440
 maybe not getting a lot of new stuff,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.200
 but like trying new techniques, new things.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.240
 - Yeah. - Taking the stuff

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.480
 that I have and being like, all right,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.280
 don't just patch this like you normally do

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.040
 'cause there's a couple of routes that I go

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.560
 because I know they work, don't do that.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.400
 Do something different.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.840
 Like when I feel myself, I'm kind of going down the same path

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.000
 or the well that I go to all the time,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.320
 maybe stop and try something different.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.480
 So like McGordin said, change the process

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.880
 and you change the outcome.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.960
 Maybe I'll make music that people actually want to hear

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.280
 that way.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.960
 - But like a new old thing for me,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.680
 like I used to kind of hate these

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.120
 'cause I always had Beringer ones,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.040
 but I just got a patch bay again recently

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.000
 because I got this Octa track and follow up on that last,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.960
 yeah, the Octa track's pretty crucial for me now,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.360
 it's not leaving, it's just does its live set thing

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.880
 and that's it.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.080
 But I have it set up at home and I'm like,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.040
 oh, I can't really use this as well.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.480
 And like I have these hardware effects,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.160
 I'm not using my mixer anymore

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.920
 and I needed to be able to patch effects.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.000
 And so I saw a black line audio mix like patch bays now

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.720
 and I'm like, oh, they'll probably do a good job of it.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.080
 The Beringer ones, I had one of those like card ones

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.880
 and I always had like connection issues

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.080
 and I was like for a long time like fuck patch bays.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.200
 I don't wanna deal with noise issues, make it simple.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.000
 But I got this one and I'm actually gonna,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.720
 on the drive home I will pick up the patch cables

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.480
 that I needed for like balanced patch cables,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.200
 but I'm pretty excited to like integrate that in again.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.320
 Like it's been spurring some new ideas in my mind.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.160
 - I had a patch bay for a really long time,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.920
 but it was the noise and the crinkling and just,

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.800
 that's what kills me.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.720
 It was another one that had the cards

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.000
 which were really configurable.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.440
 I like that aspect of it, but I was like,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.000
 I'd rather just have one that does have like no bells

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.960
 and whistles.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.880
 This is a very simple device.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.720
 - Yeah.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.760
 - Make it as simple as possible,

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.920
 but make it absolutely fucking perfect.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.920
 - I think that's this black line audio one,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.240
 which was like 200 bucks, which is pretty fair price.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.680
 Like if you're gonna pay that for like firm and patch banks

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.000
 or like the 150 or something like that,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.600
 but it just has a button on the back to switch

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.000
 from normal and half normal.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.200
 And it's like, oh, okay, this is way better.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.480
 All that like leads are like gold plated.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.440
 It's like, oh, this is built like really well.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.280
 I bet it will not sound like shit.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.880
 'Cause the Beringer ones, they were a pain in the ass.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.360
 I mean, I hated them.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.080
 - I have a patch base sitting in my closet

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.240
 that I never even used.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.400
 - Oh yeah?

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.240
 - Is it a Beringer one?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.640
 - No, it's either the Furman or a Samson.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.360
 - Did you get that Samson for me?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.960
 - No, I got it from Sweetwater I think.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.280
 And then I got monthly calls asking about,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.160
 oh, I like my patch bay and I'm like,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.480
 bro, I haven't even patched it up.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.720
 Like I had it when I had more outboard effects.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.840
 Now I don't, like most of my effects are modular based.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.920
 So it's like I haven't needed the patch bay,

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.120
 but I should probably sell it honestly.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.920
 - Yeah, 'cause I was talking about it a couple months back

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.920
 and then I was talking to Ross about it somehow.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.480
 And Russ was like, oh yeah, patch mes are great.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.880
 He's like, mine just kind of makes like some noise sometimes.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.240
 And I was immediately like, fuck those things.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.160
 But past couple weeks, I was like,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.880
 oh, let me try this again.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.080
 So I mean, I guess this could segue into,

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.920
 we've got a bunch of categories for best or most of

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.840
 and I wanted to thank our Patreons,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.680
 especially in the last minute request over the last day or two,

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.400
 giving us some suggestions for categories for us to review

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.400
 or talk about, this is probably isn't the most exciting

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.240
 one to start with.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.840
 Probably this is a segue, talking about old and new.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.080
 Someone asked for the best resurrection

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.560
 of an old piece of gear.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.360
 And I wanted to point out for me,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.680
 the DSI Evolver is heavily back in the mix.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.880
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.400
 - I remember you were just kind of

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.240
 growing out of love with that thing recently.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.280
 Now you're back in?

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.680
 - Absolutely. - Rebound.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.240
 - Yes, it was, and it was like dusty.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.280
 Like it was seriously like kind of out of the way

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.600
 and hadn't been used in a while.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.440
 - Same one I told you right.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.280
 - It is the one from like--

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.120
 - It's like a dedicated guitar.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.960
 - Yeah.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.720
 I'm playing a live set in a couple of weeks

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.320
 and the Deluge has CV out, but also MIDI out in there.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.000
 Super channels and all those things.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.120
 Man, it'd be nice if I, in addition to just having

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.680
 the small modular setup, I had like a nice little sound

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.760
 module and I started looking around.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.480
 I was like, ah, that's cool, but the Evolver did that better.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.680
 Oh, that one's nice, but the way they did that

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.240
 and the Evolver better, and I brought it back out

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.880
 and like even some of like the old patches

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.480
 like I had saved, I'm like, oh, this still sounds good.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.320
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.120
 - So I don't really remember why it fell out of love

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.960
 with it.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.720
 I eventually figure out what it was,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.400
 why we would keep breaking up, but as of right now,

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.520
 yeah, very excited to dust that off,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.760
 bring it back into the mix.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.840
 - I was looking at those kind of recently.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.760
 - There was someone who posted the mono key version

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.160
 on Muff's just the other day and I was like,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.960
 fuck, that was like my dream since three years.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.040
 - Look used to have one.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.880
 - Really?

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.720
 - Yeah.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.560
 - I always wanted one.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.080
 They were like so hard to find.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.680
 And seeing that pop-up, I was like,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.200
 I really don't need that, but I fucking wanted like--

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.840
 - That's the one to get kind of.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.400
 - Yeah, it's got everything laid out.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.440
 Like that was my only, well, my biggest issue with

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.000
 the evolve and why I sold it in first,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.640
 but I didn't like the little grid matrix set up

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.560
 on the little module version, you know, sounded great.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.400
 I love the sound of it.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.000
 I just didn't like the interface.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.840
 - Yeah.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.640
 - The keyboard version seems to solve a lot of that.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.840
 - Yeah, so much is surfaced on that, yeah.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.400
 So that was getting the ball rolling.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.240
 - Yeah.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.160
 - That's my best resurrection.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.800
 We don't have to stick on this category.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.440
 I just wanted to seem like we were talking about old things.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.840
 - I'll go to the next, I guess.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.240
 I'm like knee deep back into Propellerhead's reason again.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.280
 - Yeah, I'm opening it.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.720
 I'm just using the reason rack version of it,

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.240
 which is really all I'm interested in

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.800
 'cause I don't like the DAW aspects

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.520
 that they've added to reason over the years.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.880
 Kind of ruined the program for me.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.720
 I like the fact now that you can open it as a VST

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.080
 and it's just like the rack.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.800
 So I've been using it like multiple instances of it

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.800
 within VCV rack and then routing my reason patches

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.920
 through VCV out my expert sleepers ES9 into my modular

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.120
 for like further processing.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.720
 And it's just weird to me 'cause reason,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.720
 especially like rebirth and things like that,

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.200
 like those were my first tools that I started playing with

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.600
 back in like 2000.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600
 - Definitely, same.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.200
 It's weird to be back in reason and not much has changed.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.840
 - You noted there's some new instruments,

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.160
 but it's like felt like riding a bike to me.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.120
 Like yeah, I used to spend hours upon fucking hours

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.960
 and reasons.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.480
 So like getting back in there and feeling comfortable with it

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.960
 and like actually being productive with it,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.320
 I was like, it's kind of strange

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.080
 that I've gone full circle in some degrees with it

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.360
 'cause like I hadn't touched it in years, you know?

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.840
 - I can't even imagine too because like similar

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.080
 like me at the time having no idea what to do.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.120
 Like this was entirely like the alchemy

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.840
 of twisting the opposite thing would happen.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.520
 And the idea of like actually having an intent

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.520
 versus just twisting the opposite thing would happen.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.360
 - Yeah, I mean like my experience with reason is what

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.040
 led me to like the modular path in the first place.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.400
 And the only reason why I understood how to work

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.880
 on certain sense, you know what I mean?

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.640
 'Cause like, you know, you had that familiarity

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.200
 with the hardware based interfaces of reason stuff

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.880
 and you know, mixing consoles and all that shit.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.880
 So like yeah, diving back into that now

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.160
 with even more knowledge, you know, it's interesting.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.520
 But for most part, it's still just me fucking around.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.360
 - Right.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.360
 - Like it's the new stuff that they've added to it

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.080
 very recently, I guess was oddly timed.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.840
 Like I wanted to start getting back into it

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.280
 and at the same time they've released like

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.680
 some really interesting shit for it.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.680
 Like the algorithm synth, which is just like

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.120
 it's a modular FM synth.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.800
 You can add modules to it.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.800
 There's wave table modules, filters.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.480
 It has like generative functions and like all this shit.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.920
 Something that reason should have had a long time ago.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.760
 - Yeah, sure.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.000
 - And glad to finally see that they're innovating

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 with it a little bit.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 But yeah, so yeah, dipping back into time

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.520
 and playing with software that I, you know,

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.360
 was very into 20 years ago now in a modern context

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.400
 because that would be my resurrection.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.240
 - Nice.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.160
 - It's a good one.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.520
 - For me, not a surprise, but Octatrack Mark II.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.000
 Especially after the last review, like I've got the levels

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.280
 kind of dialed in now.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.280
 Like it sounds good.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.680
 It was just, I couldn't have done that last live set

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.760
 in the same way without it.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.720
 And that was the live set since I've started

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.520
 that I felt the best about while playing it and after.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.960
 And it's just perfect for live.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.880
 I don't do anything crazy with the Octatrack.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.400
 I don't even really give too much of a shit

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.600
 about sampling anymore.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.080
 But as far as its ability to loop and affect

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.960
 two pieces of equipment in live, like it was just,

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.000
 it was so much fun because of the Octatrack.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.440
 And I was able to like do so much more.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.920
 All that muscle memory was there looping was seamless

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.160
 and worked perfectly live.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.920
 It was just like fucking sick.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.840
 So that'll never, now I won't sell that again

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.680
 as long as I'm playing like live sets basically.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.520
 And I don't plan to stop because there was even,

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.200
 the one for Andy thought I wasn't like super psyched

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.040
 on that live set.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.200
 I thought it was like kind of a secret effort.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.520
 I didn't represent myself very well

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.520
 with that last one that collision like got it.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.560
 That was the most fun I've ever had playing live.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.760
 - Well, someone who saw both of them,

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.160
 they were both great.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.360
 Yeah, they dug them both.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.400
 - Yeah, that's my resurrection.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.200
 So what about one of the next ones I think

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.040
 is a favorite sound source.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.080
 - So I'll start.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.920
 - Yeah, start too.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.680
 - I'm gonna start this up.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.680
 So for me in 2022, it was the the Bucla 258T,

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.920
 or the Tiptop 258T Bucla oscillator.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.760
 - Killer.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.560
 - I was interested in it.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.400
 We talked about it.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.080
 We talked about it in some of the stuff

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.080
 we talked about in the past.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.760
 So we don't have to deep dive too much into it.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.600
 I was interested in it.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.520
 I was like, "Let me give this a shot."

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.840
 Absolutely love it.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.680
 I think they nailed it.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.280
 I think it's more interesting than it has any rate to be.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.680
 - Yeah.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.360
 And yeah, two enthusiastic stereo output thumbs up.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.360
 - Stereo?

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.120
 - Well, it has two, it's not like actual stereo,

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.000
 but those malts are brilliant that it lends itself to.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.880
 Like a lot of different patching opportunities.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.240
 Highly worry, especially for the price,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.480
 it's like one of the best oscillators out there.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.360
 Analog for sure.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.000
 It's just fucking incredible.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.960
 - Great, your look, what is the look you're giving us?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.240
 - Because my answer is kind of not as sexy,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.600
 but it's an answer I'm probably gonna give

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.600
 in multiple categories, but mutable plates.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.440
 - Oh yeah.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.920
 - With the orange mode.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.000
 - So that was the thing is,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.840
 I didn't put that in this category

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.120
 'cause it's going to show up in another category

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.160
 and I didn't want to say plats over and over again.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.680
 - I'm gonna be saying plats over and over again.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.680
 - All right, that's fair.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.680
 - Plats, plats.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.840
 - I think it's plats.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.600
 Plats, plates.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.400
 - Yeah, I'm in love with that orange mode.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.280
 - Oh yeah, that's incredible.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.760
 - Yeah, it's, I know it's squeezing it in

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.680
 at the end of the year.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.360
 That was a nice end of year surprise,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.920
 but I can tell you right now I've enjoyed playing

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.240
 with that way more than like any other oscillator

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.600
 than I have throughout the year.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.680
 - Yeah, like most of my oscillator experiments

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.360
 this year were software based

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.720
 and they're all kind of boring.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.040
 And that was mainly intentional.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.000
 I spent the year avoiding complex oscillators.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.480
 I was trying to do more with simple sources.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.320
 - Yeah.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.600
 - I was trying to focus more on the processing and stuff

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.600
 and I feel like plates has always been a good Swiss army knife

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.600
 of simple, not super simple, but like,

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.080
 you know, simpler Swiss army knife oscillator stuff,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.000
 you know, duties.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.640
 And now the orange mode just breathes

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.840
 like a whole new type of vibe into it

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.880
 that I'm really digging, all the FM stuff.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.280
 - Yeah, the FM is especially incredible on that.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.600
 - So the timing of it was perfect

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.040
 'cause again, I was like sort of finished a bunch of things

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.000
 and was like with an eye towards performing live again

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 and A, plats is in my live setup.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.440
 So that's opening up, it is a synth source,

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.560
 but also I was like, I always want more gabber kicks.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.280
 I always want to make more gabber kicks.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.320
 That plus grit plus filter of crows

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.200
 was like two weekends in a row,

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.600
 just all I did over and over again

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.800
 was just make gabber kicks over and over again.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.240
 It was going from several hundred thousand gabber kicks

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.360
 to two million gabber kicks.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.880
 It was, yeah.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.640
 - I had a second runner up.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.480
 - Oh.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.240
 - I got to give the mod back Trinity some love.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.800
 It's probably my favorite drum module

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.640
 I've played with in quite a minute.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.560
 - Damn, it was wonderful how you were getting along with it.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.400
 - I'm liking it.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.680
 I'm liking it a lot, very versatile.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.440
 - The only major complaint I have with it so far is that

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.560
 you have three drums, but you're sharing the same knobs.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.400
 You know what I mean?

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.240
 - Right.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.920
 - I've already accidentally not clicked

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.400
 the correct drum sound and started messing with knobs

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.280
 and then messed up what I had going on on the kick

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.440
 while trying to fine tune the snare.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.400
 Yeah.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.800
 I don't see how they could easily get around it,

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.160
 'cause it's a lot of stuff crammed into a decently small-sized

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.760
 module, you know, like to have each drum,

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.080
 its own knobs, it would be a huge module.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.960
 So, I understand why they didn't go that route,

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.160
 but it does make it a bit tricky.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.800
 But sound wise, yeah, I'm loving it so far.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.320
 So yeah, shout out in second place for Trinity.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.600
 - Mine's a two-parter.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.440
 I actually had four things to start with,

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.800
 'cause I got some sound sources I really like.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.120
 But there's a non-modular modular and I got,

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.980
 I went big and got the most expensive

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.520
 piece of music equipment I've ever got

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:36.240
 and got the Oberheim OB6 desktop, which is a beast.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.120
 - Dude, it's like, when I sat down to use it,

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.080
 I was like, "Oh, this is what an extremely good

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.120
 quality synthesizer sounds like."

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.980
 And it's just like designed well and it gave me like,

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.240
 I was looking at Evolvers 'cause it like got me back.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.400
 I'm like, "I've been ignoring like Dave Smith

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.480
 and sequential stuff."

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.240
 'Cause it's like the way the filter works

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.840
 with the envelopes and the way the oscillators sound,

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.600
 it's like the perfect compliment to the virus tie.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.480
 And you can like turn the rez up all the way on the filter

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.240
 and it will never break up at all.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.840
 It's just like golden filter and like,

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.160
 seething the mode or like modulating the mode

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.720
 of the filter and being able to sweep through that.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.800
 It's like, it's one of those things where,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.760
 oh, be patching it and I would be fucking yelling.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.840
 Like I'm just like screaming in the house like,

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.340
 holy shit.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:28.120
 So that was like well worth it.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:28.960
 - Yeah.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.800
 I'm jealous.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.880
 - Oh dude, it's like, if you like,

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.760
 I convinced Luke to go get one surprise,

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.720
 but it's like one of those things,

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.520
 if you like synthesizers and you sit down

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.560
 and you don't like it, well, if you sit down

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.000
 and don't like you don't like synthesizers probably.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.880
 Like it's just kind of undeniably good.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.440
 It's very classic and you can make like John Carpenter

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.160
 fucking sounds all day kind of or like,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.040
 what to me in my ears close enough

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.440
 like a profit five, but they killed it too.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.920
 And like it's just perfectly nice to use.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.880
 It didn't like getting ripped off on the first one,

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.600
 which was on Amazon and it turned out

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.960
 and I didn't even realize this.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.800
 Luke was the one who was like,

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.920
 oh shit, here's one for like 1900.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.120
 I'm like, that's like 600 bucks off.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.720
 Ooh, it's on prime.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.040
 Like I'm gonna buy this and it was like super late at night.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.720
 I realized the next morning,

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.840
 the sellers from the Ukraine and I was like,

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.400
 hmm, not like sketched by that, but I'm like,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.040
 okay, they've got some sales.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.640
 And then I got really worried like a couple hours after

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.400
 when they shut their entire store down

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.120
 and all the products were gone.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:29.960
 Okay.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.800
 And I was like, ooh.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.720
 So it was a scam.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.400
 It was absolutely a scam.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.960
 I was trying to contact the person

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.840
 and they were like trolling me basically.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.720
 And then I was like, ooh fuck.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.760
 And then the next day I saw like six other feedbacks,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.320
 everybody got scammed.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.080
 And I think I was the end of the scam

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.280
 'cause I was like the last high dollar thing.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.920
 And they were like, ooh, gonna shut it down now.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.440
 - How the hell is shit like that get on the Amazon?

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.640
 - The nice thing is like good thing to know.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.440
 If you do that for anything under 2,500 bucks Amazon,

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.280
 we'll cover you.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.280
 Within a week I pretty much had my money back

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.560
 but you've got to wait to like prove like,

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.680
 oh they could still ship it.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.120
 And I'm like, dude, they're like,

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.960
 they shut their store down.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.520
 Like they're gone.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.040
 So that worked out and I ended up like

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.480
 a couple days through that I was like,

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.400
 oh, sweet water.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.680
 Like I'm gonna make my rep happy

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.840
 'cause I just like paid full price.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.200
 And got on and I was like, okay, that was 1000% worth it.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.880
 It was expensive but holy shit.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.800
 Like that's a life.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.640
 - What was it?

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.160
 - It was like 2,500 bucks.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.400
 - Yeah.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.640
 And I got it on sale for a little bit than after tax.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.200
 It's like kind of the same.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.400
 So I sold my sound devices, mixed pre-six.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.240
 I sold my ADAD expander to Luke.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.280
 I sold a couple modules like my squid samples gone now too.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.400
 And those pretty much got close enough

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.960
 to covering it within 500 bucks.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.960
 - Nice.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.920
 - So I do kind of miss those,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.880
 even though the squid like to touch on it quickly,

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.120
 it's like, I don't do much with sampling anymore.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.800
 And I've realized that's kind of gone for me.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.880
 I'll use the Octatrack or like even the ER 301,

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.480
 I might sell that 'cause I just like,

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.240
 I have another project I might use it for,

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.480
 which is a separate thing.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.760
 But I do, I will miss the sound devices mixed pre,

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.440
 even though I don't do field recordings.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.200
 It's like so good to like do Instagram videos

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.160
 that sound perfect.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.760
 And it was just nice, but I didn't need that thing.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.760
 I don't need to use six track recording remotely.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.360
 I would probably just get that Zoom H6

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.800
 if I wanted something else again.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.280
 It's more than good enough.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.400
 - That reminds me not to deviate,

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.400
 but like the seasonal affective disorder

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.880
 has been like rocking my ass the last few weeks.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.000
 And I was trying to think of like how to break out of that.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.040
 And one way I used to do that was like road trips,

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:41.880
 you know what I mean?

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.160
 But like I'm trying not to spend money

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.040
 or anything too much right now.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.040
 And I was trying to think of like what would be a good,

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.240
 you know, what would inspire a nice road trip

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.520
 and not cost a lot of money.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.720
 And then I was like, oh yeah,

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.920
 I haven't done field recording in a hot minute.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.760
 I was like gonna ask you guys

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.200
 if the weather is permitting anytime in the next few weeks,

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.560
 should anyone want to go to like a couple spots

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.600
 and do some like field recordings?

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.040
 - Is there any chance that I was gonna say no to that?

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.800
 You're like, of course.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.720
 - Yeah, cool.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.720
 Yeah, I'd be very much into it.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.760
 - Yeah, I'm 100% into that.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.240
 That sounds awesome.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.560
 - I would, the album that I'm working on,

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.240
 there's been multiple times where I'm like,

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.800
 "Hmm, I really like some like field recorded ambience

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.800
 in the background here."

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.640
 And I was like, "I don't have any fresh recordings

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.040
 and I want to dig through my old shit.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.360
 Like I want to do something fresh."

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.760
 And I was like, "Yeah, should probably get my ass

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.720
 to a couple of abandoned places soon

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.360
 or a couple of factories and start recording some sounds."

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.560
 - Awesome idea.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.400
 - Yeah.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.240
 - Yeah.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.080
 - That was the end.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.200
 I'll even mention that's enough of a review,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.240
 but the modular one was Deckard's voice,

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.400
 which I still haven't given a proper review of yet,

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.760
 but it's like similar level of like,

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.600
 "Ooh, this is what it's like when somebody designs something

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.800
 really fucking well."

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.640
 And it's just like--

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.560
 - You're hitting some high-end stuff.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.160
 - Yeah, both of those were really worth it.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.000
 - Yeah.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.120
 - Both pricey.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.920
 - No, very little actually.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.720
 Yeah, even though the Obi-6 is good at mono stuff,

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.160
 it's like surprisingly good at just like non.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.080
 First I was like, "This is gonna be great for chords."

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.960
 And then I realized like, "God damn, it's a bass monster."

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.800
 - Really?

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.920
 - Absolutely, destructive bass.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.320
 Not just more like John Carpenter analog,

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.680
 like that really just fucking deep analog bass sound.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.680
 It like owns that sound.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.600
 - Nice.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.120
 So it does sound like you're gonna have some things

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.240
 to talk about in the future.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.200
 - Both of those I need to put a little more time in.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.840
 And all I've been doing for the past couple of weeks

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.200
 is five times I'll just sit down and play the over hunt.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.880
 It's one of those where I can very kind of rare for me

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.080
 to be able to just sit down and like just enjoy playing

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.280
 a synth by itself.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.840
 And it's one of those.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.840
 You can just kind of get lost patching it for a minute.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.680
 - Nice.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.520
 - That's awesome.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.640
 - Yeah, both of those rule.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.280
 I couldn't recommend either of those more.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.280
 I know they're pricey, but those are two things where it's

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.520
 like, okay, it works for a ton.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.440
 - It's the dollar on it.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.280
 - Yeah.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.760
 Like that in a virus and an analog rhythm,

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.400
 see, I could work forever with those three

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.960
 and not give a fuck really.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.040
 - I've been going like the total opposite route.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.560
 I've been trying to like use filters as oscillators.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.800
 I'm tuning my feet back and see it as a sound sort of.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.680
 - Trying to like keep it super simple

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.960
 and like just very essential for sound sources right now.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:24.120
 But I do miss playing with like, you know,

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.200
 like you talking about that, the end of the virus

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.040
 and stuff like that.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.600
 I was like, man, I do miss playing on my virus.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.440
 - You know, it's great.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.840
 - I mean, just get lost in that world for a bit.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.280
 - That live set rejuvenated that for me pretty well.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.280
 No, I'm like very into the virus again.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.960
 - Yeah, that and the OB6 combo in each other perfectly

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.600
 in a mix, it can kind of freak me out how good

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.840
 they sound together.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.680
 - Well, speaking of filters,

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.640
 one of the categories was best filter.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:54.640
 - Yeah, I wrote down for that same one or effect.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.080
 - Okay.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:56.920
 - Didn't have to limit it to the filter,

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.160
 but like processor.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.600
 - It's on three plats again, is it?

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.440
 - No.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.280
 - All right.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.880
 - I'm sorry. - I already know

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.720
 what mine's picked.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.560
 - We do.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.960
 - So I'll start, 'cause I don't actually know

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.480
 anyone knows what mine's gonna be.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.040
 For me, 2022, filter of crows.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.840
 - Yeah, okay.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.280
 - So I got it and I think I was pretty positive

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.320
 in my initial review of this year.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.840
 - You almost convinced me to get one.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.680
 - Oh, really?

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.520
 - But I haven't pulled the trigger yet.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.520
 - We were all close.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.800
 - It can do everything.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.320
 It can be a nice, simple basic filter.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.800
 It can be just used as a preamp,

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.320
 just the crow part of it.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.320
 - Mm.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.800
 - The mixture of modes is fantastic.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.360
 Turning off the resident's stability

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.040
 is a completely separate noise source now.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.720
 Like it just does absolutely bonk her stuff

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.360
 and all in the cutoff and residents being CVable,

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.240
 just sequencing the chaos of that.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.080
 It's just like the separate other bonus device you get.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.640
 So yeah, I got a grit a couple months ago

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.520
 after we talked about it and I love it,

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.600
 but A, that's from 2021 and B,

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.640
 I love it, but filter of crows.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.560
 Like if I, you know, gun to my head,

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.840
 I probably would pick filter of crows.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.960
 I'm gonna keep them both, I'm gonna do great.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.720
 - Our guidelines are loose as usual.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.560
 - Yeah.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.520
 - We don't have to be made in 2022,

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.800
 just something that you got to discovered in 2020.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.360
 - I mean, my runner up would be grit.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.440
 But again, if I could only pick one,

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.640
 yeah, filter of crows, they absolutely fucking nailed it.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.160
 - Did you mention who that's by?

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.640
 - Oh, I did not mention who that's by.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.280
 It's by Pittsburgh modular.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.960
 - You know. - You can see this.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.680
 So yeah, that's my one and two

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.840
 for best filter of the year.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.280
 - Mm-hmm, correct.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.960
 - Take a guess what my first is.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.800
 - Grit.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.880
 - I'm thinking it's grit.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.880
 You're correct.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.720
 - Right.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.920
 - Oh, so that's why you were very keen on making sure

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.680
 that we established the rules that it didn't have to be

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.920
 in 2021, 'cause you were about to violate it within minutes.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.040
 - Grit has been a fucking game changer for me.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.800
 - Yeah, it's like the filter that I've always wanted

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.280
 to exist in your Iraq.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.200
 And things have come close, like stacking plague bearers

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.600
 and things like that.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.320
 Grit just fucking nails the type of saturation

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.480
 that I like to get out of my filters.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.200
 I love the sound of the resonance.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.760
 I love the limiter on the input that I can slam or ease back.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.800
 The only thing that it lacks that I wish it had

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.960
 was band pass mode.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.880
 - Oh, yeah. - But I'll survive.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.960
 But yeah, I love Grit.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.960
 I'm considering getting a second one.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.000
 It's amazing.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 And I hope that British noise electronics doesn't go under.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.880
 - Like we talked about last time,

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.240
 yeah, their website is still down.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.460
 Still no news about the future of the company.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.200
 Haven't seen any restocks.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.760
 - They've trickled some out,

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.240
 'cause you can get more at where we got it from now.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.440
 - They have like eight again.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.480
 - Yeah, that's, I did notice there was a couple up for sale.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.400
 That's the only module I've seen up for sale.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.560
 Everything else seems to be sold out everywhere.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.720
 And the bright scowging is fucking insane on reverb.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.440
 - It's unreal.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.960
 - But that's my first pick.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:18.960
 Second pick, Chase Bliss Generation Loss Mark II Petal.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.280
 - Loving it.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.920
 I absolutely loving it.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.920
 - I think a few people have either purchased that petal

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.520
 or want to because of your review.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.360
 - I'm glad.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.440
 I think it deserves the attention, you know?

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.600
 Like I really enjoyed the last iteration of it.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.960
 And this one I feel like they really knocked out of the park.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.880
 I've seen recently some people complaining about latency on it.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.720
 They just released two updates.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.440
 One is a firmware update that can help reduce that latency.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.560
 They said, if you feel like it's an issue,

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.880
 it does slightly alter the sound of it.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.280
 It gives it more of a flange effect on tight settings

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.160
 as opposed to like a corsy effect.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.480
 Me personally, I like the course sound.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.320
 - Sure, yeah.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.880
 - So I haven't updated.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.760
 And then I also released a hardware update

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.880
 that requires some soldering.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.720
 - Really?

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.560
 - Which, yeah.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.320
 And they offer it free and they said like,

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.160
 if you want to send them the petal,

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.400
 they'll do it for you type of thing

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.880
 'cause they don't want people breaking their petals.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.640
 But it's supposed to help with the base response

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.640
 come through at like no high pass whatsoever.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:31.120
 By default, there's a bit of a high pass that goes on with it.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.200
 Me personally, I don't mind it.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.480
 Like I don't expect everything to go through gracefully

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.960
 when I send sound into that petal.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:40.800
 You know what I mean?

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.720
 Especially base.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.960
 In fact, I kind of like the fact

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.520
 that it'll thin things out at times.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.680
 I don't need a high base response with it.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.760
 So I'm probably not gonna bother with the update.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.640
 But yeah, loving it still.

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.200
 I think they smashed it.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.840
 I'm curious to see what else they developed

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.400
 that will be in stereo and have CV capability

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.560
 like this one does.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:06.960
 - Well, big shock, my number one pick for the year.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.400
 British Noise Electronics Grid.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.240
 - Hell yeah.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.240
 - Thank you very much again for looking at me

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.680
 and being like, you should get that filter

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.680
 because I did.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.600
 And yeah, it's one of the best filters ever,

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.600
 incredibly unique sound, lots of stuff that,

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.600
 like you said, have been kind of wanting out of a filter

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.840
 but kind of struggling together,

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.920
 having to do a lot of work arounds and sounds.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.920
 It's the shit.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.400
 Build quality is excellent.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.760
 I've been loving it for a variety of things.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.840
 It just sounds good.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.280
 - Sounds, yeah, it sounds good.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:41.280
 And it sounds like it's just not holding back.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.120
 - Yeah.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.960
 - You know what I mean?

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.120
 Like some filters, you can just tell,

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.520
 they're pushing your audio in a very specific way.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.840
 This is just kind of like,

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.440
 it's like a tiny sandbox of potential, you know what I mean?

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.640
 Like if you want clean and squelchy, you can do that.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.720
 If you want it fucking shredded and like, you know,

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.360
 saturated and the resonance just breaking apart,

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.400
 you know, at the seams, yeah, you can do that too.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.520
 It's like, I like that.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.920
 I've noticed even like the CV ranges on the inputs

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.440
 are like massive.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.960
 Like they go beyond normal range.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:12.800
 - Yeah.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.320
 - It's like kind of cool.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.280
 - I like that.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.800
 - My second pick kind of runner up would be

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.000
 the surge variable bandwidth filter,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.200
 which is a weird one.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.040
 You can't even get a DIY version of it.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.520
 Most of my random source surge stuff I've built.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.840
 It doesn't even have resonance.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.320
 It just has, you know, that variable bandwidth control,

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.600
 which gets to be very resonant like sounds.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.480
 It kind of like squeezes the sound

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.040
 in this really interesting way.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.760
 I didn't even really know about that filter topology.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.680
 I saw that originally.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.560
 I was like, no resonance.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.080
 I don't give a shit because it's a filter

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.040
 and I want resonance.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.720
 Well, I was at the No Way Back party in May

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.040
 and seeing outer space play live, my friend John

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.600
 and his friend.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.800
 And the last track was just making these sounds

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.000
 that were like almost these like phaser sounds.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.600
 And it was like, it was blowing my mind at the time.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.760
 And I even talked to John a little after the set.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.840
 I'm like, what was that last track?

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.840
 He was like, oh, this is just like,

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.160
 we're processing a bunch of the shit

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.320
 with like the banana version of like a surge variable band

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.160
 with the filter.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.320
 He's like, that's the coolest fucking filter in the world.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.640
 And I was like, whoa, okay.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.240
 Like that's your opinion carries a little weight.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.920
 Like I'm going to check that.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.720
 I think I ordered it like the next day or something.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.320
 I was like, oh, I want to fucking try this.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.680
 And it made me realize I think, you know,

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.680
 emu samplers and like drum and bass

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.880
 and how they were used for that.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.320
 Like one of the things that they had

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.680
 was like the variable band with EQ.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.080
 And I think a lot of those similar

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.760
 because I noticed myself getting sounds like,

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.000
 oh, that sounds like the tech step sound

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.200
 I could never quite like make as easily as I could

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.720
 or I had to use like multiple filters

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.760
 to write a variable band with filter basically.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.880
 And that was another eye opener.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.680
 It's not something I use all the time,

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.000
 but there's a really cool thing it can do.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.720
 And I like kind of exploring that flavor.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.800
 Very unique, not many things can do it.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.200
 That satanics macro pod can do it too.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.360
 And it has resonance, but I find the surge

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.880
 to be a little cleaner, a little more surgical.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.400
 And for that, I kind of like that effect.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.720
 Yeah, a good solid runner up to the grit,

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.560
 but the grit definitely favorite one from the year.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.400
 Nice.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.240
 Very nice.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:26.400
 All right, well, one of the other ones was firmware update

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.240
 of the year.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.800
 Mine's Plats.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.920
 Yeah, I was gonna say it's easy.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.200
 Yeah, I mean, we've talked, we've already talked about it.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.320
 I didn't know if anyone had orange mode all day.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.400
 All fucking day.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.800
 I guess this is an opportunity for anyone to see

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.880
 a second place if they had one.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:45.400
 I love to, I will say about the Plats orange mode.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.440
 You can't update their engine brains with the new firmware.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.240
 There's a hardware difference that prevents that

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.480
 from happening and I just fucking love them.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.600
 Because if you bought that module,

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.640
 you're kind of a fucking moron, I'm sorry.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.680
 Especially when you can get a clone of the actual plats.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.840
 Too many better options on to your clones.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.720
 For a little display, you don't need it all.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.640
 So, disappointments.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.280
 Disappointments of flaps.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.080
 Disappointments slash flop.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:14.920
 I'll start again.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.360
 So I have something for this category,

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.200
 but I feel like disappointment isn't actually

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.480
 the right word for me.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.520
 Because I went in--

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.280
 Under disgust.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.720
 No, no, that's a separate category altogether.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.200
 And that I reserved for myself.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.000
 This was like, I'm interested in this

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.280
 and I hope it's better than I think it's gonna be.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.280
 And it turned out to basically be as bland

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.120
 as I thought it was gonna be.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.160
 So it's disappointment in the sense that I got rid of it.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.200
 I didn't like it.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:47.000
 And it was a very hyped piece of kit.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.480
 For me, nautilus.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.960
 I don't get it.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.800
 I think it's a flop.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.600
 I think it's boring.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.600
 I covered it in detail and I even kept it for a little bit

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.280
 while after that was like, you know,

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.600
 let me just double type before I get rid of this.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.080
 Honestly, it's kind of just over a price garbage.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.000
 I don't like it.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.160
 If this is your bag, if this is what you're into,

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.840
 I hope you're not offended.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.080
 But it is like not even remotely for me.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.960
 So that nautilus is the not quite disappointment

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.680
 'cause I didn't have high hopes.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:26.360
 But even the modicum of hope I had was dashed.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.320
 Yeah.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.840
 I may not be 100% on board with where Cuba's at.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.600
 I kind of lean.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.640
 Lean that way too.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.680
 I like the Aurora.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.880
 I have the Accord V2.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.560
 The Accord V2 I could probably do without.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.720
 The Aurora is still cool.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.720
 I'm still like that.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:43.400
 - So, Greg, what is your disappointment slash flop?

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.840
 - Paulian play.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.680
 - Oh, good one.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.520
 - Yeah.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.040
 - I bought into the marketing hype.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.480
 And I shouldn't have.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.680
 I knew better.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.520
 I should have trusted my gut.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.840
 And you gave it a decent amount of time.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.680
 - I did.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.880
 I gave it a fair shake.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.480
 'Cause I mean, there's potential there.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.120
 You know, I don't want to call it a complete flop.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:11.120
 But yeah, it did not do what I wanted a machine to do really.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.240
 It's too dumb down, too restrictive.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.840
 You know, the whole like being limited to 16 steps

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.440
 and the whole, I mean, the whole thing

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.040
 that they're really pushing for it,

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.240
 at least all the influencers and such

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.720
 proportion about it was like it's generative functions.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.360
 But like really, you're just juggling presets.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.280
 Like it's not really doing much

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.800
 that I would call generative.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.000
 You know, and you're working within the confines

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.160
 of what they deem to be a kick or a snare

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.200
 or a hat pattern.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.080
 And you know, I don't know, I just found it

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:53.080
 kind of more limiting and restrictive than liberating.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.880
 You know, I found the Paulian tracker

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:01.880
 to be more inviting for generative stuff personally.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.080
 I could see that.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.080
 And it feels like they, it's almost like they neutered it

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.720
 intentionally so that there wasn't much spillover

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.840
 between like the play and the tracker.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:13.680
 Yeah.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.440
 Which is unfortunate because this thing had the potential

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.240
 to be like tracker 2.0.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.080
 Right.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.640
 And just have like a nicer, you know,

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.000
 interface to the tracker and new features and things.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.560
 But no, they, they want a different route.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:31.360
 They kept a two separate project or two separate products,

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.480
 you know, and neither are really cheap at this point.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.200
 The price of the tracker has gone up over the last couple

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.040
 of years.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.640
 The play retails for like 900 if I recall.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.280
 Oh wow.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.400
 So yeah, 900 bucks for a 16 step preset machine

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.080
 was just not what I was looking for.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.680
 And I still have my tracker.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.680
 I still use it.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.600
 I wouldn't say it's my go to.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.080
 I still use Deluge and Alex are way more than that.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.160
 But for when I go and need that,

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.200
 I need to track or nailed it.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:04.440
 So I think, I think they know how to make a good product.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:04.960
 Yeah.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.880
 I think they're like electron where they it's like,

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.520
 you guys need to get out of your own fucking way

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.200
 and stop trying to worry about like having these products

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.160
 that are discreet and don't overlap with each other

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.560
 and just make the best thing you fucking can.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.280
 Yeah.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.080
 That and no stereo sampling, you know.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:20.440
 Yeah.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.520
 It's so weird.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.520
 Well, I mean, there's no sampling on it at all.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.240
 It's you can't sample into it or record.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.680
 But like the samples that you do load into it,

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.840
 same as the tracker, it has to be mono.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.840
 It's restricted with the size and the track length and all that.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.680
 And it's like, yeah, I don't know.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.200
 And someone with a tracker, if they made the play

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.920
 what you describe, this tracker 2.0 and all these people,

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.080
 I wouldn't be mad.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.840
 I wouldn't be like, oh fuck, fuck this tracker.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.840
 You know, like it still is the, you know, it's--

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.400
 The tracker is a modern classic.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:50.600
 Yeah.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:55.880
 I think there will ever be a following around that product.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.200
 And if they come up with a new version,

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.120
 there's still going to be people that are probably

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.640
 very religious about 1.0.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:01.960
 Right.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.200
 I would not have been mad if there was a 2.0, a new version,

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.000
 and it had all this other stuff.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.200
 I'd be like, I still like, I'm still

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.080
 getting a ton of shit out of the tracker.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.400
 There's just now two options.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.800
 Yeah.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.120
 So I don't think-- I think the idea

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.120
 that people are going to get mad,

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.600
 because there have been an update,

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.240
 and it had too much overlap.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.680
 I think that's a faulty premise.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.040
 So much wasted potential.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:23.560
 Yeah.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:23.840
 Great.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.080
 If they would have just done a few slight changes,

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.640
 I would still have a place sitting on my desk for sure.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.160
 Right.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.200
 But, you know, who knows?

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.160
 Maybe someday with tracker 2.0,

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.560
 we'll get what I want out of price.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.080
 Right.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.520
 Like that.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:40.680
 And for me, it would be the Oxyone sequencer, actually.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.640
 I thought about this for a while.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.920
 The Erica Black sequencer was another fail for me,

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.000
 but that was one I kind of like--

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:48.840
 It's an older one.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.920
 The Oxyone was one that I had a lot of hope for.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.600
 And I know that there are people that love it.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.000
 It's not like it's some fundamentally flawed thing,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.480
 but I think the way that it doesn't really have screens.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.480
 And, you know, getting the Hapax--

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.720
 like, I'm a squar bitch for the most part.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:08.600
 I think the way that they have their stuff simple,

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.560
 and the way that they manage screens,

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.240
 and everything like the Hapax is just--

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.840
 I can't imagine using another sequencer

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.440
 for the type of melodic stuff that it does.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.000
 It's just such a joy to use live.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:22.520
 And so easy.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:26.200
 And I thought with the Oxyone, it was always just kind of a--

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.960
 not a great user interface.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:31.840
 It's hard for me to navigate, hard to know what I needed to do,

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.960
 way too many hot keys to save and shit like that.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.720
 And it's like, oh, you could have just made

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:42.160
 a bigger device kind of, and had more options in my mind.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.240
 But I think it's great that they did it,

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.440
 and they keep updating it.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.480
 They've made all these updates.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.960
 But I don't miss that.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.440
 Any capacity, I think the squar up

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.800
 is far superior for my needs.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.800
 Nice.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.880
 We were too harsh.

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.440
 I mean, as far as the category about disappointments,

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.960
 I feel-- I mean, I guess I did call something garbage.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.200
 But outside of that, I think that wasn't too harsh.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:03.960
 Yeah.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.200
 I'm more or less disappointed in myself, too,

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.600
 when it comes to the play for falling into that marketing

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.640
 hype, you know?

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:16.240
 Like, dude, influencers are pushing that so fucking hard.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.440
 So wait, before we get into this,

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.080
 isn't there a category related to this?

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:19.680
 There is.

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.440
 I guess we want to segue.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:20.880
 Do we want to segue?

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.880
 Yeah, we want to segue.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:22.440
 Yeah, let's do it.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.240
 The category-- well, as suggested by some of our patrons,

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:30.680
 they wanted to hear what we considered the hackiest hack

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:34.840
 of the year when it comes to influencers and reviewers

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.200
 and also worst influencer trend of 2022.

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.640
 So we could probably tie those together.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.200
 But yeah, I don't want to name, drop anyone

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.680
 that I consider to be the hackiest hack.

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.080
 But describe them to the point where it can only be one person

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.240
 and we know what you're talking about.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:50.800
 That's the thing.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.720
 I don't have one name in mind.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.640
 Like, we were talking about this just the other day,

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.400
 the three of us, offline or whatever.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.560
 And it seemed like 2022, especially over the last few months,

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.760
 has been a horrible fucking year for people

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:11.200
 shilling for products and companies.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.920
 And I can't even really blame them.

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.880
 Obviously, the market's crazy right now.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.840
 Things are hard to get.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.800
 Things are expensive.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.120
 People aren't spending as much.

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:24.800
 So companies are throwing products at reviewers

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.640
 and influencers with obvious some pretty high stipulations

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.000
 that they need to get the fucking hype train rolling.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.560
 But with buyers having fewer choices

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.480
 and basically only getting a couple of things,

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.960
 they're trying to make sure that their product is the one

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.120
 that they're buying.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.920
 Which is not that different than any other year

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.480
 in the history of capitalism, but it does seem like it's

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.240
 a little bit more pointed now.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.680
 It seemed very excessive there.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.760
 Especially when you're subscribed to multiple people on YouTube

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.040
 and you realize they all released a video on the same product

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.480
 at the same minute and they're all saying the same fucking shit

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.920
 like it's a script.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.680
 It's like, OK.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.240
 And yeah, the Paul Ian play was a big one for that.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.320
 I can't even recall a product that I've seen get pushed

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:15.120
 so hard by so many different influencers and reviewers

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.160
 at the same time.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.440
 Very coordinated effort.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.640
 Now, I'll give some props to Red Means recording Jeremy Blake

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.560
 for kind of like, I think, finally piercing through the veil

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.720
 of some of that nonsense because he said the same thing.

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.920
 He's like, oh, someone's going to send me a half-baked product

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.640
 that doesn't do half of the things it said

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.200
 so we can all release this video at the same time.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.200
 But we can't really be critical of it

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.680
 because we're worried about not getting future support from them.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.760
 And I'm like, damn, that's not a great system

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.120
 that's going on right now.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:42.800
 That's the thing too.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.840
 Yeah, because things are hard to get inexpensive,

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.720
 like, clearly, these people don't want to lose their hookup

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:50.320
 from getting free or discounted gear.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.400
 So they're just going to say good stuff, you know?

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:58.040
 Or at the very least, underplay the faults

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.760
 that they uncover with this stuff.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.400
 And there are people that are just getting into all of this

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.720
 that don't necessarily know that's a system that

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.840
 is driving some of these videos that they're seeing.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.280
 Some 15-year-old who's getting into this and being like,

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.080
 I'm really excited because that guy that I liked

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:12.920
 is really excited about it.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.200
 I was like, oh, well, there's excitement.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.000
 It's not genuine.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.840
 That's the thing.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.080
 I fell for that this year.

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.000
 Like, when I said 15-year-old, I mean, we don't like hype.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.040
 Like, usually I have a pretty good eye

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.760
 to see through the bullshit, you know what I mean?

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.160
 Like, we've been in this for a while, you know?

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:34.240
 But I was able to ignore most of the hype

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.240
 with the polyanplay.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:40.240
 However, Ben Jordan putting out two massive videos,

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.080
 super polished, you know what I mean?

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.240
 Like all that, like all focused on the play.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.360
 And like him, the way he sold it, I believed him.

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.200
 You know what I mean?

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.680
 For a while, like he was hyping it up as, you know,

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.240
 IDM in a box and all this shit.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.680
 And I'm like, okay, that sounds cool, you know?

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.360
 But yeah, it's not.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.360
 - And especially coming from him, I mean,

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.320
 he was a successful talented IDM artist.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.680
 - Sure, I respect Ben's opinion.

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.520
 - Sure, yeah.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.920
 - And so I was kind of like a little sad that like,

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.120
 you know, I bought into what he was saying

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:22.680
 because I respect him and I like him as, you know,

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.240
 a person and an artist.

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:28.440
 But yeah, clearly, you know,

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.520
 he's always kind of chilled for polyan stuff.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.920
 This wasn't gonna be any different.

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.520
 You know, I mean, like this was a carefully marketed,

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.680
 you know, production that he did

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.760
 across the span of two videos, you know?

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.640
 I kind of bought into it, but, you know,

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.240
 and maybe for some people it is IDM in a box, I guess.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.080
 Maybe his words, you know, aren't,

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.960
 I'm not saying he lied, I'm just saying like,

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.720
 I heard what I wanted to hear, you know,

00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.760
 out of what he was saying.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.600
 And I didn't give it enough judgment

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.720
 before dropping $900 on a machine that was kind of,

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.640
 you know, a flop for me.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.520
 - Yeah, I think you said it well.

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.240
 And somebody else mentioned it in the same term

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.960
 as it's kind of like a paint by numbers box, you know,

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.360
 for this perspective.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.600
 And it's like, once I heard that,

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.640
 I was like, oh, that really kind of hit.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.440
 I'm like, I see what they did there.

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.880
 I don't know if it's what I would ever want,

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.360
 but they got close, but not quite.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.880
 - Yeah, overall, it's just like the,

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.760
 the shilling right now is kind of insane.

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.760
 We can't even pinpoint one person.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.200
 I don't think I would anyways, you know what I mean?

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.440
 I don't want to call people out.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.240
 Like, I think people, most people,

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.000
 especially our listeners are smart enough to see

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.800
 who's shilling, who's being a hackiest hack, you know what I mean?

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.120
 - They don't need us the name drop,

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.760
 but it's just bad overall right now.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:52.800
 There's very few sources that I will bother to watch anymore

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.160
 'cause like this year has made me numb

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:59.280
 to the amount of shilling and half-assed reviews.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.880
 - I mean, I still put it out there, Ben Divkid.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.560
 I do take what they present with,

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.560
 it holds a lot more water 'cause I don't feel like

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.160
 I'm being sold or prodded.

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.200
 I feel like I'm just watching someone who's very enthusiastic

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.680
 and knows what they're doing,

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.480
 put something through its paces.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.360
 I don't know, I wouldn't say that's end of list,

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.920
 but the list isn't much longer than that.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.920
 - I was just gonna say the same.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:25.040
 Like I think I'll typically watch like Ben Jordan's stuff

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.240
 just to see what he's talking about.

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:31.400
 And I'll watch Divkid's technical overviews of things.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:36.840
 I don't really watch Divkid's videos to sell me on a product.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.200
 I'll usually watch videos with stuff that I'm already

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.760
 interested in that he's doing, I'm like cool,

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.880
 I'm gonna get a technical overview.

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.320
 He's gonna paint a wide brush showing

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.720
 many ways this product can be used.

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.160
 - It's putting into its paces and it is a little bit more

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.160
 like letting the device that he's reviewing do the talking.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.040
 - Yeah, so I guess it's more productive for us to say

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.560
 who we think is not the hackiest of all.

00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.680
 (laughing)

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.480
 - Another one I put out and this is a little bit weird

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.200
 because it's not directly synthesizer

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.200
 and it's Emily Harpist.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.200
 - Mm-hmm.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.680
 - They do a lot of pedal reviews.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.440
 And the reason I really was sort of glummed onto it,

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.520
 A, I just like the way harp sound

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.640
 and B, they're very like, they're a charming personality,

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:22.080
 but also they're not just playing smoke on the water

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.800
 through a guitar pedal and telling me how

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.280
 oaky the timber is.

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.120
 - Yeah.

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.760
 - Like finding anything for pedals that isn't just someone

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.800
 running a fancy guitar through it and playing the same

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.120
 three classic rock songs was very tedious

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.920
 and just someone doing something different,

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.600
 like running a harp through a pedal,

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.480
 it turns out is wildly more informative

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.200
 than hearing a guitar go through it.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.880
 - I always will go to, you know,

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.880
 loop ups and skip to the pros and cons

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.160
 and just see what feedback he has

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.800
 but other than that, I don't even have

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.880
 - He's specific attention to anybody.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.960
 - Even them, I feel like he's been going a little soft

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:02.960
 on certain things or he'll get stuff

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.320
 and just point out like, you know,

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:08.080
 this firmware might, is a beta firmware or whatever,

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.680
 so like these options might not be in there.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.640
 It's like, okay, but a lot of times it seems like

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.560
 those features never come anyway.

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.400
 - Right, right.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.240
 - You know what I mean?

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.120
 Like, I don't know, I like Lupop,

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:21.080
 but yeah, I don't know, I feel like he's kind of,

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.560
 at least these days this year,

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.200
 not so much reviewing stuff that he cares about,

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.480
 but just reviewing whatever the hell

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.880
 free shit's getting sent his way, you know what I mean?

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.560
 And so like, you gotta take that with a grain of salt.

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.040
 And I feel like that right there might answer

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.240
 the worst influence we're trying of 2022.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:40.920
 It seems like standards have fucking dropped this year.

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.600
 Pretty high, or pretty low, I should say.

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.320
 And people are just, you know,

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.240
 doing whatever to get free stuff.

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.600
 Or, yeah, or afraid to fuck up the flow of free stuff.

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.800
 Which is kind of, well then you offer

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.480
 like very little utility to scare you.

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.760
 - Scared to get fired by Electron or something.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.600
 - Yeah.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.440
 (laughing)

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.120
 - For instance, yeah.

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.200
 I mean, at that point, if everyone's just

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.960
 towing the company line, you just need one person to do it.

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.840
 They put out the video that everyone's going to make,

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.800
 and the script they're gonna read,

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:15.800
 we don't need five, 10, 15 influencers

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.960
 doing the exact same thing.

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.800
 - Right.

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.440
 - It's like why even bother watching different ones

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.360
 if they're all going to be doing the same thing,

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.520
 with the same gear, reading the same more or less script.

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.320
 You know, and not really putting things through its pace

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:32.520
 has just been like, you know, everything, all year.

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.520
 It was just like, oh wow, this is the greatest thing ever.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.160
 Like, 10 reasons why you need this in your setup.

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.680
 And like, you know what I mean, shit like that.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.360
 It's just like, everything that came out

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.640
 was like the next thing that you needed to get.

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.800
 And it's just like, really?

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:46.960
 I don't know about that.

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.760
 And with no more information than what's on the product page.

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:50.600
 - Right.

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.680
 - Which is, I think funny, 'cause it kind of results

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.480
 in some like a blowback towards us

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.960
 because I'll hear people be like, oh, you guys trash stuff.

00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:59.640
 I don't think so, you know?

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.480
 I think we are trying to be honest about the things

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.480
 that we come across.

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.560
 Like we-- - Like form opinions,

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.560
 and sometimes it's not the best opinion of how to say it.

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.440
 - Well, I mean, when you look at a landscape

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.920
 where everyone is just so saccharin and positive,

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:13.360
 and everything's the greatest thing ever,

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.000
 for somebody to even deviate from that,

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.840
 even a little by going, oh, it wasn't that great.

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.760
 It sounds like trashing.

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.600
 - Yeah.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.840
 - Yeah, the poly and play marketing barrage

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.920
 is what kind of brought that to my attention.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.720
 And then I kind of like didn't think too much of it

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:32.080
 until the Perkins started making its rounds.

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:32.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.000
 - And like, holy fuck, I think everyone who even like,

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.400
 can even be slightly qualified as an influencer

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.760
 did what they could to get a free fucking Perkins.

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.600
 (laughing)

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.680
 - Because so many videos like all at once

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.600
 after like radio silence for months,

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:50.160
 and all that spam, everyone had all these fucking Perkins

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.320
 videos and everyone's talking about how it's the best thing

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.720
 ever, and it's like, I'm interested in it.

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.000
 - I would like a Perkins, but it's a $2,000 fucking drum machine

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.400
 with only four voices, you know?

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.280
 So like, I wanna see people that are actually putting it

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.720
 through its paces and speaking about its weaknesses.

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:11.200
 And you know, I had to do a lot of research to pull up

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.960
 what I consider weaknesses to be,

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:16.120
 because no one else was talking about it.

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.720
 You know, and I'm like, I watched like every video.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:22.240
 And I'm like, that information just really wasn't

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.880
 brought to the surface or focused on much.

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.080
 You know, everyone just wants to focus on, you know,

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.080
 the bells and whistles.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.440
 - Right, right.

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:34.520
 - And tell you why you need to spend $2,000 on a drum machine.

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.480
 - Yeah. - It's like, mm.

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.360
 - So yeah, I think that's the worst trend of 2022.

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.200
 - No, I agree. - I agree.

00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.200
 - We've seen a lowering of standards is what I would say.

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.680
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:47.720
 - We need real journalists like us out there in the streets.

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.920
 - So like, - For you the real news.

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.120
 - If everybody kind of like stepped up their level

00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.800
 of just like fair criticism, what are they gonna,

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:57.120
 or people gonna stop giving free gear out to everybody?

00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.640
 - If the one person who doesn't do that though,

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.760
 is gonna be that one influencer, then doesn't start getting it.

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.280
 No one wants to be the person left out.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.760
 - Yeah. - It just takes,

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.200
 basically if everyone agreed on mass,

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.680
 we're gonna be more critical and everyone moved up.

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.840
 Nothing changes, but if that one person doesn't,

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:19.040
 and it's just gonna chill, it's almost like a union vote.

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:19.880
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.560
 - Yeah, like if we all vote union,

00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:22.760
 we're gonna be very more powerful,

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.200
 or collective bargaining is gonna increase.

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:28.320
 - But just a ball of modular shills.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.640
 (laughing)

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:34.240
 - All right, so I guess there's more categories.

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.120
 Oh, there was one I know that was best user interface,

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.320
 or best or worse interface.

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.600
 - Yeah, where's, I'll start.

00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:43.080
 Feel free, 'cause I've got a controversial hot take on this.

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.000
 - Oh. - Oh.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.400
 - I don't have an answer to this.

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.640
 This is another Patreon suggestion, I think.

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.720
 I was talking to my partner before this,

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.560
 I was like, oh fuck, I don't know the answer to this.

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.720
 And we started talking about just,

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.720
 not just synthesizer interfaces,

00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:00.680
 but minor interaction with technology interfaces in general.

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:04.320
 We came to the conclusion that I'm malleable,

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.480
 and kind of a pushover,

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.640
 and I will trudge through any shitty interface.

00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:12.960
 And so like, the reason I can't pick one is,

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.520
 'cause I'm like, well, that's probably not that good,

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.480
 but I figured out how to use it anyway,

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.680
 and I'm fine with it.

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.720
 So that was a long way for me to say,

00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.760
 I'm going to abstain from this one,

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.880
 because everything's fine.

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:27.720
 - That's fine.

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.560
 (laughing)

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:30.840
 I was actually going to say something similar,

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:34.520
 but I am far, far from someone that trudges

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.360
 through interfaces.

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.200
 - Same here.

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:41.200
 - Like, yeah, I don't like menu diving at all,

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.040
 you know what I mean?

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:46.120
 I suffer from option paralysis quite easily.

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.000
 Like, I like to keep things simple.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.440
 And I was going to say something along similar lines there,

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:54.400
 like where I don't have one to pick for that category.

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.880
 Like, for once, I think in the last decade,

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:03.000
 maybe more, I did a good job of not buying anything

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.200
 that I hated the interface with.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.440
 I kind of did a great job,

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.920
 and I'm going to pat myself on the back for like,

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:13.040
 you know, buying things that I could tell

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.800
 I would probably jive with interface-wise.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.640
 - It's a good idea.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.880
 - Yeah, like, you know, I didn't get anything

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.720
 complicated this year, like, sequencers or anything

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.280
 that had like a deep menu system.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.600
 Like, I just kind of knew I wasn't in that vibe,

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.200
 and I just kind of avoided it,

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.040
 and it's worked out good.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:31.880
 (laughing)

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.760
 Now, I realize you've pattered yourself on the back,

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.120
 and we were about to deviate and go straight to Nick,

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.000
 but I do want to stop and say,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.520
 was there anything that you were researching

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.080
 over the last year where you were like,

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.560
 oh shit, I want that,

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.320
 but you opted out of getting it,

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.520
 because you realized the interface

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.840
 was going to give you fits.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.600
 - That's a good question.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.640
 Off the top of my head.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.960
 - What do we want to go to Nick?

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.960
 What do you think about this?

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.800
 - Yeah, yeah, Nick, I'll think about that one for a second.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.160
 - It's funny, 'cause mine's similar to Greg,

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.920
 I'm like more like gonna reject things.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:03.000
 I'm looking at my sold items in reverb right now.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:03.840
 - I didn't realize that.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.280
 - I realized that most of them are like,

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.440
 I could go through like, I/O Labs Flux, great idea,

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.200
 absolute least favorite interface

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.720
 I think I've run into in a while.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.000
 Oxy One, similar, Roland MC707,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.200
 terrible interface for the most part.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.560
 It's a kind of a list of things

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.360
 that I'd got sick of putting up with.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.880
 TR09, terrible interface.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.320
 Yeah, very similar.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.880
 I don't have the ability to put up

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.680
 with a lot of stuff like that that I just don't like.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.560
 Scott's Kermit Mark III hated it.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.800
 It just way too many hidden things.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.840
 And the more I have in the past year

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.320
 made my modular simpler and gotten like,

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.800
 squid sample good interface,

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.760
 but another thing of like complexity

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.520
 and something I could get lost making a drum kit.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.440
 The more I like flatten things out,

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.400
 the much happier I am with my modular

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.320
 and getting like complex interfaces

01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.040
 that are hard to remember or things with like lots of modes.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.920
 Getting those out helps a lot.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.840
 I'm getting better with mutable stages now,

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.960
 but I don't use like,

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.080
 there's still a lot of modiness to it

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.880
 and like things it can do that for me is like,

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.880
 not what I want to do all the time.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.880
 Whereas I think mutable tides is like the opposite,

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.040
 very simple to know like where you're at,

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.760
 configure it and things like that.

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.880
 Bead's also a little more complicated and like kind of,

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.520
 you gotta remember some things

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.520
 that can be a little annoying.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.440
 But if I'm correct me if I'm wrong,

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.680
 but at the beginning of the episode,

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.480
 you said you got a second ornament in crime.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.440
 So how are you driving with that?

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.120
 'Cause that is multi-modal.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.280
 - Great question.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.360
 I think I still, I picked that up,

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.640
 still remembered how to use it,

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.360
 thought it was easy to navigate around,

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.560
 even remembered some of the hot keys to like save state

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.480
 or to get back to things.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.960
 So ornament and crime for the most part so far,

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.120
 pretty straightforward,

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120
 especially since I'm like,

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:53.240
 oh, I'm gonna leave this in quanamene pretty much 99%

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.040
 of the time, it's just a quantizer for me

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040
 that I didn't have.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.400
 - Gotcha.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.840
 So Greg, back to you.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.400
 You look at your chewing on this.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.640
 - I'm trying to think, I can't think of anything

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.360
 that like I really wanted but opted not to buy

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.200
 because of the interface.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.680
 I think I've gotten,

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.440
 I think it's just kind of like a reflex now.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.280
 - Right, right.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280
 - Where like if I look at something

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.320
 and I see a bunch of fucking menus and key,

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.600
 you know, menu diving and key combos

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.880
 and so I just automatically write it off as not for me.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.720
 - Yeah, right.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.360
 - Because yeah, it just,

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.600
 I just don't have that type of attention span right now.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.280
 Like especially when I'm like halfway through an album,

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.640
 like I am kind of like currently.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.480
 - Yeah.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.520
 - You know, trying to introduce something like that

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.560
 while you're in the middle is just so--

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.400
 - Oh yeah.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.560
 - You can just fuck up your flow.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.400
 - You can fuck up your head.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.200
 - You know these, it's just like, yeah, right now,

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.760
 I've just been doing a good job of avoiding

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.040
 things with shitty interfaces,

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.200
 just things that appeal to me with, you know,

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.560
 like knob per function.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.400
 - Right, right.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.600
 - Things like that, you know, no menu

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.720
 or very little menu diving involves

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.880
 like that has been my go to throughout the year

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.240
 and I think I'm gonna be sticking with it for now.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.400
 - Yeah. - No, it's awesome.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.960
 - Yeah.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.440
 - All right, so what other categories did,

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.480
 I've wrote my stuff on a piece of paper

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.080
 but I know that there was a far more technical presentation

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.480
 of this list.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.480
 - You're the 2022 major regret selling the most.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.520
 - Oh yeah, that was interesting.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.640
 - So you had nothing in that category.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.840
 I couldn't really think of anything

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.440
 that I regretted getting rid of.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.600
 - Nothing that you got back?

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.280
 - Oh yeah, I guess I did get like count the octatrack,

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.280
 I got that back ornament and crime.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.800
 - Yeah, I was gonna say Zadar for me.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.000
 Like at the start of 2022,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.040
 I kind of decided I wasn't into Zadar as much anymore

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.760
 and I kind of didn't like the interface and I sold it.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.840
 And then like as time progressed,

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.600
 I found myself missing it more and more

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.720
 and I got it back just a couple weeks ago

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.360
 and I'm like in love with it all over again.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.080
 I'm like, why did I ever sell this?

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.040
 I don't know what, like yeah,

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.240
 I'm really digging on it.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.520
 So yeah, I don't know if anything else

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.760
 would fall into that category.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.600
 I don't think so.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.040
 I think probably just Zadar.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:11.160
 - Yeah, I think- - I was gonna say

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.720
 I got another dark matter, Bastol,

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.280
 'cause it was a good sale on it too

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.240
 and I kind of missed it.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.040
 So that's another one that I got back

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.560
 and I only sold that like within the year.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.520
 - I didn't even know you sold it.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.360
 - Yeah, I was one of those ones where I'm like,

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.640
 I don't use this, I need room.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.480
 - Yeah.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.440
 - And I kind of get over my trying to fit everything in.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.920
 So I'll just swap stuff out now.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.920
 - Yeah, I do have more.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.440
 I'm gonna tell them my thing and I just bought back

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.480
 like multiple WMD stuff.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.320
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.840
 - That I did sell.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:37.680
 - I was saying.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.200
 - Well, I guess I sold most of that last year?

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.880
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:45.480
 And now mainly because of the sale.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:48.280
 Because I was missing some of this stuff over the year.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.960
 Just I guess two months ago or something like that,

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:55.160
 I got back two trash masters, two muscle compressors.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.680
 And I'm loving them to death

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.440
 and I don't know why the fuck I ever sold them.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.640
 - Right. - Yeah.

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.720
 Just the way 2022 has shaped up

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.080
 and made me realize that I missed those

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.080
 and it would probably be very hard to get in the future.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.840
 So I might as well get them back now.

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:12.680
 - She knew me. - Right, right.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.520
 - And hang on to them this time.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.800
 Those were at WMD Digital VCA.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.920
 I got the 4HP1 which they'd sold out at the store

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.080
 but then I found like a really cheap one on Reverb.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.240
 And that's like,

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.800
 I shouldn't have sold that in the first place.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.400
 It's so useful if you just don't want envelopes to click

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.320
 for something or if you want based to like not ever pop

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.760
 or click like that, it's worth it.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.360
 - Yeah.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.600
 It's funny because like there's multiple examples

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.880
 of both we've given that like Zadar and Dark Matter

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.960
 were like even when I wasn't using them,

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.800
 I was like, I mean, I could get rid of them

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.720
 but like I know I'm gonna want this back.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.800
 Like Dark Matter. - Yeah.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.160
 - Even if it's not in every batch.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.160
 But when I go and I reach for it,

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.440
 so fucking glad it's there.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.400
 - I just went through this phase like at the beginning

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.640
 of the year where like if there wasn't something

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.080
 that was getting a lot of use out of me,

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.680
 I would rather have had that funds

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.960
 and that space dedicated to something else

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.400
 or something new. - We were both in that.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.280
 - Yeah.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.840
 But like due to like how the market has been shaping

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.960
 up and things like that, no.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.760
 Like yeah, I clearly can't do that as much anymore.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.080
 Like I'm just gonna start doing what you do.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.760
 Like if I'm not using something all the time,

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.840
 fine, I can unrack it and set it aside for the moment.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.840
 And in a couple months, if I get the hankering

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.120
 to use it again, there it is.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.040
 And I just plug it back in.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:30.920
 - And there is a threshold.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.720
 If I'm, if somebody's sitting there in the box

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.120
 for like a year, all right, I'm not like a hoarder.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.640
 I can recognize our time together is done.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.960
 - But if it's like, I haven't used you for a couple of weeks,

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.000
 I gotta slow my role.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.480
 - I did something which kind of helped me in that

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:50.480
 got like online like 30 anti-static bags.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.840
 And I just have two shoe boxes.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.880
 And if there's a module that's like out of the mix,

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.240
 I like pop it in the anesthetic bag,

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.640
 sit it in the shoe box.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.520
 And then like I have a list of it and I'm like,

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.600
 oh, like a lot of them like, no one,

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.560
 I don't wanna sell somebody the neutron orgo

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:08.400
 and I made like 10 years ago when we both made those

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.960
 that I don't use 'cause it's like,

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.000
 not worth much money.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.720
 It's got like some issues and there's just a bunch

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:14.560
 of stuff like that.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.240
 I'm like, oh, maybe I'll use it again one day.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.000
 Like there's stuff like that I'm not gonna get rid of.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.240
 Like I've sold stuff that I made as a kit

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.720
 because I knew it was like, I'm like,

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.040
 oh, this is functioning like pretty much perfectly.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.320
 But for the most part, I'll kind of shy away from it.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.480
 Especially if there's even like a little issue.

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.160
 - And also if it's only a kit,

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.880
 fuck, I don't wanna make this thing again.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.720
 - Right.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.280
 - Yeah.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.880
 - So that was a very complicated answer.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.360
 Like we were all, there was no like to fit in it.

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.160
 - Like to fit in it for a second, yeah.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:48.840
 - Hopes and predictions are going to look to the future now.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:52.080
 - Why do I went through mine, which was the LZX

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.040
 and what it's gonna do to video stuff?

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.160
 I mean, hopes, no more ship shortages,

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.800
 no more companies going out of business,

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.520
 people can do this for a living, capitalism fails.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:06.520
 And a techno utopia takes over and--

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.320
 - God damn, Kami.

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.200
 - Yeah, so that's my hope.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.120
 Prediction is the opposite of that.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.920
 My prediction is that none of that's gonna come true.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:15.920
 - Yeah.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.760
 - So.

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.920
 Yeah, again, like there's not a whole lot

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.480
 that has been announced that I'm like really hyped for

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.920
 and feel like I need.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.240
 I'm still keeping a little space in my rack

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:31.480
 for industrial music electronics, folkmires and ferno.

01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.480
 But that's not a new hype.

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.560
 Like I've been hyped on that for years now.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.400
 - Yeah.

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.560
 - Just patiently waiting for Scott to get it right

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:44.200
 and hopefully get the components to make it happen.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.280
 And he says it's supposed to probably springtime, 2023.

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.680
 So we'll see.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.520
 - Yeah.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.320
 - That's on the horizon.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.400
 If that's still a legit timeframe.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.560
 And what else?

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:02.760
 Oh, I hope British noise electronics doesn't go under.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:03.600
 - Yeah.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.640
 - Seems like they might be.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.880
 I really hope not.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.440
 I would love to see what Ansem creates next

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.720
 or at the very least be able to keep producing

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.280
 his current lineup, love his stuff.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.640
 It's been a game changer for me this year.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.320
 So yeah, like, aside from that,

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.600
 I just feel like there hasn't been many announcements

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.000
 that I am like gassed up for on the horizon.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.640
 It's more like, you know,

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.680
 I just wanna see the manufacturers that I enjoy not fold.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:31.520
 Right?

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.360
 You know what I mean?

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.000
 - The lack of announcements is probably a reflection

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.840
 of the state of the industry right now.

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:37.680
 - Yeah.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.520
 Yeah.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.360
 I'm kind of similar.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.960
 Like I hope all these companies can keep going obviously,

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:46.040
 but I will probably not be the one helping out much

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.080
 in the next year.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.680
 And like, I'm always curious to see how that pans out.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680
 I know I've said that before.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.960
 Like, oh, I'm not gonna buy much this year.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.080
 I think I said that last year.

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.000
 And I got like way more like,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.880
 like shit cycle through than I could have imagined.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.000
 - Yeah.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.400
 But like you said, I'm not like, I'm super content.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.440
 I've said that before too,

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.440
 but there's nothing like I'm looking forward to.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.280
 Like I've kind of really figured out what I'm doing

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.440
 in some ways, like not sampling and shit,

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.200
 kind of lower complexity modules.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.240
 There are no more cases with room,

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.560
 like there's no more room

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.160
 and I don't have much more money to put towards this.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.160
 - I'm sort of, and I know I've said this as well

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.640
 in the past and then promptly violated.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.920
 I think I am at capacity for cases, for space.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:35.760
 And even just like the room that I work in,

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.040
 like if I need to get something, something else is going.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.640
 And that's gonna be a hard decision to make,

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.360
 but I don't see, for lack of a better word,

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.240
 my studio growing.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.880
 I only have so much room in my brain to organize

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.680
 what I wanna do and how I use it.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.760
 I don't want a big, huge, giant room full of shit

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.640
 and then become overwhelmed.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.160
 And I don't think I'm there, but I'm not there.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.000
 - That's where I'm at.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.160
 The cognitive, being able to deal with it,

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.840
 reducing some of those complex modules

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.640
 giving you less guilt, 'cause I feel bad

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.760
 if I don't use something that's sitting there too.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.520
 I feel like, oh, what's wrong with you

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.800
 that you're not using this thing?

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.960
 And I'm like, wait, that's the focus

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.080
 on finishing what you're trying to do

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.680
 and then figure, worry about the tools later.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.200
 And I was just so flipped with that for awhile.

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.040
 - Yeah.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.600
 I am curious to see what IntelliJel's still cooking up.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.440
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.280
 - What's Cascadia?

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.040
 - I don't know. - You still never announce.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.320
 Maybe it'll never happen, but I was curious.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.720
 - Yeah, there hasn't even been a lot of those type of teasers.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:38.080
 IntelliJel's stuff in general has been

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.920
 all out of stock and not being restocked a lot lately.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.920
 And I'm like, they've been really quiet.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.240
 And I'm like, fuck, don't be another company

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.080
 that's about to fold.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.360
 - Yeah, for real. - That would be huge.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:53.280
 - Yeah, I mean, WMD is still like fucking me up.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:54.840
 - That's a big thing, right? - Right, right.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:57.000
 I've relied on them for a good while.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.080
 Same with Mutable really bumps me out

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.040
 that they're ceasing all production now.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.480
 - Yeah.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.760
 - I mean, fuck, I think I still have more mutable stuff

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.320
 than anything.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:11.240
 Second up would be WMD and then probably IntelliJel.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.640
 - I have a secret hope that Emily from Mutable

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.120
 stops production, but then like starts working

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.800
 with someone else, like continues to design things

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.080
 and just has someone else make them.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:26.080
 Or Emily's involvement in doing stuff, I hope continues

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.560
 even if it isn't with Mutable.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.680
 So like, I don't know if that's the case.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:31.880
 I don't know if any kind of inside track.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.840
 That's my secret hope again, a hope for this year

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.480
 is that like the sort of plats out of the blue

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.680
 firmware, they were obviously working on this.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.480
 What are they working on right now?

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.400
 Some surprise thing in May or late next year

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.320
 and it isn't mutable, it's something else.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.280
 - I hope that's what happens.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.680
 - Yeah.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.560
 I'll make a bold prediction that I hope isn't necessarily true,

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.720
 but I bet that Make Noise will go under.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.560
 - Really?

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.400
 - Hope it's not true.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.040
 How many maths can one produce before the market saturated?

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:04.880
 - Yeah.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.480
 Yeah, I feel like--

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.840
 - Don't want it to happen.

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:09.680
 - Right.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.000
 - WMD fell though.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.200
 - Yeah.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.840
 - Wait, has Make Noise been making a lot of videos?

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.480
 I feel like that's dried up.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.280
 I didn't even really put it together,

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.920
 but for a while they were for a moment.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.240
 - They were making a lot of videos.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.720
 - Like how to use Strega.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.520
 - Yeah, and some of them were like guest stars.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.360
 - Yeah.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.360
 - And like guest stars showing up

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:31.640
 and they were all really well produced and all that.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.320
 It occurred to me that just as you said,

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.600
 I'm like, "Then, while since I've seen one of those."

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:38.080
 - Yeah, how many O-coasts can they sell?

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.160
 Like, I don't know, maybe like, I don't know.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.680
 Maybe they're doing just fucking great

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.840
 and laughing and hearing this if they listen to it.

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.680
 - Right.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.160
 - Hope so, but something, I don't know.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:49.920
 Let's think a few more.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.680
 People will kind of be out of the mix.

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:57.680
 - Yeah, I will say I've been seeing more manufacturers

01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:59.840
 popping up in VCV.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.680
 - Yeah.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:03.720
 - A lot of new hardware clones,

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.000
 which I'm totally cool with ALM.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.160
 - Yeah, I'm just honest.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.160
 - Do you want a few?

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:13.160
 Even Dope for Wasp filter is now ported into the VCV.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.720
 And I think that's what we discussed last year.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.560
 - Yeah, we did.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:23.280
 - We did was that maybe people who have good concepts

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.320
 and don't want to completely fold,

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.600
 but don't have the components or the finances

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.720
 to release a module could adapt to,

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.800
 software renditions of their ideas.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.000
 I'm not saying VCV rack is the end all be all.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.840
 There's plenty of options out there to port your code to,

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:47.680
 but VCV has been growing steadily over the last year.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.440
 I was just getting into VCV too.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.520
 Last year during this wrap up episode,

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.560
 they had just announced 2.0, if I recall.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:01.120
 And 2.0 has grown tremendously over the last year.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.360
 A lot of innovation going on within it.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.000
 Third party people and just straight up VCV modules.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.200
 Like just last week they released two new modules,

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.720
 a reverb module and a convolution reverb module.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.640
 - I saw that.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.240
 - And they're nice.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.080
 - Oh, cool.

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:18.920
 - I like them a lot.

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.520
 And one thing that I will definitely give props

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:26.240
 to VCV designers for is that they,

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.080
 like I said last time,

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.400
 they keep the spirit of modular alive with their designs.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.960
 Like, they're not like, well, hey, this is software.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:37.840
 So we can load it with 100 fucking options on this panel.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.920
 Like they're not doing that.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.680
 They're keeping it to the point,

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:45.680
 modules are meant to be a more focused approach.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.800
 It's like not per function.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.760
 There's not much buried underneath it.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.120
 - Oh, we have the option for a dropdown.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.200
 Let's do dropdown.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.040
 - Oh, God.

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.960
 - You know, like the temptation to do that,

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.840
 I imagine is very high.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.600
 - And some people do on the third party stuff,

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.400
 but it seems like for the most part, VCV is keeping it real.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.560
 And so I'm glad that they've released a bunch of effects

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.560
 over the last couple of months

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.040
 that were like, they sound good.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.800
 They're not, you know,

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.280
 it doesn't give me option paralysis.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.720
 When I look at the panel,

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.480
 you know, it's like they're easy to use.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.160
 They serve the purpose and I like it a lot.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.680
 My hybrid setup has been giving me more productivity

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.200
 than anything else has in a while.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.680
 So.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:29.520
 - Nice.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.360
 - Yeah.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.800
 - I will say too, it was cool to see the

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.880
 System 80 Mark II modules were announced a couple of days ago.

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:37.720
 - Oh, were they?

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.400
 - I missed it.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.920
 - There's a new oscillator, modulator,

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.080
 and then the 810 are all Mark II,

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.440
 and they should be out like some time middle of next year.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.280
 - Cool.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.800
 - So we're glad to see them keep in going.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:54.320
 Again, like Jeff was super helpful when my 810 needed to be fixed.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.520
 And now I can say that they also were super solid

01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.200
 and sent me back a prototype of the Mark II of the 810.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.840
 And so I have two of them now,

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.640
 which is amazing having dual oscillators.

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.520
 The 810 has some good features, like super generous,

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.600
 super helpful with getting it fixed and everything paid

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.680
 for like shipping halfway.

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.000
 All I had to do is pay to get it shipped there.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.360
 And they were really transparent like,

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.920
 hey, like we found the issue.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.240
 Yeah, this potentiometer, trim pause broken.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:23.160
 Like we're gonna burn it in for a week.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.040
 Did everything they said they would.

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:25.880
 - Nice.

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:26.720
 - System 80 rules.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.320
 Yeah, really, really happy with them.

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.280
 And the shit sounds like that's,

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.360
 could have been one of my favorite sound sources for sure,

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:35.000
 but it's been my favorite, one of them for a couple of years now.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:35.840
 - Nice.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.680
 - Well by Greg's rule where time doesn't fucking matter

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.080
 'cause it's a flat circle, could have included it.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.520
 - That's true.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.360
 It is a flat circle.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.440
 - Just so we can make our own rules.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.800
 - Whenever a filter, whenever it was made,

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:51.040
 whenever you got it can be in a best of 2022 list.

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.160
 - Everything you've done, Dave.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.240
 - We'll do again.

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.080
 (laughing)

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.200
 - Again and again.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.400
 - I feel like you should have cracked a beer

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.240
 at the end of that.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.080
 - Yeah.

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.660
 (upbeat music)

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.900
 (beeping)

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:21.900
 - Hold on, dang it, Greg.

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:24.540
 - I'd chosen my Scrag.

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:27.220
 - What?

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:28.220
 (laughing)

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:30.180
 - It's like nails on chalkboard to me, dude, I can't.

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.460
 - I did not know that about you, Greg.

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:32.300
 - Yeah.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.140
 - I don't know about that.

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.860
 It literally sends a chill at my spine

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:37.100
 with people chewing on ice.

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.500
 - I can just feel it hurting and freezing my teeth

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.780
 and it just sends this shiver at my spine.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:42.780
 It's weird.

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:45.340
 - Oh, it's supposed to hurt your teeth.

01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.660
 - I remember in high school there was this kid

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:49.180
 who maintained that you could grow back brain cells

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:51.140
 because something happens when you chew on ice

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.220
 and I'll never forget that.

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.060
 - Whoa.

01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:54.900
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:55.980
 It's like something in there.

01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:57.340
 - It's just like, it's like,

01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:58.180
 fucking narrow on the floor.

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:01.060
 - Silicon Valley, Neutropic secret right there.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.180
 - Yeah, chewing on ice.

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.580
 - The real alpha brain.

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:05.060
 (laughing)

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.500
 - Chewin' on some fucking ice.
