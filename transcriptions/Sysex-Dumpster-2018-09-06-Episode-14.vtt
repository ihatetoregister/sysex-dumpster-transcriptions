00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 [Music]

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.500
 What's been going on? What are we drinking? Summer in Pittsburgh.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.500
 We've been away for a little. Drinking the Rhine Geist knowledge.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.500
 Knowledge? It's an Imperial IPA? It's fantastic.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.500
 Sounds pretentious. It's real pretentious. I've got a fury. This one's pretentious. It's got a really fancy label.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 Fury brewing series of sweet karate moves. Jesus Christ.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.500
 But it's a New England style IPA, which is the cloudy one, Senna. I like this. It's pretty, it's okay.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 That can is a little hard to look at. It's way over the top. It's got like a fucking gumbie.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 Oh, that's a fucking night man, dude. From "It's Always Sunny." Oh, Jesus Christ. I didn't even realize that.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 Okay. Now it's redeemed itself a good bit. Okay. I fuck with that.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 That is a night man. Showing you his karate moves. I dig it. You've got a Laquat.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.500
 I do. I haven't had the extra fancy shit in a while, so I got a couple cases of the cherry lime.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 However you pronounce it. Sirelimon? I don't think I've had it either. I didn't even try that one. It's a good.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.500
 It's my favorite. Oh, I'm not even trying to cherry flavor. The fuck is wrong with you?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 Well, I just only fucked up. You don't like a nice slice of cherry pie?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.500
 I don't like cherry flavoring. Okay. Like fake cherry.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.500
 I got shitty cherry popsicle. You don't like those? No, no. I usually go for the grape. I like fake grapes.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 Really? I like grape. Oh, fake grapes. All my life, dude. Like, fake grapes. I've never been a fan of grape, but I'll try anything that's cherry.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 Anything bread, dude. Any candy. Jolly rancher, starburst, whatever. I want that cherry.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 Jolly rancher, there's only one. Sour apple. You're crazy.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 This watermelon cherry sour apple? I could fuck with those three for a long time.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.500
 I don't eat anything except the cherry. I'll buy a variety bag and the rest will just sit there forever.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.500
 I'll just eat all the cherries. Once the reds are gone, I'm like, "Alright, this is garbage."

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 You can just buy a bag of the red, right? Yeah, sometimes I can't find them, though.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.500
 So I get a variety and just to get the reds and get a slingshot and then cherry jelly bellies.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.500
 That's where it's at, dude. Those are fucking good.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.500
 You don't like it. No, not for me. No, I'm surprised, dude. I thought that was like a standard, like, everyone.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500
 Different structure, different folks, man. Yeah, I feel you.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.500
 I just turned my modular on today for the first time in months listeners. It was fucking fun.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.500
 You weren't using it for your most recent set. Nope. In any way, just virus, blow-felt, rhythm, TR8S.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.500
 Nice. TV3. That was it. Cool. Yeah. How you digging the TR8S live?

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.500
 It's good. It's way better than the original. They made it way more complicated to switch individual instruments for each one.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:21.500
 I don't like that. Sounds great. Worked fine. No issues alive. Yeah, I like it. It's good.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.500
 I haven't even played with the samples on it yet. Haven't tried that shit at all, but I'm looking forward to getting a little further into it.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.500
 Paired well with the rhythm filled in those gaps kind of well, just for the standard.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.500
 Clubby techno shit that I wanted to kind of pepper in.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.500
 Are you still on the original Mark I and Riddemartu? Or did you get that too? Yeah, I'm kind of like...

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.500
 I'm a little scared about some of the stuff I've heard about the Mark II and issues, and I just really like the Mark I.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.500
 The knob, the macro knob on the Mark II, is pretty appealing to me, but...

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.500
 Oh yeah, and I actually backed it up for the first time ever. Now that they've made that latest update, you can get the samples out of the rhythm for the first time.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.500
 So that was cool. Yeah, I kind of missed mine.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 Messing with that sequencer reminded me of some of the things that I miss about it. You know what I mean?

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.500
 Oh, the Erica. Yeah. Because it's very similar. How it's all set up. The menus and everything.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.500
 But while we're on the topic of electron...

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.500
 Many updates. And heat Mark II.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.500
 Oh, I knew we had to get it back.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.500
 That actually slipped in my mind when I was making my list of shit to talk about, but it just popped back.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.500
 Talking about the Riddem. I don't even know the difference is.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:41.500
 They're like... isn't one? It's like a slightly different screen, and I think it's going to be better for overbridge or some shit.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:51.500
 I can't remember, but seeing the backlash on every internet forum has just been a fun spectator sport.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.500
 So we were noticing that there's no difference.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.500
 Oh, dude. People are pissed. Like, Mark I hasn't even been out for like two years.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.500
 Right.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.500
 People that have been like, you know, just getting them in our hands and they're being told that this is end-of-life hardware.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.500
 You should get a Mark II.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:14.500
 Right. It's more expensive for no fucking reason. Like the Mark I was kind of, in my opinion, a rip to begin with.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.500
 It's a lot of money. Yeah. How much is the Mark II?

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.500
 It's like 850 or something. I can't remember. I mean, it was already a lot.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:31.500
 Yeah. For a stereo single effect kind of thing. Well, it has multiple effects, but you're going to process one of them at a time kind of.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.500
 And for stereo distortion pedals, that's pretty damn pricey. Right.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.500
 You get a lot of the stuff that does similar things.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.500
 Seems popular. I don't know. The Mark II thing, they've always been bad at Mark IIs. They've always like... I don't know.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.500
 It just seems like such a minimal shift to qualify as a Mark II, you know.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.500
 Now, there's supposed to be something under the hood that's different.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.500
 I mean, is it one of those things where maybe like eventually it'll be different because the hardware has been expanded?

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.500
 I think they said, yes, it's supposed to be better hardware or something, but...

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.500
 Sounds better. That's one of their first bullet points. Sound better.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.500
 Did you fuck up the last one?

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.500
 If it came down to it, after hearing how it sounds like and playing with one,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.500
 I would still pick a Sherman, even though the Sherman isn't stereo.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.500
 Right. You know what I mean? It just, I don't know.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.500
 I feel like the filters sound way better, way more versatile.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.500
 You can't save presets and shit like you can on the heat, but...

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.500
 For me, distortion is usually like you dial it in and then you leave it to fuck alone.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500
 You know what I mean? I don't know.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.500
 I will give them some props and that they released all those updates at once, and at least like...

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.500
 The rhythm update worked. I used it live. I've had no issues with it.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.500
 So at least like props to doing the testing and at least like...

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.500
 Let's not give you this quasi beta test kind of version and let you stumble through it.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.500
 It's been solid.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.500
 Honestly, I'd love to get, I was thinking about this yesterday, I'd love to get like a new inbox rhythm,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.500
 mark one if I had infinite money and just like put it back.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.500
 They're like, all right, there's my backup.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.500
 Right, so never fucks up. That's how much it's like kind of key for me.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.500
 That's what I did with my ES1, but my backup cost $100, so it was not much of a huge investment,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:18.500
 but I want this thing that I can load all the shit I've been working on in case something catastrophic happens,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.500
 but when you're talking about something, it's that pricey.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.500
 I have two pyramid sequences right now for that very reason.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:30.500
 Like I'm the second one used. I actually have to ship my first one back again to actually get the touchpad fixed.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.500
 But I was working on that set and I was like, fuck this, I'll sell it again or something,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.500
 but I'm gonna like, I'm not gonna have this fuck up on me halfway.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.500
 I'm gonna have to like scramble to get something going.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.500
 Because you had a lot of stuff running off that pyramid.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.500
 Oh yeah.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.500
 I mean, just standing there watching you that whole time in the creepiest way possible.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.500
 That's what I was just, you know, like I was hiding in the shadows and like, it was weird.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.500
 Like the club had like these sort of like Venetian blinds and I was able to like separate two of them

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.500
 and look at you so you could just see my two eyeballs.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.500
 I don't know why they set that up for me, but they did.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.500
 So I was able to creep on you the whole time and I could tell like so much was running off the pyramid

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.500
 and that shit the bed.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.500
 Yeah.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.500
 It would have been try to pivot to set the clock up differently really quickly and run the rest of the stuff,

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.500
 the drum machines and the TB3 because it would have been tanked.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.500
 I was almost gonna bring the backup in the car just in case that one fucked up.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.500
 Because it was wiggling like the power supply and it was starting to glitch out and I could reset it

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.500
 and I was like, oh shit, this is another thing I'm gonna tell them about.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.500
 And I think it was the actual power supply that came with my first one and the used one that I got

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.500
 actually has a better one and I could jiggle it and it wouldn't fuck up at all.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.500
 But yeah, I love the thing as far as sequencing goes.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.500
 Like it's that thing works with my brain perfectly.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.500
 And someone who hasn't used it, it looked like wizardry and sorcery.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.500
 I fucked up like twice that I can remember where I was like, ooh, unmuted because I was using program changes

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.500
 on the blowfeld.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.500
 So if I unmute the wrong track it would switch the patch, which was bad.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.500
 And the one time I caught it like real quick before it did it.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.500
 But that was the only time I like fucked it up.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.500
 So the practice helped the constant endless practice.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.500
 But yeah, pyramid definitely.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.500
 I'm using the older version of the OS because the newest beta one, it seems like you were saying

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.500
 with the Digitech like old projects won't load and I was just like,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.500
 I'm gonna check that out later if I can.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.500
 But hopefully they get it all straightened out.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.500
 So you're gonna be recording or anything of that sort?

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.500
 There is, I just got it yesterday actually.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.500
 And the levels are all good.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.500
 Yeah.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:31.500
 I definitely like I was listening to it just to kind of get feedback to myself.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.500
 I rushed through some stuff too quickly because it just seems like I'll get bored up there.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.500
 And I'll switch it.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.500
 And per day when I talked about this earlier, sometimes it's like, oh, well,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.500
 I was never wanting you to switch something up.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.500
 It was always something else coming along the line.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.500
 But some of the times I feel like I just got bored and like stopped something and people

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.500
 were really liking the acid lines and the TV three stuff and I would like go back to that quick.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.500
 So the sequencing of it was a little disappointing.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.500
 But everything else I was happy with like were mixed levels and everything.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.500
 They were good, no overdriven anything.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.500
 So yeah, the setup worked.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.500
 I'm gonna keep rolling with that the next time if there, whenever that happens.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.500
 The PA just sounded.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.500
 This is like the shout out to the Hot Mouse PA.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.500
 It's fucking incredible.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.500
 I missed.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.500
 [laughter]

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.500
 Because it wasn't until like two fifteen or something.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.500
 Yeah, it's pretty late.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.500
 Yeah, I was starting there.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.500
 I was like, well, time's nickel and all of them.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.500
 He was like, two.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.500
 And I was like, fuck.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.500
 I just worked all day as an album.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.500
 Try.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.220
 But then like by 11 p.m. that day, because I had slept for like four fucking hours and

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.500
 I was supposed to do a shift the next day.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.500
 I was like, I can't fucking do it.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.500
 But I was really hoping that there would be a recording.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.500
 I'm glad to hear that there is.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.500
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.500
 I'll send it along.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.500
 We had planned to do the disco nap thing and then just like.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.500
 Yeah, that was my original crown and didn't do it.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.500
 And it was like getting in the car to go over.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.500
 I was like, oh man, I hope I got it in me.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:00.500
 I think like once I got out and like breath of fresh air like took like a B12 and like,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.500
 I can do this.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.500
 But I have to admit, I was a little worried.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.500
 I was like, we fucked this up.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.500
 Yeah, I was worried about just being able to run it all at two in the morning because

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.500
 it's still like, I will say today the practice that we got in.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.500
 I forgot I even got the Intel Gel dual ADSR until I reopened the case.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.500
 I was like, oh yeah, you got that.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.500
 That's a good choice.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.500
 And it was using it today, just having the release on sliders and being able to like,

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.500
 oh, I'm going to open the sound up real quick with the slider.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.500
 That's fucking solid module and digging it.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.500
 Yeah, I missed the envelope actually.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.500
 And it has like basically like two different modes.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.500
 It's got three.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.500
 It's got the, well, it's got cycle on and off and then you've got three speeds right in

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.500
 envelope, which is cool.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.500
 Fuck, because I've got the quadra, right?

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.500
 Which is nice.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.500
 And I end up using all four of the envelope generators.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.500
 I was like, I don't know.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.500
 I did ADSRs looking pretty nice.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.500
 See, I was getting straight up planar jealousy.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:00.500
 Fuck, it's like, it's the only thing I kind of want right now as a planar in addition.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.500
 And joysticks are pretty nice for sound design.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.500
 Yeah, yeah, they are.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.500
 And the planar too, I think, has got some interesting new features.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.500
 The recording thing, I think, is probably the most like whiz-bank thing they added.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.500
 Yeah.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.500
 I don't know if it's really necessary.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.500
 That's how I feel.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.500
 I don't know if I need that.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.500
 Especially with the X and Y taking CV.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.500
 Yeah, then what do you need to record for to send it to sequence?

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.500
 And that's what I do.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.500
 I mean, not for what we were doing today.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.500
 Because you can even have X and Y CV on it and still use the joystick and move it around.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.500
 Right.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.500
 And then the X and Y CV gets applied on top of its current position.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.500
 The recorder just seems superfluous.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.500
 Like when does it start and stop?

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.500
 I don't know.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.500
 I don't know.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.500
 It opens up questions.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.500
 I don't want to answer.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.500
 [LAUGHS]

00:12:45.500 --> 00:13:13.500
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.500
 Those knobs on the gristle-izer, those are the original?

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.500
 No, no.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:23.500
 The red ones are different and they were a much larger knob.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.500
 That's what I thought.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.500
 I don't like those as much.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:33.500
 And I think this also helps me remember which one is the knob that is more destructive.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:38.500
 It's basically the criteria for what's going to be red and which is just black.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.500
 It's a lot of knobs on there.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.500
 Yeah.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.500
 Yeah, there is.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.500
 Yeah, you've got the full-size knobs and these tiny little guys.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.500
 A lot of ins and outs on that thing.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.500
 Yeah.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.500
 Yeah.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.500
 The one that has the crazy ins and outs is the generator.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.500
 It's basically like an LFO.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.500
 And a lot of this comes based on the wave folding that's built into it.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.500
 There's a lot of synchronization.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.500
 You can actually send it tracks one volt per octave and it also takes a sync in.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.500
 And the fold itself has its own controls, this gain and offset and frequency.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.500
 And those are also C-viable.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:24.500
 And then the output is either just the raw ramps or pulse and then just the normal folded

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.500
 output.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:31.500
 So that's why this bank here is just kind of nuts with inputs and outputs.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:37.500
 And the preamp has this big guitar input jack.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.500
 But this stuff here is in this tiny square here.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.500
 That's all based on the envelope follower.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.500
 So that's--

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.500
 So as follower two?

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.500
 Yes, yes it does.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:54.500
 And there's how do you load up the hamburger lady preset?

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.500
 The what now?

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.500
 Yeah, and there's a sensitivity on the table.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.500
 You use the follower a lot?

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.500
 No, no I don't.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.500
 Because I've plugged the cello in just to get a sense of what it was like because I don't

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.500
 even have a guitar to test the guitar input.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.500
 And just screwing with it I was able to see what it does but honestly no, I've not done

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.500
 much with the follower.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.500
 I think if I was using this more with a guitar it would probably be really useful.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500
 Yeah.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500
 My throbbing gristle joke fell flat.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.500
 I got it.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.500
 I just--

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.500
 It took me a second.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.500
 Yeah, no I was in the zone of explanation.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.500
 Yeah, no.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.500
 I was trying to throw your curve all there.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.500
 And you successfully did.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.500
 And so these are the inputs and outputs for the filter.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500
 They're basically what you would expect.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.500
 There's an input, an output, and then the two CVs.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:53.500
 One is actually normal to the generator.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.500
 And then finally the last thing over here is they call the modulator.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.500
 But it's a VCA.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.500
 And it's similarly what you would expect.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.500
 Inputs, outputs, and CV control.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.500
 So those are reasonable numbers of jacks.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.500
 So is there any audio rate sound generation on it?

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.500
 Like can you kick that generator up to like audio rate level or is it mostly for like accepting

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.500
 sources and processing stuff?

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.500
 Real low end.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.500
 I think it goes up to like 400.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.500
 But it doesn't give very high above that.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.500
 And even then you are limited to a very limited number of shapes.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.500
 So it goes from saw to reverse saw.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.500
 And then the wave folder itself will give you like a little bit of dimension on top of

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.500
 that.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.500
 But it doesn't have a huge variety of different shapes.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.500
 But I mean between all of these different controls, you can actually make some cool stuff.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:53.500
 And you got the super limited version where everything is on one panel.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.500
 It's one module.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.500
 That stuff has a bunch of things that are like normalized.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.500
 They are.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:05.500
 And they actually, this is a panel, like you said, this is one panel instead of being all

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.500
 four modules, individual.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:14.500
 So there's like a sort of like dotted line that shows you what's normal and what isn't.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.500
 And then you can just break them if you need to, if you plug something in.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.500
 But all the normalizations make sense.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.500
 You go from master output goes directly into the input on the filter.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:30.500
 The fold output of the generator goes into the CV input, CV2 input for both the filter and

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.500
 the VCA.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.500
 How does it sound Dave?

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.500
 It does.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.500
 Sounds fucking amazing.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.500
 Yeah, huge fan.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.500
 I could plug it in and make some sounds.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.500
 Like I said, I knew I was going to run out of ways to say dirty.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.500
 Grimey.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.500
 There's a little bit of grime.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.500
 There's a little bit of filth.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.500
 Nasty.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.500
 Soiled.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.500
 Very soiled.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.500
 Are we done?

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.500
 Do we got more?

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.500
 Shit.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.500
 I don't have to top my head.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.500
 Other synonyms for filthy?

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.500
 I'm thinking.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.500
 Yeah, I'm thinking.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.500
 Disobedient.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.500
 Impear.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.500
 Yeah, impure.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.500
 Litterbox.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.500
 It's actually the hot one.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:14.500
 Litterbox.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.500
 It's actually the highest level of purity.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:23.500
 So if you were to break it up into four modules, what are the two that you would pick?

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.500
 If you had to pick only two of them.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.500
 What I thought was going to be the most interesting one, the one I was only going to get at first,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.500
 was the filter.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.500
 Honestly, I don't think I would get that.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:38.500
 If I only could get two, it would be the preamp and the modulator, the preamp and the VCA.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.500
 They add the most teeth to things.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.500
 The modulator in particular is pretty versatile.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.500
 We can get kind of clean.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.500
 I wouldn't want it to be my only VCA.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:58.500
 But between the bias, the dirt, and it has its own drive, dialing all of that in just takes you away.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.500
 It takes me away to another place.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.500
 If I had to boil it down to one, I would probably just be the modulator.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.500
 It's a pretty versatile module.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:14.500
 The preamp, though, even though I'm not using the guitar input, just having it also has a lot of character to everything that you're doing.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.500
 I'm throwing gristle ran pretty much everything through those.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.500
 That's my understanding.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.500
 Focal processing.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.500
 Violin.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.500
 Shit.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.500
 Yeah.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:28.500
 Even just like I said, just running the cello through it, it just turned, it just destroyed it.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.500
 We could be running this episode through it and get, you know, see what it's like.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.500
 You're saving that for your next live performance, right?

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.500
 Exactly.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.500
 Yeah.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.500
 When you do acapellas.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.500
 Yes.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:48.500
 But like in my idea of what singing is like, which is not that dissimilar from like King Diamond, it's like a really dodgy falsetto.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.500
 So hopefully the gristleizer will be able to handle that.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.500
 I think it can.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.500
 What about feeding it back into itself?

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.500
 Ah!

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.500
 Fucking amazing.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.500
 Yeah, all those ins and outs, that's like the first thing that's popping in my head.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.500
 I just want to route things back into itself.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.500
 See what happens.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.500
 Such an expanded version of like what I've always known as the gristleizer.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.500
 You know what I mean?

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.500
 I mean, I should have it on the filter, but like it's only just because it didn't meet my expectation.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.500
 The more I use it, the more I really do like it.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:24.500
 Kinda reminds me of the spectral divisator, the other future sound system model that I had.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:31.500
 It just, it's squelches, but for lack of a better term, it's like a, it's like a slow burn squelch.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.500
 I'm not going to be making 303 bass lines on it.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.500
 No, no, no, not at all.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.500
 It's, it, it, it, it, it burns, it's like a burning squelch.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:44.500
 But like it starts like just a little bit, and then you know, you got like a quarter of a turn of the knob before it becomes unbearable.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.500
 It doesn't just like collapse right away.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.500
 I want to hear sounds of it now.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.500
 I can turn it on.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.500
 Turn it on.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.500
 Turn it on.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:58.500
 Turn it on.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:05.500
 Turn it on.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:12.500
 Turn it off.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.500
 What are you hearing right now?

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:23.500
 Okay, so that is just a, like a real simple oscillator going into the preamp through everything into the output.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:35.500
 So you're getting the preamp, the filter, and the modulator, and also some pretty high modulation from the generator itself at a pretty high frequency.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.500
 Let me, it sounds like a bad day.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.500
 So this is, this will be skipping the, the generator and the filter.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.500
 [ [

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.500
 ]

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.500
 So that's about as close as it's going to get to being clean.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.500
 [

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.500
 ]

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.500
 So that's like a little bit of dirt.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:07.500
 [

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:24.500
 ]

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:32.500
 All right, so that's with the modulator, a little bit of dirt, and then a lot of the CV modulation from the generator.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.500
 It's preamp in here.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:34.500

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:48.500
 ]

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.500
 All right, so that's what the, the generator slowed down a little bit.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:58.500
 And the other thing too is these lights dictate, give you an idea of how much, like how strong the input signal is.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.500
 Oh, what do you got there?

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.500
 Is that for input?

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:51.260
 - Did you get this little graphic block?

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.180
 - A stew top, I didn't know what left.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.060
 - I did, left for a while.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.700
 - Yeah, and now it's back.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.800
 - Oh, shit.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.600
 I sold it for, shit, one was it, a few months back.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.000
 I sold it because I wanted the space, because it's big.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.840
 - Yeah.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.680
 - And I used this space that I freed up with

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.960
 to get more drum modules and things like that,

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.320
 but I've done some serious restructuring,

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.920
 and I realized I had the space for one again,

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.120
 and somebody was selling one used on muffs

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.920
 for pretty damn cheap.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.400
 Now, when I first bought it,

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.160
 I bought it as a drum module in mind.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.080
 You know what I mean, which it's pretty good for, obviously.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.240
 But now with all the drum modules that I have,

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.360
 I realize I don't need that as a drum module.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.360
 Like I bought it again more as a lo-fi texture maker.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.560
 - No.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.380
 - You know what I mean?

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.380
 I don't know how else to describe it

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.160
 other than like a noise box.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.000
 You know what I mean?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.640
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.160
 - A little chip tune noise machine.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.160
 I think it excels in that,

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.200
 and I like processing it through things

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.160
 like the rain maker and things like that.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.000
 - No.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.040
 - Those two modules together,

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.040
 I can get like endless,

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.640
 grimy, strange sounds out of.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.240
 Yeah, I didn't think anyone would notice.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.000
 - Oh, you can't get over on me.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.120
 I do notice those two transients,

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.600
 some kind of waiting for your feedback on.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.740
 Future retro transients, that is.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.080
 - Well, those are a little bit more obvious

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.480
 'cause the gold plating,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.320
 this really stands there.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.160
 - They're the mark.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.000
 - The mark.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.840
 - The fuck looking at them.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.000
 They are probably the ugliest modules I've ever owned.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.200
 (laughing)

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.840
 No, Joe, and I even replaced the knobs on them

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.680
 like I tend to do,

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.840
 but the knobs were these gigantic like

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.040
 50s refrigerator style dials.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.200
 - Oh, God.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.320
 - Silver on top of the gold.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.160
 - Ah.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.680
 - Yeah, it was terrible.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.600
 I was like, these knobs are going like.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.440
 - No, do you think they were being hilarious?

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.800
 We could make something nice, but let's be funny.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.600
 - I don't know 'cause Future retro,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.360
 all their stuff has always looked kind of,

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.440
 their aesthetic choices have never been that great.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.280
 - I like the excess a little, the gray one.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.280
 - Oh, that's the only one.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.800
 - Everything else is like, fuck.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.840
 - Fuck, what did I used to have?

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.840
 I used to have that acid box

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.800
 - The revolution. - The revolution.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.880
 - The revolution. - Yeah, yeah.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.400
 - God damn it's a dead thing.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.760
 - Oh, yeah, it looks like a giant UFO.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.760
 - They made a glow in the dark one too.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.120
 - It's like, 'cause you know,

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.400
 why would you want to sequence in a straight line, dude?

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.400
 Like, let's make it in a circle.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.600
 - That's what the squares do, man.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.600
 - You gotta think outside of the back.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.760
 - Can't make it that way.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.000
 - I love that machine though.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.680
 I just hated the look of it.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.520
 - Yeah.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.680
 - And it's the same applies to these future retro,

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.960
 transient pluses.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.160
 Like, can't stand to look at them,

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.280
 but they are pretty damn cool.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.960
 - Do you hear that magpie?

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.800
 Just saying.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.880
 - Yeah, if there was an alternative panel

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.720
 that came out for these,

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.440
 I would swap in an instant for sure.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.920
 - So they're like, they're sample based,

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.640
 but you can fuck 'em up, kind of, right?

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.760
 They have like some effects on board and stuff.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.080
 - They have a lot on board, yeah.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.320
 More than I realized, they get pretty deep.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.800
 But yeah, it's a sample based module.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.680
 It does all of its processing 16-bit,

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.400
 but then it goes through a 12-bit DAC

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.160
 to give it a little bit of like that old sampler grime.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.640
 - And you can tweak that down to like one bit, if you want.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.080
 - Oh, sweetly shit.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:19.920
 - Yeah. - That's cool.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.240
 - Plus it has on board distortion and some mode,

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.440
 it's called Compounder, which is supposed to be

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.320
 like also reminiscent of older gear.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.760
 Almost everything in there is tweakable.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.600
 - Oh nice.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:38.560
 - It has on board filters, two on board modulation oscillators,

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.880
 which can function at LFO or audio rates.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.720
 - Shit.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:46.240
 - And you can map these to pretty much anything in there.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.920
 The sample selection, the filter that's on board,

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.640
 you can get real crazy with it.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.560
 Supposedly, you can also change the playback speed

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:01.280
 from like plus one octave down to minus five octave.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.120
 - That's awesome.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.000
 - Yeah, I haven't figured out how to do that yet.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.680
 I haven't gotten that deep into it,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.440
 but like it's pretty wild.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.800
 And everything in it, you save it as an instrument,

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.280
 which is basically a preset.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.720
 It's a set of parameters, all the modulation stuff,

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.000
 everything gets saved in there.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.320
 And you can have up to 256 of these instruments on there.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.880
 So, I'll be into that.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.600
 - Yeah, that's pretty hefty.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.480
 - It all gets stored on the card.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:31.200
 You can have up to, I think 600 samples or 16 megabyte,

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.480
 which is kind of small.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.040
 So you're not gonna be putting anything long in there.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.440
 It's all gonna be like short one shot type stuff,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.040
 but it does have weird options for looping also.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.960
 Like if you could stick an amen break in there,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:48.600
 then tweak like start end points and weird shit like that.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.360
 It's interesting, way deeper than I expected.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.440
 - So there's, I saw that there was a screen.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.200
 What is the screen actually showing you?

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.440
 - Everything that's in the menu.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.840
 Okay, so there's total five knobs.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.800
 Top two are just CV attenuators.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.840
 Like if you don't wanna use the onboard modulation,

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.160
 you can map external to whatever.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.560
 You have two CV inputs with attenuators.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.840
 The bottom knobs K1K2, you can assign to things

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.160
 or multiple things like macro knobs basically.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.080
 So you can tweak things with those.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.960
 Then the middle knob is what selects things

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.240
 on the menu screen.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.320
 - Oh, that's cool.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.760
 - Yeah, you scroll with that and then you push in to select.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.600
 - Cool.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.440
 - Kind of like braids.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.280
 - Yeah.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.120
 - It reminds me a lot of braids.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.120
 Like everything is pretty much like one level deep

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.360
 or pretty close to it.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.960
 - Yeah, it's a lot of functionality packed in there.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.280
 I see you have two and before we started recording,

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.280
 you mentioned something about alternative firmware.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.360
 - Yeah, they are releasing,

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.360
 I don't wanna call it alternative firmware.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.360
 - But you should because that's what I said.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.160
 - But it kind of is.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.000
 You know what I mean?

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.840
 (laughing)

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.240
 'Cause it's essentially the same firmware

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.000
 but it will contain different instruments

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.480
 and sound selection and things like that.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.760
 But like the one is all full of like video game sounds

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.120
 and like instruments inspired from like, you know,

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.440
 Atari stuff, things like that.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.280
 - Oh, that's cool.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.960
 - And sounds interesting, yeah.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.160
 - I am sitting here staring at this over stare

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.280
 modular channel, which I think we would be fucked up

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.200
 to not mention 'cause holy shit does it sound good.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.320
 It makes me feel some type of way.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.520
 Some type of way.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.560
 - So you're pretty fired up about this.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.880
 - So much so though, I wasn't sure

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.440
 I was even gonna talk about it

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.960
 because I could probably just sit here and like,

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.320
 just what's the word?

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.160
 - Gosh.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.000
 - Gosh, thank you.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.840
 - Yeah.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.480
 - Yeah, I could definitely gush

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.800
 about the overstayer modular channel.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.680
 - For our listeners, why don't you give them

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.600
 like a quick executive summary or elevator pitch

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.320
 for what you're talking about?

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:55.880
 - Well, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.960
 That's for sure.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.120
 It's definitely a very specialized thing.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:01.960
 You know what I mean?

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.600
 Like it does what it does and it does it very fucking well.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.080
 But if you're not like obsessed with fine-tuning

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.880
 your distortion, you're probably not gonna give

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.840
 a flying fuck about it.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.840
 It's gonna sound like your analog heat

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.360
 or whatever VST you use for distortion.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.360
 You know what I mean?

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.200
 - Yeah.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.480
 - And I hate to sound pretentious about it,

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.640
 but I think it's earned it here.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.440
 You know, the high praise.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.440
 I like distortion.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.360
 You know what I mean?

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.240
 It's, this thing is by far the best thing

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.400
 I've ever used for distortion.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.240
 - Yeah, you know, it's--

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.000
 - But it's not just a raw distortion pedal.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.080
 It's not your DS1.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.680
 It's not just like, if someone's listening to us going like,

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.880
 oh, it's distortion, I know what distortion is.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.440
 There's a drive and you turn that knob up.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.120
 - There is, it does have a drive knob.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.400
 - But that's not what is making this exceptional.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.400
 - What makes this exceptional is black magic.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.240
 (laughing)

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.320
 - Yeah.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.160
 - The fact that-- - Fear, satanic,

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:07.360
 ritualistic Cosmo juice has been injected into this box.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.520
 - Every one of those switches evokes a different demon.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.360
 - It does.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.200
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.280
 - They're hardwired to passages from the Necronomicon.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.880
 Beelzebub himself might reside in there.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.000
 Not sure.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.360
 - No, I, it's, I don't know what makes it sound so good.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.240
 I don't fucking know circuitry.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.080
 You know what I mean?

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.760
 If I was an engineer, I would probably splooge over

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.000
 what components are in this thing and you know,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.480
 what Terzo has been able to create.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.560
 I just know that it sounds like

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.800
 shit that is in my imagination.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.120
 - Just what you were explaining before we started recording.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.440
 I mean, you've got this sort of path that goes from

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.360
 filter to EQ.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.800
 - Oh, you want me to get into like the components of it?

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.840
 - Maybe not necessarily get into it because obviously

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.760
 if you do, I can see your eyes and your eyes.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.320
 (laughing)

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.600
 Like I don't, I don't think we have enough time

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.440
 for you to get everything.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.440
 - But like if you just go down the section of it.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.280
 - A little bit of a breakdown, yeah.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.680
 - It's, it goes from like left to right.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.480
 Like the first section is your preamp selection.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.200
 And then it has like where things are going.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.640
 You know, it's all like tucked there on the left-hand side.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.880
 Like is it going through the EQ, the compressor,

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.080
 the saturator?

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.400
 Next section is the filter, section after that is your EQ.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.200
 Then it goes to compressor and drive.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.440
 And then lastly always the right is your mixer.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:31.120
 So you can fine tune, you know, your dry or your EQ mix

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.960
 or your compressor and your saturation mix.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.720
 And it makes sense.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.520
 The way everything is laid out to me at least,

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.360
 you know what I mean?

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.880
 Like I, it has a manual.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.840
 I haven't looked at it.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.520
 I've just kind of been feeling it out since I've gotten it.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.240
 - It's one of those things where if somebody was like,

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.760
 "Oh, you can only have a computer to make music,

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.960
 but you can have this thing."

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.280
 I'd be like, "Okay."

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.880
 (laughing)

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.400
 - That was exactly my logic.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.240
 You know what I mean?

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:03.640
 Like I was like, if I had one big dick outboard processor unit,

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.480
 what would it be?

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.760
 And I spent a lot of time researching them.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.760
 I wanted onboard filtering compression with saturation.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.920
 There's a lot of shit out there that is one

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.800
 or the other or two and not all three.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.960
 This thing nailed it.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.480
 It had everything that I wanted in it.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.240
 And even like some of the other overstaired devices,

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.720
 you know, they're like known for being good at one thing,

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.680
 not necessarily having the functions of the other.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.840
 And you have to get like two units, you know what I mean?

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.240
 This was everything all in one.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.040
 So even though it was expensive and it's large,

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.600
 it's multiple devices in under one hood basically.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.600
 You know what I mean?

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.480
 - Stereo too.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.080
 - And it's stereo, yeah.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.440
 Yeah, it just hit like everything on my checklist

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.360
 that I was looking for.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.720
 So I decided I would go for this one over some

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.440
 of the other stuff that I was checking out originally.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.800
 - I mean, even before we started recording,

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.280
 we were talking about that thing of like,

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.000
 you were able to just shape the same input signal

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.200
 in a million different ways

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.200
 and just create completely different things.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.320
 - If you got the ear for it, you know what I mean?

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.160
 - Yeah, it's true.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.160
 - Some people would hear it and just be like,

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.440
 okay, that just sounds a little different.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.560
 Like distorted now, you know what I mean?

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.240
 Or if they don't know, it's changed at all.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.760
 You know, if you got the ear for dirt and grime

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.160
 and you like fucking shit up.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.000
 - Which audio bias?

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.320
 - All three of us do.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.160
 - Which we do, yeah.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160
 (laughing)

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.440
 - Yeah, it's like infinite sweet spots.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.280
 - Yeah.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.760
 - But the biggest selling point of all,

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.480
 Turdzo gives you the option of a black panel if you want.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.800
 - Which is fucking beautiful.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.840
 - Yeah, this is aesthetically astounding, yeah.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.720
 - Yeah, that was real happy when I found out

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.480
 I had the option to do that.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.280
 It was like an unspoken option too.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:49.400
 I just noticed somebody said it on a forum somewhere like,

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.240
 oh yeah, I was talking to Jeff about it,

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.960
 blah, blah, blah, and then he mentioned it,

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.360
 like I could get it in black.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.640
 And I was just like, holy shit.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.800
 So when I ordered one, I was just like,

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.720
 by the way, is it possible to get this in black?

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.080
 And the, I forget her name,

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.000
 but she was like, the sales rep basically.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.120
 She was like, oh yeah, you can get a black panel for it.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.560
 And I was like, sold, matches everything else.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.560
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:15.720
 But yeah, it's like three different saturation circuits,

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.560
 I guess you could say.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.680
 But at the same time, you can also achieve saturation

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.680
 through just the compressor or through the preamps

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.440
 or through the EQ.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.200
 So there's so many different ways to achieve saturation

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.840
 and I've yet to find a way that sounds bad,

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.200
 if that makes any sense.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.840
 It doesn't sound like you're pushing a cheap component

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:40.680
 to the point where it's breaking down type of clipping.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:45.080
 It all sounds like you're filling up the space of like,

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.360
 that's just begging to be filled.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.200
 Do you know what I mean?

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.080
 I don't know, like everything sounds like it can handle

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.080
 you pushing it to the max if you want.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:56.000
 I feel weird talking about it

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.960
 'cause I feel like it's like a secret weapon type of thing.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.800
 You know what I mean?

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.800
 But at the same time,

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.760
 I just like coming up with weird ways to distort stuff.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.840
 And I don't necessarily enjoy sharing those processes.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.680
 You know what I mean?

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.000
 It's like it becomes your own, you know,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.240
 once you discover it.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.520
 This thing almost feels like cheating to me.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.360
 You know what I mean?

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.280
 In some ways, just like,

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.720
 I've come up with so many methods over the years

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.320
 of like creating complex distortion chains, you know?

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.920
 And this thing, I can dial that in with a few knob twists,

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:28.120
 you know, the type of sound that I've spent fucking years

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.600
 trying to develop or think up, you know, or sound.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.680
 You're dumping through like a million hoops to get to it.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.920
 And so now it feels like this is too easy.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.200
 It's very rewarding.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.760
 Yeah, I know.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.960
 I'm a mass kiss though.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.520
 I feel like if I'm not struggling,

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.600
 then I'm not doing it right, you know?

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.440
 So even with all the methods that I come up with

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.520
 to fuck shit up, a lot of it doesn't hit

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.960
 where my imagination is.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.640
 You know, this thing gets me closer

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.640
 than any single device ever has.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.240
 I'll say that much.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:03.080
 So yeah, props to Turdo for tapping into my mind somehow

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:07.960
 and making it manifest itself as a single box

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.480
 that now sits on my desk.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.640
 - And luckily in some ways like that's a,

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.680
 it's a pretty steep barrier to entry there.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.440
 Nobody's gonna get one of those on a whim.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.040
 - Exactly.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.160
 - Like it's not a pedal.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.320
 - I might shit talk like the analog heat, you know what I mean?

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.640
 But at the same time that box probably does exactly

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.360
 what a lot of people need.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.200
 - Yeah, sure.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:33.200
 - This would probably be insanely overkill for most people.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.920
 In fact, as I sat there and tweaked it,

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.200
 I'm sitting there wondering like,

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.360
 who the fuck else wants this?

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.200
 You know what I mean?

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.400
 It's like weird, it was like me.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.680
 Like I'm surprised that Turdo made something

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.920
 that can get so extreme.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.080
 - It's like you in Tarmred, that's it.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.080
 - Yeah.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.160
 - Yeah.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.520
 In fact, like yeah, like I've stumbled across

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.520
 like Tarmred type timbers on this thing.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.360
 You know what I mean?

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.200
 And I've thought that to myself like,

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.400
 you know, he would probably love this thing.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.200
 I think it's the filters before the saturation circuit

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.720
 that comes across that.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.640
 Like Tarmred has always had that like squeegee filter,

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.480
 you know, pre saturation sound going on,

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.440
 which I've always loved.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.280
 Yeah.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.800
 The filters are MS20 based and they just,

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.000
 they can really scream if you want them to.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.040
 - Well, unfortunately now the, your secret's out.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.040
 - Cats out the bag.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.680
 - Cats out the bag.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.880
 Well, I'm not the first person to have one.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.520
 I'm pretty sure Richard Devine has one

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.160
 and he's shown it off if I recall.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.480
 - He also has a drum sequencer with the black keys.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.280
 - Yeah, I don't know how the fuck he got black keys.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.520
 Mine does not have black keys

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.920
 and I did not see an option at black keys, but.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.840
 - Well, sorry we made you talk about this.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.840
 - Yeah.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.440
 - Do you feel better like getting off your chest?

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.520
 - A little, a little.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.280
 - Do you want to go to pizza?

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:56.720
 - To the entity receiving this message,

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:01.360
 you have been granted temporary access to the pizza realm

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:06.160
 ending any outstanding credits.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:10.960
 Please make your topping choices known.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.360
 (soft music)

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.040
 - It's squat before entering.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:19.720
 We won't tolerate much here.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.140
 (soft music)

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.560
 (soft music)

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.980
 (soft music)

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.400
 (soft music)

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.140
 (dramatic music)

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.380
 (whoosh)
