 What happened?

 Who is it?

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.940
 Fucking Hans.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.940
 Yeah.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.940
 Hans Zimmer.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.940
 Yeah.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.940
 So how are they doing it this late?

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 Isn't it coming out like--

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.940
 That's what everyone wants to know.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.940
 Yeah.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.940
 You got Zimmer.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 Hey, god Zimmer.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.940
 Yeah, Zimmer's going to crank it out overnight, I guess.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.940
 Wow.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.940
 Yeah.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.220
 I mean, originally Zimmer wasn't involved, but he was like second name, you know, and some

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.940
 other guy who I'm not familiar with.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.940
 So he's been the alternate all along?

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.940
 I mean, is that how this works?

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.940
 Well, no, he wasn't like the alternate.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.940
 He was just like assisting.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.940
 Gotcha.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.940
 You know, I guess kind of like the Tron soundtrack.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.940
 Like that was primarily Death Punk assisted by the Zimmer man.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 Yeah.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.940
 He added some funick strings behind the--

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.940
 Right.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.940
 --the Death Punk stuff.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 Yeah, so I don't know.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.940
 Maybe he was doing something like that.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.940
 But yet now it's all him.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.940
 It wasn't the big reveal after the Dark Knight that he just uses Zebra.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.940
 He has all that crazy ass gear, and he basically just uses Zebra.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.940
 He used Zebra a lot, like he revealed it in those videos, but he also uses some real string

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.940
 player.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.940
 Oh, okay.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.940
 Because they showed him in some of the behind the scenes stuff, like going to town on strings.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 He himself?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.940
 Like he's playing--

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.940
 No.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.340
 This dude that he works with, he was doing all the crazy string stuff, and then I guess Hans

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 was just kind of using that along with some stuff and Zebra.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 But it's that weird thing, like the picture of the studio and that studio is just like

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.340
 insane.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.340
 Like it just-- it looks like a fake painting.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.340
 Yeah.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.540
 Like it's like this like perfectly ideal Victorian studio, and then it's like-- and it's just him

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.340
 squatting over a computer using Zebra.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.340
 Yeah.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.340
 You want to see him use the fucking wall of modular stuff?

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.340
 Yeah, exactly.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.340
 Yeah, yeah.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.340
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.340
 I don't have a problem with Hans, but I do have a problem with the fact that it's going

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.340
 to be last minute now and rushed.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.340
 Remember that first time he did that soundtrack?

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.340
 And then he did the same thing for everyone after?

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.340
 Yes.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.340
 I feel like there's just like-- it just sounds like him.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.340
 It's like him.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.340
 The Dark Knight.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.340
 Yeah.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.340
 I don't--

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.340
 Yeah, there's just not a lot of variety in what he does, but I'm just a little disappointed

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.340
 that this is now going to sound like every other movie made over last time.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.340
 Yeah, a string sound.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.340
 Epic--

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.340
 Yeah, Epic Swell.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.340
 Or Sound of a ticking clock.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.340
 It's an anxious moment.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.580
 It's tense.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.580
 You can hear a clock ticking for the last 10 minutes in the background of the soundtrack.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.580
 Time is important.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.580
 He did it again.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.580
 And Dunkirk.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.580
 Yeah.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.580
 Yeah.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.580
 Like halfway through the movie, it might even have been like through the whole movie.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.580
 I don't know because my brain just started to like block it out, but there's like that constant

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.580
 ticking in the sound.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.580
 It sounds like a stopwatch.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.580
 Yeah.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.580
 And a constant single string note going in the background.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.580
 Yeah.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.580
 Yeah.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.580
 For tension.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.580
 You know?

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.580
 It's like--

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.580
 Yeah, I get it.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.580
 Yeah.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.580
 And it's building.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.580
 Yeah.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.580
 He should have to only use a CS80 to do whatever he does.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.580
 Or a Deckard stream or a CS80.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.580
 Deckard stream seems really appropriate.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.580
 Yeah.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.580
 I mean, that would be.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.580
 That was it, no, I'm coming.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.580
 That wasn't.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.580
 No.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.580
 We didn't play it.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.580
 I don't know why.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.580
 I was just like, yeah, I don't even want to like it.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.580
 It scares me.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.580
 You know?

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.580
 But it's a kit.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.580
 Yeah.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.580
 You can build it as a kit too.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.580
 And it's for everything but the enclosure I saw, it's like 350 bucks.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.580
 All the slide.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.580
 You still got the enclosures like no joke.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.580
 But you can buy that from some other company.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.580
 And then it's like 1100 bucks built, which is like a 30th of the price of what a CS80

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.580
 would be, I think.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.580
 Yeah.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.580
 They're like 30 grand or something.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.580
 Yeah.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.580
 I mean, when they pop up.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.580
 Yeah.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.580
 When you can get one, that would work maybe.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.580
 I ended up playing with pretty much everything I walked past except for the world of romplers.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.580
 Yeah.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.580
 Yeah.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.580
 And that was one, I did the same thing.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.580
 I'm like, yeah, that's cool.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.580
 Yeah.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.580
 I'm fine with not falling in love with it.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.580
 The only thing I'd want to do with the CS80 is just make the Blade Runner just sound strange.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.580
 That's kind of what they were doing in the trailer already.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.580
 I'm pretty sure that was Johan's work.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.580
 Because it sounded very much like the evangelist score but it was like, you know, that's weak.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.580
 And I'm like, okay, if this is how all the soundtracks are going to be from movie, I'm totally fucking into that.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.580
 But then I don't know if it's going to be all strings now, like we're saying as well.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.580
 I don't know.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.580
 Like, why did they get rid of Johan?

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.580
 You know what I mean?

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.580
 Good question.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.580
 His people released no info, said they can't do it in the days.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.580
 So it's like, what the fuck happened?

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.580
 I mean, I've not heard of that guy as like an asshole.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.580
 I mean, I don't follow him closely but like it's not like he's a notoriously hard person to work with or anything.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.580
 Dude, it seemed like everyone was excited that he was involved.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.580
 Yeah.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.580
 Because I feel like every fan of Blade Runner had that concern initially.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.580
 Like, okay, all movie concerns aside, how's the sound going to be?

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.580
 You know what I mean?

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.580
 Like, what's the soundtrack going to be like?

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.580
 And when they announced him and then the trailer came out and it sounded excellent.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.580
 It was like, okay.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.580
 I can roll with this and now he's just like last minute kicked out.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.580
 So, what the fuck?

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.580
 I guess I'm not going to follow up on.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.580
 Like, we did the knock on hype.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.580
 Now what about the follow up criticisms?

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.580
 I'd like to give a little, I want to say shout out because that's what like people work say now.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.580
 So that means it's over.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.580
 Mmm.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.580
 That's dead.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.580
 What's in the accolades?

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.580
 Let's just go with the classics.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.580
 Not kudos.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.580
 Not kudos.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.580
 No, not like kudos.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.580
 Yeah.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.580
 Wasn't that a candy bar?

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.580
 Yeah.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.580
 It was a candy bar for a while.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.580
 Big ups.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.580
 Yeah, big ups.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.580
 Okay, let's go big ups.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.580
 Props.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.580
 Props are big ups.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.580
 Listeners, you choose.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.580
 Synth Cube.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:32.580
 They ran the ornament and crime build workshop and the dude Raph ran it fucking astounding.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.580
 I cannot recommend anyone who's interested in like doing DIY stuff, basically all skill

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.580
 levels.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.580
 Had a lot of SMT parts, showed everyone how to do it.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.020
 People obviously had in the group and maybe not necessarily done a lot of stuff or any

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.020
 at all.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.380
 I now have a working ornament and crime.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.820
 It was overall a positive experience except for this is not their fault.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.580
 One of the people in the group was a colossal asshole.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.380
 Oh yeah, that fucking dude.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.380
 So it's sort of at the beginning and it's the bottom floor of knob.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.480
 Like the hotel and they'd move the bug out room to right beside it, which made perfect

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.580
 sense because it was like, you know, it's out of the way.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.580
 They could, you know, roll out.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.580
 Exactly.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.580
 So they're sound checking.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.580
 It was like early in the morning on Sunday and then they're sound checking because they

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.180
 were going to start at one and you could hear it.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.940
 It wasn't outrageously loud, but it was like, oh, you can hear something going on, but like

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.580
 you could still hear people talking in this room.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.340
 This dude beside me is like getting agitated and like every time the sound would come

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.100
 on and he would, oh, what is this?

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.100
 What is this?

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.300
 The whole time I'm thinking, you're going to fucking synthesize your convention.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.980
 Like you're going to hear sounds.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.780
 No one promised perfect, peace and quiet.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.660
 You came to the wrong fucking place.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.620
 If you go up into the main room, it's just buzzing and weird sounds and commotion.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.180
 It's going back and forth for about a half an hour.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.980
 Like he's not really working on it because every time like the sound would come on,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.660
 like he'd put everything down and go like exasperated like, oh, I can't work in these

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.660
 conditions.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.940
 Like he's a fucking pro golfer.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:08.700
 So he like, so one point he stands up and just storms out and like, like, you know, that's

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.300
 sort of like three, two, one, the sound in the next room goes out.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.900
 I'm like, are you fucking, did he seriously?

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.060
 And sure enough comes back in proud as a fucking peacock.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.460
 Like his chest all puffed up.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:25.140
 He's like, I won't, I will not be made a full of and sits back down just so fucking proud

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.140
 of himself.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.140
 Like he showed those kids.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.740
 So thankfully a little one made a louder dude.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.940
 I've been like, oh, fuck.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.380
 So I had to leave early was supposed to be a 10 noon and then it was going to be a break

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.900
 and then from one to two would be the second half.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.940
 But Eric, the dude who ran the bug out room, super cool guy, asked me in Nick if we wanted

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.860
 to play in the bug out room at one.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.860
 It's like, cool.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.900
 I wasn't really what I didn't really want to stay for the workshop the whole time.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.260
 It was like, cool.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:57.380
 So like I went back, got my stuff, pack up and I go over to the bug out room about one

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:03.540
 o'clock starts and a little bit after that we started playing and even we started playing

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.340
 I'm like, oh shit, that workshop just started up.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.580
 I bet that dude's just sitting over there.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.420
 I'm like, it but it's gonna come yell at me about how long into us playing.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.380
 Did he show up 15 minutes about 15 minutes into it and I look over and it's him.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.860
 His fucking chest is all puffed up.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.540
 Just walks over like right in front of everything like like right where we're playing.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.100
 Do you do you hear what he actually said?

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.260
 I mean, I know he was yelling because he just had the look of like just an like an angry

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.420
 old dude yelling at people to get off his lawn.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.300
 All I heard was Mike, the guy that we were playing with at one point looks over.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.500
 He's like, oh that dude wants us to turn it down.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.340
 So I started to turn it up.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.340
 He's still there.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:45.420
 Instead to stare at him while we turn the bass up more and it's like more and more sound

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.220
 and of course he wouldn't like look over and I just wanted him to because it was early

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.980
 and I was fucking ordinary at the time.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.700
 So like this dude's like, you know, a synth convention dude.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.780
 This is like the room that has big speakers that's dedicated to making sound like yeah,

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.940
 put some fucking headphones on man, do something like you're the only fucking person complaining

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.260
 on this whole thing.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.020
 Maybe whole fucking hotel.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.180
 You have one jack up.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.300
 Things he speaks for everyone.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.620
 It's just like I couldn't possibly be the only one that has a problem with this.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.860
 No, but he did leave and we didn't turn down.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.180
 No, no, we didn't turn down.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.180
 Turned down for what?

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.100
 That was the only that was the only downside of that entire workshop, which again, not

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.100
 since cubes fall.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.100
 Always takes.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.580
 There's always gotta be one, you know.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.580
 Or other highlights.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.820
 I'm trying to think.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.460
 Oh, the noise engineering booth.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.460
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:39.540
 The man is Sateratos, which was as they self described at nine inch nails in a module,

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.740
 which sounds pretty good.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:47.340
 Nastier bass, it's like all sawtooth wave based in a few different modes, like a little filter

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.340
 onto it.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.420
 It seemed more like kind of a mini synth voice.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:56.020
 Yeah, kind of like bass, but had the thinking how to low pass filter on it or some shit

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.020
 too.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.020
 It sounded good.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:04.420
 All the rest of the Roland boutique synths were there and we got to play with those.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:09.860
 Yeah, the D05 was the big surprise at that point because they debuted the D50 clone,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:15.020
 which is just like, you know, that's in I think 80s synth.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.020
 Yeah, the D50.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.020
 L.A.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.020
 Synthesis or whatever.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.460
 It sounded like it can be very fucking cheesy.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.460
 Yeah.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.700
 Forward sounds or like swirly pad stuff.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.500
 What's holding the gimmicky little joystick?

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.740
 Yeah, it did seem like the, they had the studio, studio electronics one, which sounded really

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.780
 good, but the knobs on it were like fucking garbage.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.500
 Really felt like super flimsy and small.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.260
 The 101 sounded, that was the like definitely the best built.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.380
 It's a little cramped, but it sounded really good.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.260
 I got to say though, go back to the SE02.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.020
 I had all the demos online just made it seem like real like bread and butter, like not

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.020
 that exciting.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.340
 It's a SE02 supposed to be.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.780
 It's studio electronics was like here is the circuit.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.500
 It's kind of a mini Moog clone.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.500
 That's what I thought.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.500
 Okay, because it looked like one.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.500
 Here you go.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.500
 Put it in your box roll.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.500
 Okay.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.980
 They did all the circuitry and were like convert this design over to surface.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.780
 Why is Roland making a Moog clone though?

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.780
 Good question.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:16.540
 I mean, it sounded like, like what a weird, it's a strange collab.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.540
 Yeah.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.540
 You know, like.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.540
 But it sounded, it sounded way better than that.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.020
 I mean, definitely not up my alley.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.020
 Like I'm not tempted to get it.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.020
 I get coupled demos of it.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.740
 It did sound nice, but again, I'm not into Moog sounds.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:31.180
 But based on the videos I saw, which made it just sound incredibly boring, playing with

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.700
 it live, it had a lot more teeth and thought it was going to happen.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.620
 It has cross mod too between the oscillators, which I don't think you can do on a Moog.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.540
 I'm not really familiar with Moog's either.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.660
 I've never really had one or used one much.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.460
 I think it just sort of mentioned it just in the fact that it was surprisingly sounding

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.460
 better than it was.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.460
 Yeah, it's cheapest of luck, right?

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.460
 Not the very day the Moog clone.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.460
 Totally.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.460
 Yeah, way cheap.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.940
 And they're good circuit design.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.780
 So they'll sell millions of these things.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.780
 I would think so.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.540
 I don't know, because it's not, it's the least sexy of the ones that they put out.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.340
 Like it's just very.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.340
 But it's Moog.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.340
 Everyone likes that sound.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.340
 But the demos are really bland.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.340
 Yeah.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.780
 They're not doing themselves any favor with these demos they put out.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:15.300
 But even the D50, it's like the same shitty kind of button editing of the old one.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.540
 Like they didn't really make it any better.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.820
 So I guess if you want that sound, it's like I saw people on muffler a little bit.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.620
 We're like, oh, this is the one I've been waiting for or something, which is like,

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.380
 well, I don't understand you at all.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.260
 But that's cool if you want that.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.780
 Lego well made the demo like they got him to make a video of it.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.420
 And because he likes that and he can probably patch it really well and make that electro

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.340
 kind of stuff like old school 80s throwback stuff.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:44.020
 So I could see it in that light, but that's not, I don't think what any of us are going

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.020
 for.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.700
 And I had one SHO one because I went to the Roland guy who, it was cool to talk to him.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.180
 I talked to the guy who led the team who leads the team that makes the boutiques like super

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.620
 polite Japanese dude was awesome to talk to.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.540
 And he's like, no, we don't have any here.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.020
 There's one over at Synth City, which is like what Fox tones used companies called now.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.020
 Okay.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.020
 Same people basically.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.260
 And they were like, yeah, we had one and it was gone four minutes, five minutes like

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.860
 sold and bought like, ah, okay.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.860
 Damn.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.100
 Cause I think the way they said it was like, Oh, we were leaving to pack up for this.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.820
 And there was a Roland box in the hallway.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.420
 We were like, Oh, what's this?

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.540
 And they just pulled like an 808 and an SH one out and left and kind of brought it to

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.540
 knob con.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.980
 So I'm honestly surprised that they didn't make this a two O two.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.500
 Yeah, because they're going with small form factor.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.180
 The two O two was already a small form factor one at one without keys.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.380
 So like, why not just reproduce the two O two?

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.380
 That's a good question.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.380
 Yeah.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.860
 Maybe the one at one is a little bit more notorious.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.020
 Yeah, that's a people know what that is.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.340
 Even if not a synth nerd.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.340
 True.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.340
 That is true, dude.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.060
 Cause even a few years ago, you could get a two O two on eBay cheapest fuck.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.060
 Yeah.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.060
 Nobody knew what the fuck it was.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:57.180
 Like until I think like a faxed one mentioned like that he loves his two O two and then all

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.900
 of a sudden everyone was like, Oh, shit, that's just like a small one on one.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.900
 It's like, yeah, no shit.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.700
 And boy to Canada.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.700
 Yeah.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.220
 Cause I remember when I when I went on one shit itself, I was like, well, maybe I'll just

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.500
 get a two O two and I should have fucking jumped on it, dude, because they were so cheap

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.500
 on eBay at that time.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.220
 It was like, well, you're fighting.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:32.900
 I know you're doing some visual stuff.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.660
 The other thing was the the erogenous tones structure module.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.660
 Yeah.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.420
 And I was like, oh, I'm blowing the hell's that?

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.820
 You could load like 3D models onto it that you could project with the module.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:50.580
 You can control them with CV or audio and you could load like custom shader code for

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.860
 the 3D models.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.820
 And that's like the shaders that would apply to those meshes or whatever objects you're

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.820
 loading in there.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:03.500
 And it had a little PlayStation controller joystick on it and you could map anything to

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.500
 that.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.700
 And it was like the movement of the joystick and it was he had like a simple feedback patch

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.820
 and then was playing back some stuff and it was like some of the best video shit either

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.740
 of us were standing there like jaws.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.900
 And it's just one module.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:23.020
 This could be the first and potentially only thing you needed to hook video stuff up to

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.020
 your modular rack.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.020
 The main mecca.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.020
 Yeah.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.020
 Oh, right.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.260
 That sounds like something that would be a good partner with it.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.260
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.660
 Getting like a two channel video mixer and mixed between the two type of thing.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.100
 You didn't get an ETA or at least aid from it, but it was not crude.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.980
 I think it might be pretty soon.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.860
 We both saw it and we're like, oh, Nate cake would like shit his pants over this basically.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.860
 Yeah.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:49.540
 It was like loading these models and twist them like it seemed like he would go nuts

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.540
 on it just based on the stuff that he makes.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.540
 Cool.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.180
 Seemed like all the video stuff was next level and even the Saturday night stuff where

00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.660
 they had people playing music the best part by far was the video synth stuff that was going

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.660
 along with it.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.540
 Dude had an LCX system and they had like multiple feedback loops going with different monitors

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.540
 and shit and it was awesome.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.540
 Nice.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.540
 Like it was really good.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.300
 It was also the the Paul Shriver experience.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.300
 Yeah.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.300
 Yeah.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:20.540
 Noob con annual festivity of talking to Paul about whatever he's cooking up the 352 and

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:27.380
 the E370 which are his new oscillators the 352 is pretty much the king of wave table

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.940
 oscillators right now as far as like single voice wave table with a bunch of it's an extension

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:38.180
 of his 350 morphing terrarium and the cloud generator which was the 340.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:44.260
 So it's both of those plus a bunch of stuff to op FM application to load your own wave

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.500
 tables via SD card and the editor is unreal editor.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.500
 Yeah.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.500
 Yeah.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.820
 It's 16 bit stuff instead of eight bit now like the old stuff was and just amazing and

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.620
 then the 370 which is the four voice version of that which is more limited from control

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.580
 standpoint you only get two controls for each voice but you can assign them to a bunch

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:09.340
 of stuff and that does through zero FM and a sampler which just got even more when somebody

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.340
 on.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.340
 So it's not a secret anymore.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.340
 Yeah.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.340
 Not really.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.340
 Okay.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.700
 He had it on there so it can be a sampler in each one of those four channels on the big

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.300
 one.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:25.420
 The guy that made that VCV that open source modular synth program made the editor.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.460
 That was mind blowing shit.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.460
 Sounds amazing.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.460
 I love it.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.460
 You have one.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.460
 I have one.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.980
 We've both had them since not coming.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:39.500
 I squeezed mine in two nights before I had that show.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.700
 It was not hard for me to figure out a way to use it live.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.620
 I was nervous about slapping something into my rig so last minute you know I mean because

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.580
 there's definitely things I don't know about that model yet and I was like I'm going to

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.580
 fuck something up.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.980
 It's not surprising though because even when you took yours back to the hotel room after

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.020
 you picked it up within minutes you're making shit.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.540
 Like there's a lot of deep stuff in it.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.580
 But you were minutes away from just making awesome sounds.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.140
 Yeah it's so straightforward and he's got like a little manual in there.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.660
 There's an about screen if you're going to use it out of the controls like he really

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.580
 thought like alright let's just make this so you can pick this thing up and use it in

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.460
 a few minutes for as deep as it is.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.540
 Like he kicked ass on that one.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.820
 Yeah the screen's actually it serves a purpose other than eye candy.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.820
 Yeah.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.020
 It's very useful to the interface and to just like figuring shit out.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.020
 Totally.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.540
 Like I spent an hour with it and I felt like I wrapped my head around every option within

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.540
 it.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.860
 You know within it I was even changing the colors of shit on it already and you know

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.540
 I was like yeah I was like this thing sweet.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.900
 It made me want the 370.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.900
 Yeah.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.900
 I'm like this is one voice.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.180
 You know and it's that powerful and has that much potential like I can't imagine a module

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.100
 that has four of those embedded in it with more options.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.420
 Yeah there is one bummer about the 370.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.420
 What's that?

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.420
 It's crazy fucking expensive.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.420
 Yeah.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:01.300
 Especially now after the promo is over it's like $400 more or like $1400 I think it was

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.300
 going to be.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.300
 Yeah.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.780
 And he had it there for like $950 or something like that.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.820
 It's not cheap but it's like you get a ton of stuff.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.260
 I mean that could be your oscillator.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.340
 I was just saying it's one of those modules where like you wouldn't need another one to

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.340
 oscillator.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.940
 Like I think a lot of people build systems around like a voice and I feel like this is

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.380
 the first one that would satisfy me.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.740
 I mean just with the 352 alone I'm having a blast with it and I can easily see having

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.340
 another one paired with it.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.020
 It's the only oscillator in my live rig right now.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.180
 As soon as I got it I kind of redid the rig.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.180
 I want them on.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.180
 I don't know.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.420
 I have the syncatur in there also but.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.420
 Gotcha.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.980
 Just for like some extra help.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:46.300
 Yeah it was my main oscillator driving the show.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.940
 And it fms really well too.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.740
 You can really nail it with really high frequency fm and it doesn't break up like some digital

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.380
 modules well it's really really clean.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.980
 I think it's all 24 96 internally or something like that.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.540
 Yeah it sounds as loud as fuck.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.540
 Yeah it really does.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.540
 Very.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.780
 I mean in all honesty Paul's kicking ass right now.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.140
 You can tell I mean that is why braids was discontinued is that module right there.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.460
 Yeah period he even came out and put his post on there which was kind of sad Olivier

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:18.180
 and it's like there are people out there doing it better and I didn't realize that braids

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.300
 is like very close to the price of that actually it's not far.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.140
 Yeah braids new is 399.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:29.380
 Yeah and that's for 50 or 469 now that's like no brainer you're going to get the 352

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.180
 if you know you know no question.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.660
 I agree.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.740
 So I literally pulled my braids out of my live rig the night that I caught that I was

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.620
 like this this thing's going in.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.220
 Yep I rearranged it to fit it because it's obviously bigger than a braids but.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.780
 But it's laid out really nicely it's not cramped.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:51.860
 It's really nice to use live it's got CV attenuators on all the inputs which the 350

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.300
 and 340 never had which people would complain about all the time and he was always like I

00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:00.100
 just use attenuators so he even didn't listen to people his first designs didn't have those

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.700
 in and he put them in which is pretty cool.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:09.380
 I saw that you could pick any wave you know standard wave shape I'm like cool and then

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:14.660
 got into like all the the more crazy yeah the morphing wave shape I was like this is amazing

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.580
 like this is this is next level shit.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.380
 That into the rain maker and it's just some lovely shit.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.020
 I haven't even fucked with like the FM or anything.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.380
 I haven't too much either.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.780
 It'd be really hard to get something better than that.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.500
 It's going to be hard when it's off.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.500
 You just read the more.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.900
 Yeah and let's see you raise this is our part.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.140
 53 is going to be pretty good.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:41.500
 It was his other thing he's making another bigger module and he's like it's going to

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.180
 be a conglomeration of stuff I've already made.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.180
 That was the one.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:50.460
 I'm going to make another big one and he's also going to make the CS 80 filter which he

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:56.060
 had an MOTM format forever and there's a Euro one coming out that's like that kind of

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:01.460
 size I think no screen but just a lot of controls and I think that's like I don't know

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:06.220
 I don't know about the CS 80 filter I don't know much about it but it has those capabilities

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.220
 whatever they are.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.860
 Not super familiar.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:14.500
 Not many other big crops for offering the panel in black.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.660
 Yeah and now he's like oh it'll always be available in black.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.660
 That is awesome.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.260
 Yeah it's so nice especially with the screen with black.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:29.140
 It's a nice contrast yeah super pleasing and the editors fucking amazing.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.780
 You can make the stuff you can do with waveforms in there you can't do with most other programs.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.420
 I haven't fucked with it or yet.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:39.540
 You can do like wave folding of any other waveforms you put in there just select by frequency

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:44.140
 band and you can map like straight up sample in one of the banks and it'll just like traverse

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.380
 it and play it like a sample back.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.180
 It's pretty sweet.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.340
 What kind of control do you have?

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.900
 Are we talking like you can do granular stuff with it?

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.380
 I think well you can do.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.060
 It's just playing a straight wave file and you can pitch it.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.420
 It's just anything you can do with any of the morphing realms I think it just kind of treats

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.060
 it as one of those and you just do it so it scans it.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.100
 Can you make a cloud out of a sample?

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.100
 I don't know.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.100
 I think so.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.980
 I don't see why you couldn't just raise his questions.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:16.100
 There's a lot to feel like I'm just scratching that thing the surface of it.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.540
 Yeah we thought we took it back to the hotel room and we thought we found a bug and how

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:24.060
 the CV input's working he was just shaking his head like no no no.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.060
 This is how it works.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.180
 Okay I didn't fucking know.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.340
 Here's a C6 dumpster can cooze.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.860
 Let me throw it in the pile.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.380
 That was like oh yeah.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.740
 Great great human being.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.260
 I'm actually really curious about the filter.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.900
 He makes that discreet filter.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.420
 The three I don't know.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.420
 Whichever one it is.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.060
 It was like the famous MOTM form.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.060
 Right.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.060
 I'd like to try it.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:51.180
 It's supposed to sound really good but I got to crack into that ornament and crime.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.660
 Oh that's just fun.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:58.100
 I've spent an embarrassing amount of time just staring at that OLED like fuck.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.180
 That's cool man.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.140
 Yeah are you even listening to it right now?

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.140
 I'm just looking.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.140
 I'm just experiencing it man.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.500
 Just like the less age just waves.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:12.620
 The four outputs of the ornament crime going into the 352 and looking at the 3D waveform

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.620
 view on there.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.420
 That's like yeah I'm gonna lose some time with that.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.620
 I've been practicing a lot for our lives yet and I've got coming up and I'm starting

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:27.060
 to learn associate the visual in the 352 with what I'm trying to get back to them.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.980
 Oh I know this waveform is like it looks like this and you can say presets in the 352

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.980
 which is awesome.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.060
 You get like eight of them or ten.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.460
 So that's been super helpful for me and I just visually know like oh this is modulating

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.460
 this.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.660
 I got to turn these modulations down to get it to look like this again.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.180
 I keep thinking like the one thing I could use is a switch but then I keep going back

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.980
 to like I'd love a system of switches where I could just like turn this setting and it

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.340
 would be like boom now you're going here now this bolt proctor signals go into this

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.580
 module instead of this one.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.740
 Almost like a like a routing board.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.740
 Exactly.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.940
 Yeah I don't know what that doesn't exist but that's still like how do I manage that

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.940
 stuff live and how can I be faster with it.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.940
 Right.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.140
 That's when it leads me to like maybe you need some switches or something.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.700
 Yeah like set that shit up.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.300
 What's that synth that has like the peg board?

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.300
 Oh the.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.900
 Routing with just pegs of something.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.860
 Yeah but something along those lines of just having that matrix of routing options right

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.660
 there and then just plugging in like a telephone switchboard.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.180
 Yeah if you could do that and then just hit like save and then save your preset and then

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.060
 pull that shit out and start it again.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.060
 That would be.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.940
 You guys kind of describing the matrix group.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:34.940
 You're right.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.940
 You're right.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.940
 Kind of aren't we.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.140
 Clearly we all need matrix.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.140
 Yes.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.020
 I think Hinton might make that switch matrix too.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.860
 Or a must have a crazy matrix.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:46.860
 Yeah.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.820
 DCA matrix maybe that was it.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.820
 What else?

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.980
 Yeah electron drive.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:51.980
 Yeah yeah.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.260
 I can discuss that for a second.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.260
 And a digitact.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.260
 You got two of them.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.260
 Two of them.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.820
 I have two things I can bitch about.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:00.980
 You know what though?

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:01.980
 You don't have an electron keychain.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.980
 You do.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:07.180
 We have we got an electron keychains because a f*** and knob gun made a booth.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.180
 Ahh.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.180
 They're metal.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.180
 They're real f***ing nice.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.180
 You know what?

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.180
 Yeah they're pretty sweet.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.180
 You're really missed.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.700
 I'm a little jelly now.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.700
 That's what you should be.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.060
 Yeah it was nice to talk to the electron dude.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.260
 Yeah super cool.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.260
 What did they have there?

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.900
 Did you guys get the f*** with the heat?

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.900
 Digitact.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:24.900
 Heat.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.900
 Drive.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.340
 Is that f***ing with my drive?

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.980
 I'm still curious about the heat.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.140
 He said that when he was leaving he was like all the octatracts were just like on their

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.140
 way.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.540
 The octatract mark twos.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.540
 And then he said the...

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.580
 Oh you have news about that by the way.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.180
 Yeah they're trig conditions.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:44.060
 Which is funny because even Devin even though he does more distributor stuff he was like

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.380
 oh no the codes which is what he told me in Detroit last year he was like the codes

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.500
 full there's no room but they apparently found some room to put trigger conditions

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.620
 on the micro timing screen which would be fine like go into micro timing and set it

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:00.620
 up like that you know like we were saying that adds a lot to the octatract.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.620
 That adds a lot.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.620
 Especially because you can...

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.460
 That's recording triggers too the way the octatract works and it was immediately like

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.460
 f***.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.460
 Yeah.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.300
 I'm just like a few years as soon as I buy a digi-tack because I ruled out the mark two

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.300
 octa.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.300
 That's what I thought about it immediately.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.300
 Yeah I was like God f***ing...

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.940
 I heard that and was like Greg's gonna beat this.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:18.940
 Yeah.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.820
 As soon as you told me I just shook my head.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.820
 Really?

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:22.820
 Like for real?

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.500
 Was it like the night you got that to the tack?

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.500
 The same night.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.500
 Yeah.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.580
 Yeah well for the price I'm still happy with the digi.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.540
 Because the mark two octa is gonna be at least double the cost of a digi.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.980
 And right now I'm kinda happy with the digi.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:43.660
 Everything that I've bitched about in previous episodes, specs wise about the digi and why

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.580
 I was on the fence of buying one, I still stick to.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.580
 Okay.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.580
 Fair enough.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.500
 Like everything that I thought would bother me about it is.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.700
 Multiple outs bugs me.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.260
 Like the lack of multi outs is pissing me off.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.620
 What I have been doing is trying to split stuff off.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.620
 Left right.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.540
 Just basically get to channel.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.540
 Yeah.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:09.300
 Which is pain he asks and I shouldn't have to do in 2017 with a fucking sample.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.860
 I mean if you look at that though, I mean the back of the board is pretty filled in.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.860
 It is.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.860
 It's relatively small.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.300
 And I would have been cool with it being slightly bigger if it would have had multiple

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.300
 outs.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:25.900
 Yeah even do the VGA connector like DB25 or whatever and do like make me buy a cable to

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.900
 have eight outs.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.900
 That's fine but like.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.900
 Poor just have one input.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.900
 I don't understand why there's two inputs.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:31.900
 Yeah.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.900
 That can all record.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.900
 I'm like what?

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.900
 Yeah.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.260
 I just still there and I'm like am I missing something like why is there two input like

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.980
 I still don't understand it.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:44.020
 Even using assignable mono out would have been great.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.020
 Yeah compared to like the like you said the two inputs like thanks for mixing that for

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.020
 me.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.700
 I don't really fucking need that.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.660
 But I do like the size about it.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.220
 I feel like that's a good pro.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.220
 Yeah.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.820
 It's so fucking tiny because my desk is getting filled.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:03.900
 But OS complaints first off the filter.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.540
 It doesn't even have a band pass and you can only have low pass or high pass.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.140
 I'm like you can't have both.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.620
 You can't squeeze a band pass in there.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.620
 That frustrates me.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.620
 No EQ.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:22.100
 Yeah no EQ so you're relying on the filter which can only be low pass or high pass.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.620
 Which especially hurts when you don't have multiple outs if you can't EQ it internally

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.020
 than you're kind of fucked.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.020
 Yeah.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.100
 It's like oh I need a route to a mixer.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.180
 Oh but I only have one stereo.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.300
 So yeah that's frustrating.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:40.980
 But I was the same situation as you that one the second night I had it or used I made like

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.380
 95 samples of like a year.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.700
 Which like I hadn't done that and with anything for a long ass time.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.700
 Exactly.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.020
 I haven't done that either.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.740
 Since I used to bounce stuff out of reason.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.740
 Yeah.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:00.820
 I looked at my old sample it's been like six years since I've made a pack of drum sounds.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.300
 You know what I mean.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.300
 Yeah.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.980
 But yeah it was instantly inspiring me to do that.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.980
 What the hell else was bothered?

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.900
 Big hit spring for a few different effects.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.180
 Oh polyrhythms dude.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.980
 You can't fucking do polyrhythms with it.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.980
 What do you mean?

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:19.460
 Like you can't set the sequencer to be different lengths per track.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.700
 Oh you can.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.700
 Yeah.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.700
 Am I missing?

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.700
 Yeah.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.980
 When you go if you hit function and what's that far right thing.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.540
 Track or whatever.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.540
 The page?

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.540
 Yeah function and page.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.540
 Yeah.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:36.340
 Then it says hit function yes to split this out into multiple tracks.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.340
 No shit.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.340
 I'm going to kick you to the other screen.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.020
 Yeah it took me a little to find that too actually.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.020
 Totally missed that.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.020
 That was bothering me a little.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.020
 I should not have made it.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.020
 Okay.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.020
 Well that's good to know.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.020
 Yeah.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.260
 Yeah but can you set each track to a different resolution.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.260
 Oh.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.260
 No.

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:55.820
 I don't know it's one divider for everything so you don't get different speeds.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.820
 Okay.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:02.740
 Because I did like the fact that you could divide but I would like to do that per track.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:03.740
 Yeah.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.780
 It kind of kills it if you can't do it per track.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:06.940
 It's always something.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.940
 It's always something.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.780
 I think I found this bug in my rhythm.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.580
 I was telling this to Dave.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.980
 So if I have a sample on a channel and I save something I bring it back up the next

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.980
 day.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.700
 Sometimes the sample will be super distorted and I'm like what the hell.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.540
 There's no overdrive, there's no filtering, nothing going on.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.860
 So I'd reset the sound.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.380
 I load the exact same sample on and then it sounds clearest day.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.940
 And I'm like there's no difference between anything that I've done here.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:32.940
 Yeah.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.660
 And it only happens on certain sounds because I'm like what the fuck is that distortion

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:39.580
 or it sounds like bit reduced or something and I'm not using that.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.580
 So I don't know.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.540
 Yeah I don't know what the deal is with that.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:46.420
 I could run it in the snacks with the rhythm.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:51.300
 Bad were your snacks, were they crashing snacks or things weren't working 100% right or just

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.300
 irks?

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.300
 Both.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.140
 I haven't had any crashes.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.340
 That was a thing for a while.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.340
 I know you did.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:01.140
 It seemed like it was pretty prevalent for a while but have they fixed all those?

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.140
 For me it hasn't crashed in years.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.660
 And I consider that to be one of the more reliable.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.220
 Oh I hope they get the digit act to be as reliable as the rhythm.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.860
 Which I think they're getting close to right now.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.020
 I know some people are still having problems but I can't.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.020
 I don't know.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.100
 I know some of those people are like yeah I'm not going to upgrade the firmware because

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.420
 this one still works for me.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.900
 I'm like were you talking about a fucking problem?

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.540
 Maybe you're using the latest one.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.340
 That makes no sense.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.340
 Exactly.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.340
 Software developer.

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:32.340
 You know what's in that new version?

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.700
 It fixes for the problem you're complaining about.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.700
 Exactly.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.700
 Because I haven't had any problems with digit act as far as reliability.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.340
 Even the first time I hooked up the little thing to transfer samples and shit I just

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.340
 assumed that was going to be a nightmare.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.940
 Everything just popped up the way I wanted to.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:51.780
 I've been practicing a lot using it for all the media of this live set and everything.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.100
 It's been dead solid.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.340
 It was a little confusing again going back to like maybe it's because I haven't had

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.260
 electron products in the past.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.460
 Figuring out like of this page is where I set the channel and this page is where the

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.460
 list is.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:07.820
 Oh they made it's more complicated on the digit act than it's on any of the other pieces.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.620
 Because you have that pattern level mutes.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:10.620
 Right.

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:11.620
 Global mutes.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.620
 Yeah.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.220
 And then when you're chromatic you have to be out of the mute pages and there are a few

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.620
 things like that to kind of remember.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.420
 It wasn't the end of the world but it was one of the things where like that was the

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.740
 compared to the sampler side.

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:25.660
 Where I was just like oh this is super intuitive and I need to go to the manual.

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:27.500
 That was the first time I was like okay I need to go to the manual.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.260
 I need to figure this out.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.860
 Kind of pissed that they don't have the instant pattern switching from the rhythm.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:36.740
 Where you could just boom immediately next step jump over to another pattern.

00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.020
 Especially with the digit act being all digital.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.020
 Yeah.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.700
 It's easier to like swap that shit out.

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:46.420
 I kind of was surprised actually because I assumed it was going to be the opposite.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.940
 Like I was going to hit pattern switch and it was going to do it right away.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.380
 I hope they can add it because at first they've been like no but won't do it.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:56.220
 And it's like well that's on your last drum machine and that's one of my favorite features

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:58.140
 of it.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.020
 So Greg you have another piece of electron gear.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.940
 Yeah I got the drive.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.700
 Which I like.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.060
 I got it for a hell of a deal.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.660
 How are you using it so far?

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:08.660
 I'm using modular through it.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.900
 I'm running the digit act through it.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.140
 My other drum machines.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.780
 Like I've just been experimenting.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.180
 Running everything through it.

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.300
 Like I do anytime I get a new piece of distortion gear you know.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.300
 Right.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.300
 Send everything through it.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.820
 Try to come up with interesting chains.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.100
 Does it take modular level pretty well?

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.660
 I haven't any problems with it.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.660
 Oh cool.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:32.900
 Yeah like it's definitely, things definitely go through it differently.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:38.260
 Like depending on what model distortion you're using and where you have your input gain

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.220
 at and things like that and how hot the signal is.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.120
 So I'm liking it overall.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.940
 Some of the different models on it are a bit I guess redundant.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.020
 Like there's not a whole lot of deviation between some of them.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:55.380
 There's just like three that really sound different from each other.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.900
 And I like them.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.740
 Makes me want to get a heat.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.060
 I do not want to spend $800.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.060
 Like yeah.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.060
 That's how much they are.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.060
 Yeah.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.660
 They're like 750 plus shipping at most places.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.940
 Yeah it's kind of insane for a distortion pedal.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.580
 Like this is basically heat.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.580
 Why an extra.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.580
 That's insane.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.900
 Why an extra input and input and the follower makes it twice the price.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.260
 I don't understand.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.780
 My eventide eclipse was like a thousand dollars.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.780
 Right.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:28.740
 And that's like ocean of fucking facts including distortion.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.540
 So yeah in light of that that's tough.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:35.300
 So yeah I mean as much as I would like a heat I think I'm just going to be content with

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.740
 my drive at the moment.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.020
 It's ugly.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.540
 I think it looks like shit.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.020
 It's a very beige.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.580
 It looks like a max.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.740
 Why does it have a three different stomp?

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.060
 One is your active non active.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.060
 Okay.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.340
 Because it doesn't have a dry wet knob like the heat does.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.660
 It has the on off for the effects basically.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:57.660
 No shit.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.660
 No dry wet.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.540
 It's a bypass switch and the other two are for presets.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.780
 But I have the preset mode turned off.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.860
 Cycle through presets or how does it work?

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.900
 Or do you just have one loaded cycle through?

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:09.900
 Okay.

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:10.900
 I'll like up and back or whatever.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:11.900
 Yeah.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.020
 Like there's a knob at the top.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:18.780
 You can disable preset mode and then you just freestyle it and that's all I use because

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.420
 that's not complicated.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.420
 If you're standing on stage.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.420
 You have four knob.

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.820
 Yeah I guess if you're staying on stage you want to say guitar pattern.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.820
 Yeah.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:26.820
 Which I'm not doing.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.820
 Right.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.940
 I'm going to reel it out for what I want to do with it.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:35.220
 The EQ is pretty nice for helping to bring out your harmonics I guess.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:43.260
 The base EQ sounds good and the mid can be used as like a cut basically.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:49.140
 You can have that cut or boost and then you can sweep that the frequency of it.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.140
 Yeah.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.140
 This is just 3D man.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.140
 I mean him a lot.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.140
 Yeah.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:59.540
 I still want to run the master through a heat really.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:00.540
 You know what I mean?

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.420
 Maybe unless you're using it very subtly.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.740
 Which I see people do.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.380
 Like in at least interviews.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.900
 They're like I take this archer track and at the end I run it through the heat.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.860
 I'm like oh that's like I'd be curious to hear the A and B of that.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.860
 Yeah.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.860
 And see what it's putting in there.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.540
 But I haven't yet running a lot of shit through drive.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:21.580
 I've been using it more than some of my other distortions now already.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.220
 I'd like to because I feel like my review of the drive was kind of boring.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.820
 I did want to talk about the 4MS STS.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:28.820
 Yeah.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.100
 You had mentioned it at the last podcast.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.100
 Yeah.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.100
 I like it.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.780
 I used it live a lot.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.820
 I feel like the OS still needs a lot of work.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.700
 I mean it's definitely not like archer track in a box or anything.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.540
 What would you like to see?

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.540
 Simple stuff.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:48.660
 Like the fact that when I turn it off and turn it back on it doesn't remember what sample

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.780
 I was on or what settings.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.060
 Is that going to be software solvable or is that a path?

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.340
 I think so because I actually emailed Dan for a mess.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.260
 I said dude I got a life set coming up.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:02.340
 Is there any way to make this remember where I was you know a power off and he didn't reply

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:06.580
 for a long time and I thought he was just going to like not respond and then the other

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:12.780
 day you just sent me a reply saying I hope to implement this in the future.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:13.780
 Oh.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:20.460
 Nicely cool because that would be very useful because like some stuff I had like bank B set

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:24.780
 for like reversed and things like that for the first sample that I wanted to use like

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.100
 you know the first song I knew that I wanted this sample and I wanted this sample and I

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.700
 wanted this one reversed and like I had to set that up at soundcheck every time and

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.700
 when I turned the modular off like after soundcheck and I turned it back on I'd dial

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.900
 that in again real quick and I was like shit.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.620
 Overall how many like button presses is that to get that set up?

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.580
 To get to the bank I was in like five.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.300
 That's double-end or there's a base when you turn it on and then I like I always know

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:53.860
 I got like attorneys a logarithmic turn this the second bank B but it's two seconds like

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.860
 it's not it's not a burden.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.220
 Yeah I mean it wasn't really a burden it's just.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.260
 But if there's enough of those steps you're going to forget one of them.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.260
 Exactly.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:07.260
 And that's nerve-racking for what's like a few bytes of data to store some preferences

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.140
 for which sample you're on and whether it's reversed or not.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:14.140
 It'd be like a bit mask I mean it's literally almost no data.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.140
 Yep.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:18.060
 I haven't used it for live recording yet which is one of the main reasons why I thought

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.060
 I would like it.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.060
 Yeah.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.260
 But instead I've just been bouncing things to the card.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.340
 I really like the idea like when you first started talking about getting this the idea

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.740
 of using it as like a like a version of like a loop or type thing.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:33.260
 A loop or pedal in a module and if you experiment with using it like that or not at all.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.420
 You're just so into using it as a sampler.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:39.740
 Yeah I've just been so into having the ability to do that in my module or now without any

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:45.700
 issues like I can just put stuff on the card go to it trigger it the way it wants.

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:50.140
 Now do you think having the Digitack and adding that into the mix is going to maybe

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:54.620
 free up or free up the 4MS to do things a little differently?

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.620
 Yeah.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.580
 I think so yeah because I have the Digitnow which is basically going to be like my sampler

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.580
 drum machine.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.900
 STS I plan for using weirder stuff.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:04.900
 Cool.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.780
 Motulated, heavily modulated sample manipulation.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:12.820
 A mangler and for long one shots like I was doing live.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.780
 It's a choir samples and stuff that I was mangling live that was all coming from STS.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.660
 That way I could have things like you know a rhythmic structure on the terraze stuff

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:29.780
 that was more freeform on top of that I was triggering with the STS with weird like probability

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:34.380
 triggers coming from the variegate and things like that.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.140
 That's kind of exactly the split I found with the Digitack in the 301.

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.140
 Yeah.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.340
 Especially for live use because at first I was like practicing and I'm like oh this

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.140
 301 this is out for live.

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.540
 I'm going to leave it in the case but this is way too much.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.820
 I started to realize like oh you can just trigger a long sample or do something that's

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.500
 heavily mangled.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.980
 Get around the 1LFO problem and at least be able to throw a bunch of CV at the sampler

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.740
 in there so it's starting to work its way back in like in light of that.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:07.380
 I did find a bug which was already patched though thankfully but I didn't have time before

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.180
 the show to patch it.

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.860
 My samples kind of got rearranged.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.460
 Something that you put on the card is color coded.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.460
 You know what I mean?

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:20.340
 You name the folder like color whatever dash your name just so you keep track of it.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.340
 Yeah.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:27.140
 For some reason it duplicated a couple of the folders once it like booted up and was reading

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.820
 the folders.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:37.820
 So like white bank 1 and like red bank 2 were no longer what I named them.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:40.500
 So like white bank 1 got duplicated.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.380
 So that became bank 2 also.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.820
 So then the rest of my color structure was fucked.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:50.180
 So I'm like trying to memorize what samples were and what color and it had been rearranged.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.980
 And I'm just like fuck.

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.420
 I'm like yeah I'm going to the banks and I'm like this isn't making the sounds that

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.780
 I remember it should be making and it was kind of a bunch.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.660
 Wait would you discover this?

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:01.660
 The day before the show.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:02.660
 So it wasn't at the show.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.580
 It wasn't like doing sound check because that's where I would have had a.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.660
 I didn't have time to like do anything about it because it was like the night before but

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.660
 yeah like.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:09.660
 But the very least it wasn't.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.660
 I was still trying to figure out alright this isn't blue anymore.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:16.500
 This is purple because that comes next and like you know because I had wiped out all

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:21.940
 the factory shit on like it comes with hundreds of samples from people like Richard Vine and

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:25.740
 even basic has like a couple banks and it's filled with samples and I was like that's

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.740
 great.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:27.740
 Don't want any of this on it.

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:32.300
 I just like immediately wiped it out wiped out the folder structure and like started creating

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.780
 my own you know color coded folders of shit and I was already trying to memorize all that

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:42.820
 in time for the show and then at some point the first bank got duplicated and it just

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:46.860
 screwed my entire structure and I couldn't remember what was what so I had to like play

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:47.860
 it by ear live.

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:51.620
 I was like okay it's not the right bank that doesn't sound right and I just like bounce

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.620
 to the next bank you know.

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:53.620
 I know it's on here.

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.620
 Yeah.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.620
 I just got to get somewhere.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:56.620
 But yeah.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.940
 Well you you hid those seems really well.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.620
 I did not notice that nor did I notice you panicking.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:03.620
 Yeah.

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:07.780
 I was actually trying to find the next oh god words of that you look cool as a cucumber.

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:08.780
 Thanks.

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:09.780
 That's right.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:10.780
 Weird expression.

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:14.140
 I mean it was all full of sounds that I would like to use live so it's not like I was triggering

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.220
 like oh this is my happy hardcore sound that doesn't fit here you know it was all stuff

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:22.180
 that could have fit into the live set anyways so like me bouncing around with shit kind of

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:27.100
 worked out it could have been worse and then I came back and I saw that he had already released

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.500
 I think it's version 1.02 now which I think fixes that.

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:36.660
 I will give Dan a lot of props for the like folder structure on there.

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.860
 I think it's kind of strange that you can only do 10 samples per bank.

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.820
 Ten is also weird because it's not like eight or 16.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:48.860
 Yeah I don't understand the reason for that maybe just because like it's easy to fit a

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.580
 resolution of 10 places on the knob.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:55.940
 Oh maybe in my opinion though like lose the knob at that point.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:56.940
 Yeah.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.820
 Go with like a rotator and a little LED.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.780
 And then you just have any number of them and you know where the end is going to be and

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.500
 it's going to just cycle back to zero.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.780
 And then you have a number of reference.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.340
 Yeah I think that would have been a much nicer design.

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.660
 It would have increased the cost to have two LEDs.

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.660
 I'm sure.

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:14.660
 But I don't know.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.060
 And it would not jive with the rest of his format.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:20.740
 Like he's come out with a bunch of new modules that all have that like format.

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.580
 They're all symmetrical down the middle of that kind of thing.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:29.100
 And it's cool I dig it you know and I like the fact that it's fairly simple to navigate.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.060
 You don't have to get lost in key combos.

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:35.060
 There are some but they're not like morphogene level confusing.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:38.180
 You have two buttons to do two hundred different things.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.660
 Because I remember like that was the killer for morphogene.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:44.860
 Like I think that's a great module and just a fucking horrible interface.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:49.140
 Like if they would have just done a better interface with that module I would still have

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.420
 one in my rack and I would be using the hell out of it.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.380
 So it's like a case study on like bad UX.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.620
 Like people should be studying.

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:55.860
 I mean it's make noise dude.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:01.060
 I bitch a lot about make noises interfaces and a lot of people love them.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.660
 So I don't want to trash it too much.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:06.420
 But yeah I feel like that module in particular extra bad.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:12.780
 Well it sounds like a variation of that is now working with this 4MS module.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:13.780
 Yeah.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:14.780
 Yeah I like it.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:17.980
 The sound quality is good.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.060
 No complaints in that regard.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:23.660
 And you can CV everything and do some really cool stuff with it.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.380
 I like it a lot.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:29.380
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:34.380
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:39.380
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.380
 Jesus.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.380
 Look at this module I built.

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.980
 It'll never make sound, but every once in a while,

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.380
 I put on my headphones and I go beep, beep, beep.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.880
 (laughs)
