WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.120
 [Music]

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.440
 It's been a month since it's not gone. Seems like we should probably talk about that.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.320
 I'm getting all out. Do we have to?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.120
 I have a couple of positive things.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.320
 Okay.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.320
 Yeah.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.480
 I jotted down highlights and disappointments and I didn't really get very far in either.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.000
 [Laughs]

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.080
 It made me realize just kind of how non-memorable this one was.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.160
 I was just like, "It wasn't really much good or bad, in my opinion."

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.400
 But I forced myself to jot a few things down.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.600
 I mean, would you like to start?

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.160
 Sure.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.520
 And you can start positive or negative.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.720
 I'll start positive.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:07.920
 My favorite part overall, I think, was the harsh noise demo Scott gave us of the bionic

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.040
 luster and herd stonut Mark III.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.560
 It was just nice to see the joy in his face, you know, just brouching us with noise and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.800
 like drowning out everything else in that room for a good five minutes.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.960
 Everyone else was just kind of stopping and staring at him as he just kept making it louder.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.680
 I don't know if you noticed, but there was like a good like 10, 15 foot like semi-circle

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.800
 of like no one else getting close to the booth.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 Yeah.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.600
 Like it was--

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.480
 Cleared out the aisle.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.800
 Yeah.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.000
 It was very effective.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.520
 It was.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.120
 And then it sold me on both of them, I think.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.800
 I don't own them yet, but yeah.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.160
 I mean, I would have walked out of there with them if he had them for sale.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.960
 Yeah.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.160
 The luster wasn't ready yet, but it's shipping as of yesterday.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.640
 So that's good to know.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.560
 And the herd stonut I just had been saving my pennies for.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.960
 I need to sell a couple plats before I can afford that one, I think.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.680
 He, uh, he's added a new mode since that demo also.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.640
 I don't know if you caught that.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.040
 Yeah.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.960
 And someone, uh, a friend of his mentioned that there should be a comb filter in there as well.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.840
 So he added a new comb filter mode at the end of the like mode rotation.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.480
 Uh-huh.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.960
 So.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.200
 Yeah.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.720
 Like the preset stuff he put into new modules to how it kind of simplifies some of the designs.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.360
 Good bit.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.600
 Yeah.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.800
 Being able to save stuff is more and more appealing to me lately.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.200
 Mm-hmm.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.840
 Likewise.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.400
 I'm.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.760
 But that was my number one.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.680
 Number two was, uh, being talked down to by, uh, Paul.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.840
 As always, as always.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.000
 Yeah.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.920
 Just made me feel, uh, good about myself.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.400
 Made me feel like a complete moron.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.440
 Listening to him to describe what his new, uh, E-520 can do

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.680
 and what it doesn't do.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.880
 But, uh, yeah, was that anyone else's personal favorite?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.040
 That's always a personal, like, yeah.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.200
 Yeah.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.200
 Yeah.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.000
 That's what I thought.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.240
 Okay.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.440
 I'll, yeah.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.040
 I'll let you guys elaborate on, on that experience a little more.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.280
 The Hyperion and Paul's, you know, obviously you want to ask Paul which reverbs he's going to

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.240
 put into it. Yeah.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.880
 Because that's what it's mainly targeting reverbs.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.440
 Absolutely.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.200
 Not special.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.240
 FFT effects.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.320
 No, they did anything can do FFT shit.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.480
 Yeah.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.280
 Anything can.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.960
 What we need is more reverbs.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.760
 More reverb.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.160
 Long tail.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.120
 They just don't exist.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.520
 Shimmering.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.320
 On tap market.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.320
 Can't get that stuff.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.520
 Paul's got your solution.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.680
 You know, the Hyperion looks cool.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.320
 It looks like he's trying to sell some before the Kickstarter to help

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.840
 make funds available to build them beforehand.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.120
 Um, Kickstarter, you got to wait till kind of the end of everything's over.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.520
 Yeah.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.400
 So that's kind of smart.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.240
 So he's got like a limited thing on his site now where you can go and just kind of pre-order one.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.040
 It looks cool.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.840
 I think it's pretty big.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.880
 I don't think I've seen like a picture of the actual finished module yet.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.240
 He's got the HP count and the like kind of prototype board.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.360
 But it sounded really good from what I heard.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.520
 Like the modulation stuff was like, creamy for lack of a better word.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.720
 But you know, it sounded like not like a shitty digital effect.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.600
 What you would expect.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.960
 No, yeah, it sounded quality.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.080
 Yeah.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.840
 Did he announce a final price for it yet?

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.240
 Yeah.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.960
 What is it going to be?

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.240
 I think it's under six, but it was like 590 or something.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.360
 Definitely not cheap.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.600
 It's up there in the range with like a rain maker.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.480
 Yeah.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.040
 But you know, stereo flexible processor like that?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.800
 No, it seems like it's worth it.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.120
 It's just not a casual purchase.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.600
 Yeah.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.560
 So that's it's going to be a boutique.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.880
 Yes.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.680
 What was your top module, Dave?

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.200
 Let me, uh, let me look at my list here.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.960
 Um, at the top of my list is also Scott's stuff.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.280
 I have Scott's new stuff and demeanor was apparently my number one, uh, thing demeanor.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.520
 Yeah.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.880
 No, he just liked the cut of his job.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.280
 Yeah.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.280
 Yeah.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.080
 I was what I'm saying.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.080
 Yeah.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.360
 Like you could tell he was just taking a lot of joy and just like blasting us with no reason.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.920
 Like, yeah.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.000
 And like at no point did he turn it down to do us.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.360
 There's a good chance he turned it up.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.920
 It was like you bought the ticket.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.200
 You're going to take this fucking ride.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.200
 Yeah.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.560
 It's 10 o'clock in the morning.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.440
 You just woke up and stumbled down from your hotel room.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.840
 Yeah.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.600
 Let me introduce you to Bionic Lester.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:29.040
 My, my top two things, but aside from that was, um, the brown shoes only guy who was running the LZX.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.280
 Yeah.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.960
 Booth, um, not only was the memory palace awesome, but his presentation.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.160
 Presentation and just excitement over it.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.000
 I really liked that way of presenting where he just started with like, here's a picture of a flower.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.560
 And then five minutes later, 10 minutes later, it's just been completely destroyed.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.320
 That was really effective, um, as a presentation.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.080
 I'm trying real hard right now to not fall into the video rabbit hole this year.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.440
 And like that kind of almost spun me, you know, complete offs the direction.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.440
 Like now I really want a memory palace.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.240
 It got me.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.480
 Yeah.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.840
 That's my number one for sure.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.160
 There's another one, but the memory palace demo is just like, okay, mind fucking blown.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.400
 Now I'm going to dive in deeper into this.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.720
 Yeah.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.600
 Originally, there was a lot of video stuff that I had on my list, my, to get, and now I'm thinking

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.920
 I could probably just make do with my, um, Ming mecha and a structure and a memory palace.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.480
 I don't know when the hell I'm going to get it, but it's definitely like, I must buy for me at this point.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.600
 I did see that they, um, apparently just identified like the big fix that was causing it to like,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.120
 figure out after multiple hours and it's actually involves, they're going to switch.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.880
 Everything was running off the SD card before and now they've found a way to use the on board,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.320
 like four gigabytes of flash ram that's right on the module.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.400
 That's going to help like alleviate that issue.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.240
 So that was kind of good because a lot of people have been having that issue with it.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.840
 It seemed very, at least a few people have been on the forum like talking about like,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.040
 eh, this isn't working.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.520
 Yeah.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.080
 I mean, I have the space for it's sort of, I think I can fit that in a structure in my

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.840
 video rack over there.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.200
 Hopefully.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.040
 We're still talking about knob gone.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.840
 Um, do we want to get in the structure or?

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.040
 Yeah, might as well.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.400
 Cause I, I, we have not actually talked about on the episode, right?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.880
 Yeah.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.720
 Not, um, since we got them.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.080
 I mean, that was another thing that was exciting, but it was by that point,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.720
 you and I both had structures.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.240
 So it doesn't really count as a knob con thing, but you're watching with me.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.800
 But you're watching this tone guys were there and we talked to them.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.520
 So it kind of counts as a knob con.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.400
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.880
 Yeah.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.640
 I mean, there was a lot of structures in use.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.080
 Again, for sure.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.920
 It's definitely, uh, steel on the show with the visual stuff.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.800
 So I'm going to put it out there.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.920
 Uh, I mean, so far module of the year for me.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.240
 Yeah.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.800
 This is like maybe my favorite module ever.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.280
 Nice.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.600
 I'm having trouble coming up with complaints about it.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.400
 Okay.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.960
 Also, I did video the other night for four hours straight.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.360
 Not even a single blip, not a glitch, nothing.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.440
 It just ran perfectly smooth the whole time.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.000
 Mm hmm.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.160
 Yeah.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.120
 I mean, you've, you've performed with it live a couple times already.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.200
 Yeah.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.880
 You've only had it for like what two months now or so.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.520
 Yeah.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.080
 Yeah.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.440
 And it's out of the box, hit random a bunch of times.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.600
 You're going to find something in a couple of minutes.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.560
 I mean, you can also dive deep into it, but it's also like,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.920
 if you just want to fuck around, it's fucking amazing just for that.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.320
 Yeah.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.480
 That's kind of what I had to learn with it to it first.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.240
 I was like, no, I'm not making all the shaders.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.600
 And it's like, no, no, no, no.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.440
 Maybe just use like your, your creativity to use these shaders in a way.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.480
 And especially since I added some analog video stuff to it,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.600
 it's like, oh, okay.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.960
 Now it's like really just processed the analog stuff with this.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.480
 So like it's, it's crazy.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:44.720
 Like structure by itself is still fun, but feeding stuff into it and using the video node,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.960
 but it just, it just makes it a thousand times better.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.200
 Yeah.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.480
 I'm going to have to, I guess, dig a little more into it.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.880
 Like I don't, you know, I haven't read the manual or anything,

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.600
 but like I was under the impression that was mostly like a generator

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.440
 and you would be running it into things.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:57.920
 It is.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.520
 Not necessarily processing with it.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.720
 So you have a bunch of the way that it's set up is you've got a bunch of these different

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.600
 node sets.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.160
 And the node sets are up to, I think it's four and then the output.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.200
 And then there's different combinations and they sort of relate to one another.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.840
 And there are, these, there are sets that have no other input.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.040
 They don't take video input.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.080
 It's all just generators.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.960
 It's all just shaders.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:25.520
 It's all feedback or the mixer or taking an audio signal and generating video from that.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.120
 But a lot of them have this video in node and there's two different video in

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.080
 you can do it through the RGB or another composite video.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.480
 And there's nothing stopping you.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:44.000
 And this is what I was doing at that, the BXC show was outputting and then feeding it

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.800
 right back to itself.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.280
 I know.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.800
 Processing it through the fluxes and then going back in and then that becomes part of the video

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.960
 node and then didn't even think of that.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.680
 Okay.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.800
 So yeah, you can use it like that.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.520
 Now they, and they keep adding nodes all the time.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.160
 Like each, they're already up to one nine, one point nine, I think is as of this recording

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.600
 is the version they're on.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.080
 And each one is either like a bug fix or here's a new node and here,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.480
 and then they add it to like the set of nodes that you can use and process.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.600
 So like the way that random works is if you have none of the nodes selected and you hit random,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.960
 it's just going to do everything.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.280
 But you can be like, oh, I like this.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.600
 If you just have that selected and you hit random, it'll only randomize that or whatever

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.800
 nodes you have selected.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.800
 Or you can just sit there and actually try to like go through the list of,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.800
 for each of the nodes and you know, start sculpting your own video from that.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.320
 Not only do you have that, you can then save those as presets.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.440
 And you have, I think it's up to 64.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.680
 You can save per performance.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.840
 And I think there's still a limitation only one performance per card.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.800
 But I think in the documentation they said they're going to make it so you can have multiple

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.520
 performances.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:58.400
 There's three different inputs for modulation and they are either five volt or one volt.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:05.360
 And one volt is so that you can hook it up directly to that's the the LZX range.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.880
 Plus or minus one volt.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.440
 Okay.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.920
 But everything else you can go to, you can little switch to go to five and then there's

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.360
 an attenuator on each one.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.720
 And then the top two, if you've got an audio node, you can send audio to it and then it'll react

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.680
 to that audio signal and do different things.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.640
 And you can bring up a mic at like a live show.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:24.960
 Yeah.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.440
 Oh yeah.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.080
 Yeah.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.400
 And I was like, at first I was kind of like, is this going to be like a cheesy club effect?

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.720
 Where everything is just pulse to the kick drum type of shit.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:34.720
 Yeah.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.200
 Yeah.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.000
 And I'm like, this is like.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.520
 It gets brighter when the kick hits.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.440
 No, it's actually really awesome.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.320
 There's a lot of fucking amazing stuff in there.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.240
 I think there's like one or two cheesy things.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:44.880
 Yeah.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.240
 The, uh, that's Circubent BPMC mixer.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.840
 I had had a audio modulation point as well.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.720
 You could like.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.120
 Oh really?

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:53.520
 Yeah.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.840
 I had like the touch contacts and it also had like, uh, I think it was like an onboard mic or something.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.200
 I can't remember off the top of my head.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.920
 Or I might have just plugged one in, but yeah, I could detect audio and make shit go crazy.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.480
 You know what I mean?

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.960
 Depending on how you attenuated it.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.360
 But yeah, I can see the usefulness in that for sure, especially in like a live environment.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.640
 The idea of like making an audio set and then going, okay, cool.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.160
 There's also a video component too.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.640
 Yeah.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:16.960
 Yeah.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.640
 But this was, you could do that with easily hook this up.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.760
 No doubt.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.120
 When you say you can load video clips into it, like, there are specific formats and like.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.480
 Yeah, it's a very rigid format.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.760
 It's a little bit small.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.640
 Okay.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.640
 If you just want to have a small loop of something playing as opposed to having to take the input.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.520
 And you get like 128 frames or something like that.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.440
 When I was doing everything in Resolume, I would like render out, you know, chunks and,

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.880
 you know, and then re-render, you know, mixing, mixing over and over.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.680
 And it would be cool to bounce some of the shit that I make in Resolume

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.440
 or have already made in Resolume into that.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.240
 I'm just, I'm not sure how compatible it would be.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.200
 You know what I mean?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.000
 But I kept everything on the lower resolution side back then because the laptop that I was

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.680
 doing everything from was garbage.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:10.800
 So like I had, in fact, one of the workarounds I used to do was instead of working with video

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:17.520
 within Resolume, because that takes up a lot of resources, I would put my sources on to a DVD

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:25.920
 and then use Power DVD, play it at a very slow rate and do screen caps because it had a built-in

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.320
 screen cap option in Power DVD.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.440
 So I would just take like hundreds of screenshots and just have a folder now of like

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:39.760
 bitmap files that I could dump into Resolume and play and sequence and essentially would be the

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.480
 same as video.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.760
 Wasn't smooth, but it didn't need to be, you know what I mean?

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.160
 I was in mangling video, like all the clips I did of like the nuclear bombs exploding and all

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.360
 that shit back in the day for Prometheus shows, that was all hundreds and hundreds of bitmaps

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.080
 being animated in Resolume and then re-rendered and fucked up even further because it's like

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.440
 just what I had to do.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.160
 You know what I mean?

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.440
 And I still have like folders and folders of all the stuff that I used to do,

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.640
 door and nose experiments, and I would like to eventually slap them in like structure or something.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.680
 Yeah, that's not going to be a challenge.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.280
 I think that would work lineup well.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.800
 And the other thing too is it's a node.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.960
 So this clip is a node so you can find a node set that maps that to a 3D object.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:27.360
 So now you've got this clip that's being fucked up in 3D space or you can do crazy shit with

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.560
 different feedback options or mixing options to fuck with those clips even further.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.920
 Can you load pictures into it?

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.720
 Yes you can.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.920
 Can you animate pictures doing like kind of what I just described?

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.680
 That would be cool.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.200
 I don't think there's something that'll flip through them in a sequence.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.240
 Like you can't load a folder of them and it'd be like play these as a clip.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.880
 You've got to make a clip offline and then use that.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.640
 Yeah, I love that it just uses totally different part of my brain.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.200
 Like it's been nice to come home from work lately and just do some video stuff because it's not like

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.720
 you get the same it's not all like gravy when you're using it.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.080
 There are definitely periods of like oh shit this is garbage garbage garbage.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.800
 But when you hit those points where it's like stuff locks up and you get that kind of flexible

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.840
 like okay I can take this a few ways that's a fucking wonderful thing.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.120
 It's never really wrong it's just sometimes much more appealing to you than other points.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.000
 That's another thing that's really exciting about this is they're super fucking active

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.680
 on the structure Facebook group.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.200
 Oh yeah I'm in it like even though I don't own one I've been paying close attention.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.960
 I feel like a a poser.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.680
 Hello fellow kids you know.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.280
 Hello fellow video enthusiasts.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.160
 Don't mind me I love structure I have three of them.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.960
 But yeah I've just been in there posing until I can get one trying to

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.760
 tease myself with everyone's updates.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.520
 But yeah like seeing them update stuff constantly just making me want it more and more.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.840
 It is fucking active it is.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.560
 Solid now too and like a lot of things you know it's actually like they took the time and it

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.200
 actually works really well it's not just limping along it's like like you said and used it for

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.200
 hours like no problems it's never really crashed on me.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.160
 Honestly too I could probably keep gushing about the structure.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.000
 Like there's other parts of it that we really haven't touched on yet.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.120
 Yeah I was thinking that too we could go for a goddamn while in the structure.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.520
 The only other thing from knob con that I'd like to bring up was my number two thing which was

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.360
 the Waldorf Chira and we were there.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.320
 I was just gonna say I had Chira on the list and then we'll talk about that.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:34.080
 Date for any of this I'm like when any time he's like no no idea and then you texted me today

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.800
 and you're like hey guess what you can order it sweet water right now.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.480
 It's like three grand or something but maybe a little less but it's like up there with the

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.760
 virus tie and I get it.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.480
 It's $22.99 it's actually cheaper than the virus.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.760
 Oh are they more than that?

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.760
 Wow virus is $29.99.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.200
 So it's fair like but it sounded fucking great.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.600
 Yeah I had to jot it down.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.400
 Completely ninja dropped that dude.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.760
 Yeah I didn't get it.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.960
 Me either.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.320
 If they would have then said like it'll be out now when I was at knob con I would have been

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.400
 plotting for that shit instead of blew it on a bunch of videos stopping.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.000
 What would it replace that you already have?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.800
 I don't know.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.920
 I would maybe maybe the blowfeld if it could but I bet they're going to be very different.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.680
 Like it's the synth engine made by the other company using the FPGA processor that they acquired

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:31.040
 the technology from so I would just be interested to see if it could be like the virus because

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.960
 it's still pretty big you know it's not like a more portable version of anything I have but

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:41.680
 I like Waldorf stuff if it's like part of the quantum stuff but you know it sounds really good

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.960
 and it's super reliable and it works really well that would be cool.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.360
 Yeah.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.960
 And if it's like effects per part which I think it was like which is one of the things the

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.080
 blowfeld couldn't do.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.720
 Yeah yeah so that's intriguing.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.360
 Yeah it's effects per part I jotted down a few notes because I was trying to compare it

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.520
 to the virus to see exactly like what is different.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.840
 It's very very similar.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.320
 Yeah.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.480
 And it's a little cheaper and from what I could tell it probably sounds a lot better.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.120
 Like it has a lot more like steps you know.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.800
 Like supposedly like nothing sounds alias at all in it or anything.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:23.520
 It's also got like fucking crazy polyphony like 128 voices and like each part can have like 32

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.320
 notes.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.680
 I think the virus if I remember correctly is 16 parts right.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:27.680
 Yeah.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:33.920
 This is only eight parts but the amount of stuff that you can have per part seems you know on

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.840
 par if not better than the TI.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.880
 You get four oscillators per part two main oscillators and then two subs.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.200
 Yeah.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.240
 The subs can have their own selectable like has different wave forms and modes that it can be in.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:53.040
 Or the two main asks you can combine into their hyper saw oscillator which is like I don't know

00:18:53.040 --> 00:19:00.080
 I'm supposed to have like six different saw waves like combined or you can run it in duo mode and

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.240
 then it's 12 saw waves combined.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:02.720
 Okay.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.800
 It's very similar to I guess the virus hyper saw as well but and then also per part you have

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:15.280
 nine stereo effects to select from three LFOs three envelope generators.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.880
 Wait is that per part per part?

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.240
 Yeah and there's eight parts.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:18.560
 Yes.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.200
 That's bonkers.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.920
 Yeah a lot of shit.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.560
 A little crazy.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.360
 Yeah because like the virus like does a lot of that too but you know part of it is like

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.000
 it's been around for a long time now.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.920
 Like I'm very used to the sound of it.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.480
 I like it for some things and there's some things that it sucks at.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.680
 Sonically like the blow felt a wipe the floor with it like on a sound level for me.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.280
 And I've heard that from other people too.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.880
 It's a World War four always manages to put like good drive and distortion.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.520
 I really dislike it on the tie to the large extent even though they have all these amp models.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.680
 I don't think it sounds like it's not what I'm looking for.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.280
 Maybe I just don't know how to use it right.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.000
 It's very possible.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.520
 I would agree.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.400
 Yeah like the virus here I was all over like the Prometheus stuff and I was

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.760
 disheartened to shit out of it. Most of that was not the onboard amp models.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.000
 I never really enjoyed them.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.840
 I always ended up running it through third party distortion anyways.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.520
 Yeah I don't know one of them on there that I like from a distortion standpoint.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.640
 It just doesn't sound right.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.240
 Right all of them were kind of close.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.440
 Yeah like each one was like oh that's almost good but yeah no none of them like at least

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.280
 I've never managed to configure them in a way that I liked.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.680
 And like the reverbs can't stand up to like a Valhalla or something like that.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.920
 Yeah that's you know that's a tall order but still it's not like the chira had some

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.880
 magic to it where some of the sounds were just like holy shit okay that sounds like very rich and

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:42.240
 very modern for lack of a better word like it's using cutting edge stuff.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.160
 It's supposed to be quality yeah I didn't get a chance to really listen to it.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.360
 I just I knew you were going to put it through its pace.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.920
 And I just took your European and you said it sounded good and I'm like I'll pay attention to

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.720
 this thing now.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.280
 But remember too when you were like where's the mod matrix?

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.160
 When I took a while for the dude to demo it and it did seem to be like an awkward location

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.160
 like you didn't just hit a mod matrix button and go there and like hit your attenuator.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.880
 Yeah I did forget to mention that it does have a mod matrix too.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.040
 Yeah which is cool that's one of the best things about the Volofeld and the virus.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.840
 It's like crazy nice mod matrix you know.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:22.560
 Yeah and we didn't interview anybody at knobcon but we did get some interview questions and maybe

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.160
 some of our listeners can help us.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.760
 We wanted to know what the one thing someone would burn it knobcon was if you had to burn one

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.480
 thing in the room.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:30.880
 Oh yeah.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:36.240
 They called it knobtoberfest this year which is out of fucking left field out of nowhere.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.320
 I don't know.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.920
 I ain't gonna lie dude I had no idea that this year was called knobtoberfest.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.000
 Because until we were standing in that hallway.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.320
 Yeah.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.840
 And I was like what the fuck is knobtoberfest and you're like this apparently I was like wait really?

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.760
 It's like I don't remember it like when I registered when I was paying attention to the updates

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.920
 never once did I notice that maybe I did see it and I thought it was like a joke.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.440
 Or you blocked it out.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.000
 Or yeah I just blocked it from that can't be real.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.400
 To be honest though yeah I think this was the least fun knobcon of all.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.120
 Easily.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.720
 Yeah it was just like I mean it wasn't bad but it wasn't good.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.440
 And certainly wasn't like fun.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.680
 Like we have fun but we've had more fun.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.720
 We amused ourselves.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.840
 Yeah we used ourselves.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.040
 Which we typically do.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.720
 But like we had to do it more than anything this time.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:33.360
 Like there was a lot of the same faces we've seen over the years and not many others this time.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:40.400
 It seemed like it was a lesser crowd and less performers and less manufacturers.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:46.960
 And it felt more like a like I don't know I've gone to many anime cons over the years.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.680
 And anime cons kind of develop the same like little clicks that start the form and then

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.640
 outsiders kind of stop coming because they're not part of these clicks you know what I mean?

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.960
 And it just becomes like its own thing.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.000
 I don't know.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.800
 It's kind of weird to see a synth convention get like that.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.440
 Especially for an industry that's like doing nothing but growing it's weird to see a convention

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.800
 like this shrink.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.600
 Which is a bummer because I still like going.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.520
 I still think it's a useful thing to go to.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.080
 We got to check out a bunch of stuff like deluge.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.800
 I got to see all of the updates they made and I end up getting one and I'm enjoying it.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.760
 It has problems.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.160
 There's a couple of things that I'm like kind of working through.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.200
 One is the I just did a bunch of things and I don't know what I did.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.800
 Thank god I'm like not really going to save this anyway.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.640
 Like they're still I still do a lot of accidental things because there's a lot of

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.840
 combinations and stuff like that.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.120
 I just need to use to it.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:44.960
 But you know last year's review of the deluge was this thing's kind of a shitty mono.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:51.040
 Yeah I made a huge advancements in the software and now it's totally fucking usable.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.200
 I probably wouldn't have known that if I hadn't gone to.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:53.840
 No I'm gone.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.400
 Yeah.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.200
 So it was cool.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.880
 Like I still want to go for that and I still just like these are people that we talk to that

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.320
 we would not talk to otherwise.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.280
 Speaking of like that type of scenario that's another thing I have listed under my

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.160
 my disappointments was a neo analog.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.240
 Oh yeah.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.480
 I know me like we're like really hyped that they were here this time.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.560
 Last year there are no show and that was like one of the first tables we hit.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:26.160
 Only defined no item core there like they did not bring their flagship product.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:26.960
 It was weird.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.840
 You asked about it and he seemed like he was already like tired of answering that question.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:31.840
 Uh huh.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.240
 Yeah.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:32.800
 I was like dude.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.080
 And it was first thing in the morning.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:34.640
 It was first thing in the morning.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.680
 I think there was the first people to walk up to him dude.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.880
 Yeah I just bring one.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.000
 I guess he knew he was going to be answering that question many many more times throughout the day.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.160
 But yeah what he he did not bring his flagship core for.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:55.680
 Instead he had a filter to show off your Iraq filter this time around.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.640
 And that was cool.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.160
 Like it sounded good.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:03.600
 It was like a nice filter but at the same time I'm like do we really need another filter in your

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.000
 Iraq?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.480
 Right.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.480
 Like I don't know and it's not for sale yet.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.920
 So I was just kind of surprised to see that that's that's what he brought.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.800
 Like yeah.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.760
 But if it would have been like parts of the I-teen core in your Iraq module at a decent price.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.000
 Right.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.120
 Yeah we probably would have left.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.600
 Absolutely.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.720
 With like some saturation module models in there.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.080
 Some sort of like envelope generator.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.560
 You know what I mean?

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:24.960
 I don't know.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.600
 It's just like a normal multi-mode filter from what I tell.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.480
 I was like that's cool.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.920
 Good for you I guess.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.400
 But like if he had had a core there would probably have walked out with one.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:34.960
 You know what I mean?

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.480
 Or at least got some hands on time which would have sold me or you know the other direction.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.800
 You know maybe realize that I don't maybe need this.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.280
 I don't know.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.680
 But it would have been cool to have some hands on time with one.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.560
 I was just surprised that you finally showed up and didn't bring one.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.080
 But regardless I bought one today anyways.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.520
 Having no hands on time with one.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.120
 So we'll see how that goes I guess.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.400
 You did spend some time with and we got a good demo of the Joe Mox Alpha Base.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.000
 Which you then did get.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.680
 Yeah and I sold that today also.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.920
 So to buy the I-2 core.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.480
 That was a this is as smooth as segues we're going to get.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:16.960
 Yeah.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.520
 Into that.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.440
 I don't know if we can do this any better.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.880
 I don't want to crap on it.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.880
 It's a good drum machine.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:28.000
 It's the sound is good like we discovered at Knob Con when we played with that one.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.720
 That was on display.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.320
 It's not the sound I have an issue with.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.600
 It's the interface.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:39.680
 It's kind of a very awkward machine to navigate and to tweak out on.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.240
 It's not that things are buried in menus.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.160
 Because it's kind of not.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.240
 The menus are only two levels deep.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.600
 But it's the fact that like things are broken down per row.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.840
 And you can only look at like one row at a time.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.120
 Like it's like okay I'm adjusting the pitch of the kick.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.440
 Okay now I'd like to adjust the snap of the envelope.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.960
 Well I have to go down to this row.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.680
 Turn this knob so that it pops up on the screen now and I can hit that.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.320
 You know what I mean?

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.800
 It's a little weird.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.960
 It's not the most like tweaking friendly interface.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.440
 And a couple times I managed to get into a mode

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.240
 that I had no idea what the mode was and I couldn't get out of it.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.360
 By accidentally like hitting things in the wrong order.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.200
 And then all of a sudden like things are flashing.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.800
 And I'm like what the hell did I just do?

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.680
 I don't know.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.640
 And it's like there's no indication on the screen really of what the hell mode I'm in now.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:40.080
 And little things that irked my OCD kind of triggered me was there's things labeled wrong.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:46.960
 The fucking tune and pitch on the kick is backwards.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.000
 Like everything's laid out on the menu like you know one to one.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.200
 Pretty much like there's four knobs so there's four options

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.120
 that'll pop up on the screen for that row.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:03.280
 The fucking tune and the pitch are reversed than what they are on the knobs.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.800
 And I'm like how do you do that?

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:10.560
 Like it's the first two parameters on the first instrument on the first track.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.800
 Like nobody caught that that's asked backwards.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.040
 The thing it's most known for is the kick drum.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.840
 Exactly and I was like if you can't even get the labeling right on the parameters for your kick.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.880
 Which this machine is known for like I don't think I want to spend a whole lot more time with this thing.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.120
 As a QA professional I'm furious.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:35.840
 But like I also own the modules the M-brain and the M-base at one point.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.720
 And again I love the sound of those two modules my main problem was programming them.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.800
 It's it was even more a problem you know what I mean?

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:51.200
 And I feel like while the circuitry of those are supposed to be improved in the alpha base.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.720
 I feel like the interface for them is no better.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.840
 And it's like at that point I might as well just have the modules again.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.800
 It's you know what I mean?

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:04.960
 But the sound was good like those are the only two analog circuits in there is the

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.160
 the kick and then the M-brain percussion.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.640
 Yeah the rest are all sample based.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.960
 But it's weird because they don't have the same parameters.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:22.080
 Like your hi-hats and all that stuff are different than the two that are just labeled sample.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.720
 So it's kind of weird but you can run them all through analog filters and the filter was kind

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.760
 of nice and you can adjust like the Joe Mox metallic noise which I'm a big fan of.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.400
 Yeah I mean I love their noise circuits and the filters.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:41.280
 Like I've spent a good amount of time now with different analog drum machines.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.080
 You know I've owned pretty much all the big ones from Riddem Tempest, Alpha-Baze,

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:55.920
 Drum Brute, Joe Mox modules. I don't know sound wise I feel like it's up there for sure but

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.320
 I just feel like it's not at the top of the list.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.680
 I think if anything I would still prefer a Tempest overall of them.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.640
 And I kind of miss the Tempest at this point.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:10.320
 It's not as flexible but that's kind of the point.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:10.800
 You know what I mean?

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.560
 I feel like the Alpha-Baze is almost too goddamn flexible that it's really problematic to dial in

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.120
 what you want. You know what I mean? It almost feels like they kind of want you to use it as

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.800
 like a preset machine and that's not what I want a drum machine for.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.480
 I would think like why doesn't he make something that's like a grand that just says the voices

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:34.160
 with MIDI and trigger inputs. Fuck the sequencer. Just have the voices maybe even not presets.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:39.200
 Just like easy to patch up a few knobs for each one and like a big rack thing or something.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.720
 Yeah I'd be into that.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.320
 I mean it's funny though when I first saw that that's kind of what I thought it was going to be.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.560
 Right. The way that it's laid out. The way that it looked.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.840
 Like the first time I was like oh that's fucking brilliant.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.760
 Still looking at the menu a lot.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.000
 A lot. Yeah that's yeah.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.640
 It's not divey but you're still relying on that tiny screen for pretty much any sense of where you

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.280
 are. You know what I mean? I'm not feeling that.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.760
 I don't know. I feel like he kind of shot himself in the foot a bit by trying to make it out,

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:13.360
 do everything because it doesn't need to. It just needs to do what Joe Mox does well and easily.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.440
 And you'd have a banging machine. You know what I mean? So parting ways with it.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.240
 So you're parting ways with it and you're getting instead.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:28.400
 You know I've seen Core 4. I've wanted one forever and I feel like after spending some time with

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:34.000
 that I don't need a more complex drum voice. I can already get as complex as I want on the modular

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.040
 and I can get another TR8s for when I want something simple.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.280
 What I need is more complex processing and the ability to do

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.400
 like what I used to do with the Sherman and just strange modulated filter

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:51.200
 mangling. You know what I mean? When you can take like the simplest of

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:58.160
 percussion sources and run it through multiple filters and saturation modules and modulation

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.960
 then you start to get to the area that my brain is working great.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:18.240
 [Music]

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.000
 Oh rolling. Rolling. Yeah. Almost forgot about that shit. Yeah so.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 Yeah my interest in that waned quickly. Oh over the course of like minutes.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.520
 Well because I was having a little excited about the tiny one, the little one on one.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.560
 I was like oh you're I'm just gonna put you in my pocket.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.240
 You're everywhere with me and then I was like oh you're fucking useless.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.600
 Yeah talk about menu diving. It's like the worst parts of the TR8s

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.600
 and a little fucking box with some pads. It's like oh you thought that was bad?

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.920
 We made it worse. Yeah I don't get it. I mean no neither.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:56.080
 Groove boxes are never known to be compact. Those are usually the biggest things on your desk.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.480
 You know what I mean? They're bigger than your average drum machine or you know desktop synth

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:05.840
 because you got a lot going on. It's a fucking workstation. Why did I decide to try and cram that

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:10.640
 into something you could fit into your pocket is a little beyond me with a screen the size of a

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.680
 calculator. The other thing about like Groove boxes is there's a performative element to it.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:20.000
 Like a lot of stuff is surfaced. You've got a bunch of stuff. That was the opposite of that.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.040
 Exactly. Yeah. Nothing. You were not going to jam on that thing.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.920
 No your lock didn't. You were not performing on that thing.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.240
 And it could do too many fucking things. Like you're going to use that little one-on-one to deal with

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:36.080
 like multiple loops, a drum machine, a synthesizer and editing all that shit. That's going to be a

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:42.720
 fucking bad day. Yeah. Yeah. So the even I mean so then right beside it was the 707. Yeah.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.680
 Which was the larger form factor. Which also so much reliance on that screen. So much.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:53.840
 You have to scroll down with the the little arrow keys just to see how many tracks you can do.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.760
 Which is 16. But like you can only see like what was it eight at a time.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.280
 Yeah. So like you have to scroll up and down and that's something you're supposed to be

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.440
 performing on. So you can't even see in real time the tracks that you're going to be like

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.160
 queuing up. That kind of bothered me. And there were some like project level limits that it's like

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.960
 that's all you get for a whole fucking project. Yeah. Yeah. That was the main killer for me.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.640
 Or like a beat or like a song. And it's like no no no. You got to do like a live set off that.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:23.280
 I can't stop. The clip launching and like the built-in synth engines and all that. I was like

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:28.960
 oh this thing might be like a terra's sp16 killer for me. Yeah. You know I generally was

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:34.240
 hopeful for it. But after seeing the demo I was like nah I don't think so. Like it has features

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:40.480
 that the sp16 doesn't have. But I'm sticking with my sp16 for now. And even going back to like

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.920
 the projects thing. I was like oh well maybe the switching between projects is faster because in my

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.640
 mind I'm thinking of like the electron. If I'm loading a project everyone like go get a beer.

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.040
 Yeah. Like switching between projects is a non trivial task. Like okay maybe they've come up

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.920
 with a way where you can switch a project on a beat. No it took just as fucking long. Like it

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:05.680
 had a fucking progress bar and everything. I'm like this is way less per project and I'm going to

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.920
 like be switching between it more often than the electron stuff. Right. And then we went over to

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.240
 the lose table and that dude was like loading new projects like in a fraction of a second.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.880
 Yeah. It was just like boop. I was like okay. Because that's kind of seemed like what Roland

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.280
 was going after. Like oh we're going to compete with like the deluge and the terraze you know and

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:31.760
 like the the Akai. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah I don't. I mean realistically they probably don't consider

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:39.120
 the deluge or what is it? Synth strum. Competition. You don't think they should have. I think they're

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:44.080
 their biggest threat right now for the price and the features like oh it's way better.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.960
 Oh but the problem is like you can't go to Sweetwater Perfect Circuit and get a deluge.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.280
 True. You have to order from them. It is a small fucking come. It's a small operation.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.360
 If more people knew about it I think it would be a bigger deal. I think it's just kind of

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.640
 just sliding under the radar there for a lot of people. Because like we said the deluge is

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.040
 kind of slow growth. You know it's been around since 2016 and back then it was not nearly as

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:13.120
 cool as it is now with like the audio and MIDI looping and like all that shit and like it's cool.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.840
 They update the front panels and you can actually for $20 get a new front panel with the new legends.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.960
 It's not like a million dollar thing that you have to send in to get serviced. It's just a couple

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.840
 fucking screws like they thought about it. You know. Whereas the 707 of the 101 just seemed like

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.400
 fucking rushed out marketing shit like they designed that in Photoshop and then built it.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:37.600
 If the deluge had a screen I would own one immediately. It's just that lack of screen that

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:42.960
 still turns me off. Part of it that got me was like the editing and the lack of the screen and

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.920
 I felt like I realized like oh I'm super spoiled by a electron stuff and I need to be able to edit

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:52.400
 like a bunch of parameters at one time. Kind of like you were saying with the Joe Mox. Like I

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:57.760
 don't want to like individually but I was just thinking about it the wrong way really. It wasn't

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.320
 it didn't meet my specific needs so I kind of bailed on it because I wanted to try other shit.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:10.560
 So I could have gone further with it and I didn't. I'm super happy with mine but the synth engine

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:16.960
 is just absolute fucking garbage. It's so bad. I don't think it's bad technically.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:22.160
 I just think their idea of what people would want out of a synth engine on a drum machine like this

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:27.680
 it just misses the mark. Everything is just like giggling, using cheesy.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:34.080
 This one thing I will give the 707 is that the synth engine in there seemed capable. Yeah and

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.480
 like you could get some good sounding stuff out of it if you felt like diving through all those

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:44.880
 menus and entering what he was showing us as the advanced mode. Oh god yeah. To get to the extra

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.360
 parameters so you could actually edit the synth sounds. Deep parameters like filter cut off.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:55.200
 Yeah I definitely had a vibe of like dude you are not reading the room. Yeah yeah. The thing is

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.960
 though like that's not what I need in a performance group box is synth stuff. Like it would be cool

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.520
 to maybe do like a few acid lines here and there you know on the box but for the most part I wanted

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:11.200
 something that could do clip launching nicely you know what I mean and conveniently which that

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.600
 doesn't because you have to rely on that crappy little screen. I think that actually is something

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:21.120
 the deluge solves. It is. I mean it does for sure. Really good job with that. I'm saying if I had

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.760
 a screen I would buy that instantly. It has the features exactly what I want I think wins over

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:34.160
 like the 707 and the SP16 and even the Akai stuff. But I don't like the whole like monomone only

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:41.520
 tiny little LED buttons as my only like feedback of what I'm doing. You know what I mean?

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:47.840
 Yeah that's like that's I think that's illegitimate and rational critique of it. Like I've already

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:52.480
 seen progress and I'm starting to be like oh I see what you're doing there and there are these

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.200
 sort of like repeated patterns. They have not everything is just like this sort of like crazy

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.800
 in different way. Like I'm like when that guy was giving us the demo at knobcon and he's just

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.360
 bouncing the fucking round and like everything's coming together. It's not out of the box. You're

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.920
 not going to pick this thing up and immediately grock it. You're a more patient man than me.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:17.760
 Basically what I want is Octatrack and Abilson Live in a box with a screen like the SP16.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.440
 I would argue that Deiluge is the monom in Abilton.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.080
 Like great together. Definitely.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:28.720
 That's and I like both of those. The monom didn't work for me because I got a little bit lost in a

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:34.400
 sea of contextualist buttons and I'm like I don't know where the fuck I am. So it solves that problem

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.960
 and I'm really familiar with Abilton. So like it's working really well for me.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:44.240
 Yeah like the MIDI sequence or a lot. I think the MIDI is fantastic on it. Just the way like the

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:49.360
 colors like that really struck me like when I was like I'll miss that part of it knowing that

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.600
 like oh yeah that yellow part. I could like the way you could scroll the sequences and see this

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:58.160
 stuff. I was like oh I know what that is just by looking at that fucking LED visualization.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:02.080
 I'm like that's fucking cool. Like more things should leverage that type of stuff.

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:08.320
 And the fact that you can set all of those. Yeah yeah which is really nice. In the luminosity.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.800
 Very I was like oh this is a little fucking bright. I didn't even realize that's cool.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:20.080
 Yeah. Do you also know that you can load a single cycle? Yeah. I'm shooting on the synth engine

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:26.400
 but I do think you can overcome that with just grabbing a bunch of single cycle stuff and loading

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:31.120
 loading those on. I haven't done that yet so I don't have a review of it. I have the filters and

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:36.640
 shit sound though. They're pretty good. The filter is fine. They self resonate. The

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:42.800
 no it's digital like take it then like just not like an analog filter built in here. Sounds like

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.760
 an a vloggy but it might be a really good model but I'm guessing it's digital. The main thing

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:52.800
 that really sucks though is the reverb. Okay oh yeah. It's fucking garbage. So that was a little

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.920
 disappointing because I'm always like it'd be cool like if it was like a at least good basic

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.880
 reverb and the saturation. There's like one good value. It's like nothing nothing too much.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:08.880
 All right there's like a little spot in there. That said though they are still

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:14.640
 very much at working on it. So that might be something to end up solving. We've table oscillator

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:20.160
 coming that'll be you know since the FM shit was so clicky. Did you notice that like it?

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:26.400
 Yes. Like it's fucked up like just set the phase to zero on every hit like it's wrong.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.240
 That's it though. That's my list of complaints right now and I'm glad we went to knobcon and

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:36.880
 that guy showed me. Cool. Oh oh I don't know where's this going.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.360
 Now you remind me what my most favorite thing of knobcon was getting some hands on time with the

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:48.560
 WMD crater. Fucking amazing module. What about that? Amazing module like I wish I could have

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.720
 bought it like immediately but it's not on sale yet for like a couple more months like you possibly

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.440
 bought into the year. Wow yeah. Wonder what. A little bummed about that. I don't know but I'm

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:03.760
 incredibly hyped for that. Like just fucking around I was able to dial in like multiple sweet

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:08.960
 spots like you know at the booth through the crappy speakers I could still detect like the

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.800
 punch and the body and the tick you know what I mean. I was like hearing like oh yeah I could

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.040
 retour that to a sample. So for listeners who may not be aware of what this is.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.760
 What is the crater? I'm pretty sure it's analog. I can't remember off top of my head.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:27.280
 I think it is. Yeah it's an analog kick voice that has like its own

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:35.040
 three stage saturation circuit. It has its own body section and like you know pitch and tone.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:40.880
 In like 12 HP. Yeah it's tiny. Yeah it's very tiny. It's like the same form factor as like

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:46.720
 the crucible module which is the new symbol module and things like that. And it comes

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:53.840
 black panel. Real simple like no thrills really. It's just like straight black panel.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:00.480
 You know white labeling. Real clean. It seems like a fast well thought out interface for a

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.800
 kick drum. Like better than any other kick drum that I've owned and I think I've owned almost

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.680
 all of them. At one point you know I've tried quite a few and it just seemed to cover all the

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.800
 territory that you want out of like a techno drum. You know what I mean. Yeah. I mean I don't think

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:19.440
 it went all the way down to like organic sounding drums. No there's no physical modeling type

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:26.320
 shit but like it definitely covers your entire like 808 to 909 and everything in between.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.720
 It does some interesting stuff with gate lengths too to the point where like you can almost have

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:36.240
 it sound like two different kicks layered on top of each other with intelligent gate sequence.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.880
 Oh that was a cool feature. Yeah like it'll hold for as long as the gate and you can hit it with

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:46.240
 like accent on top. So like it was doing some interesting like like you had your 808 long

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:51.680
 kick and then like your snappy punching 909 almost on top of it all in one voice. You know.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:58.560
 Yeah. I was really blown away by it. I hope they release more drum modules like in this form

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.720
 factor. Yeah. You know like I could definitely see a nice snare coming out like that. You know

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:14.960
 and some other stuff. Yeah. I would build a whole drum kit out of it for sure.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:38.720
