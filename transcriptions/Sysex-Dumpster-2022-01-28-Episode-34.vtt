00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 [Music]

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 So here we are. Here we are. Here we are. Not here. Again. Back in the box. Back in the box.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 It's like, uh, it's like in that movie, Virtuosity. Oh shit. Yeah. I forgot about that.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 When Sid thinks he's out of the box at the end, you know? Yeah. He tries it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Then he realizes he's back in the computer. He can do anything he wants.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 It wasn't very movies still from that movie. Wasn't that your first website or at least the one?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Oh fuck Dave. How do you remember that? That was like in 2000 when I made that website. Jesus.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Because the only reason why I can say yes is because I recently stumbled upon old photos I had saved from that time frame and I was like,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 "Oh yeah, that's my old website." I totally forgot about that. I can't believe you remember that. That was my DJ site. Yeah.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Yeah. I edited picture Sid doing his little scream orchestra thing.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Remember Jeff, a friend of ours sent it to me and was like, "Hey, do you know anything about this guy?"

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 And I was like, "No, but clearly we need to talk to this person." It was one of those social barometer passing immediately.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 I remember that site because it was love at first. Thanks. Yeah, it was great. I really did enjoy it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 A big fan of that movie even though it's cheesy as fuck. Yeah.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Should we watch that? I love all 90s VR tech related films.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Speaking of which, episode 34 brought to you by Matrix resurrections.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 We got the sports theater near you. Watch your childhood die.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 God. I take it. We all saw it. Yeah.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Dave saw it in my place, I think, right? Yeah. No, I was there for it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Yeah, that's right. I saw it that night after, I think.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Dog shit. I enjoyed it. Dog shit.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 My expectations were very low, which I think helped. And I also knew, like, after the first, I was like,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 "Oh, this is getting like real meta and breaking down some fourth wall and stuff."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 I just sort of relaxed and was like, "You know what? I'm just going to enjoy this for what it is."

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Because I think that helped me enjoy it. Because I know there's a lot of complaints and there's a lot, you know,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 people have a lot of problems with it. But I don't know. I feel like they had a lot on their minds and they got it off their chest.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 I enjoyed it more as it progressed. Initially, I was stunned by some things in it.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 And I was like, "Wow, this is where it's going to start at."

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 But it got a little more interesting and more fun. And the self-referential parts of it were, you know, good.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 But...

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 I didn't like the fact that so much of Keanu Reeves' resolution to fight issues was just pushing people with what appears to be some kind of Jedi push.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Considering the fight scenes. The fight scenes in the original movies were amazing.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And obviously he still has the chops because he's doing John Wick movies and the fight scenes in those are amazing.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 This just seemed like, how did you not combine, you know, an aging Keanu Reeves who obviously can still do it with, you know,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 the expectations of a Matrix movie having amazing action and then him just kind of walking around and putting two hands up and pushing people away.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 That was...

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Of all the complaints I had, I think that was the one that was like, "This is making this a little tedious."

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Yeah. It felt very tedious.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Great. I'm done. Like, I can see you, like, I can see you work doing this over video. So I can see, like, you looking anxious.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Like, what are your thoughts on the new Matrix movie?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 You know, I don't know. I liked it and I didn't like it at the same time.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Like, for every part of it that I liked, there was like two parts that I thought was cheesy.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Like, like, you were saying the action scenes, like...

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 I don't know, they were so breakthrough, you know, groundbreaking with the original.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 And even with the sequels, they're still good. Like, the action was, like, even if the story started to suck in two and three,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 at least the action scenes were still cool.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 This, it's like, they, you know, dropped the ball in the action a lot, but the story was actually decent.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Unlike the other sequels, in my opinion. Like, I kind of liked where it was.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Some parts looked amazing. Like, every scene in the machine world, I thought, was fantastic.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 The whole, like, what the hell was it? Like, the Stingray robot thing that was, like, carrying it.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Like, the robot thing that was, like, carrying Trinity and stuff like that in the machine world.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Like, all the robots looked cool and stuff, but then, like, some of the scenes in, like, the Matrix looked like a fucking made-for-television movie.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 You know what I mean? Like, I don't know. It was just strange. Very, like, consistent.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 The cute, helpful robot thing, you know, it was just like, none of this lands for me, you know, it seems like...

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Not...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Super...

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 I don't know. Like, it wasn't very well put together.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Hmm.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 I'm just strange, though.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Yeah, I don't know. On one hand, I was happy to return to the world of the Matrix, you know, 20 years later or whatever, but...

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 On the other hand, some things are just, you know, better left alone.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Like, yes, I don't know.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 I wouldn't mind seeing more. Just, I don't think they should be directed by Lana at this point.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Like, I think she's tapped out, you know, I think she should let someone else roll with it.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 I mean, fuck, let the people doing John Wick do it or something at this point, you know.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 I would love to see, um, after the original Matrix movies, and I forget when exactly this came out, they did the Animatrix, which is a bunch of animation shorts in that universe.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 I thought that was fucking amazing.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 They did another one of those.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 It was the best Matrix sequel, for sure.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Yeah. Like, an updated version of those, I think, would... I totally be fucking fired up for.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Yeah.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Yeah.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 It was a lot more satisfied with, like, the Tron reboot for comparison.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 I just thought for the series and for the stature of it, that this was a failure.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 I would agree in that regard, for sure.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 In fact, that popped in my head a couple times as I was watching it.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 I was like, you know, I remember being in the theater in the iMacs and watching the Tron, you know, sequel and thinking, "Yeah, fuck."

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 You know, like, this kind of nailed it, you know, and it's been so long since the original, and like, I was kind of...

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 It's... that sequel felt more Matrix-y to me than any of the Matrix sequel, you know what I mean?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 So, I was kind of hoping that this would be like that, but not really.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 And the sound design was trash.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 It was, dude.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 Yeah.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 The sound design was kind of bonkers trash.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Even though it sounded mixing, like the simple shit, like the vocal, you know, mixing, I thought was really fucking weird.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 It was really hard to hear some parts.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Anytime bugs talked, it was like inaudible.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 You know what I mean?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 It's...

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 I don't know.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 I mean, especially when you compare... I mean, we're obviously going to continue to compare to the Tron legacy.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 The sound design for that was fucking incredible.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Yeah, fantastic.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Like, from the soundtrack to the... to the incidentals, to the foley work, to all the mixing.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 I mean, honestly, this conversation is making me just kind of want to go back and watch that again.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Yeah.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 I mean, I'm not even like a fan of Dafpunk, but saying, I can't deny that I bumped that soundtrack on a regular basis when that came out.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 That's one of my favorite things they've ever done.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 That soundtrack.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Since we're all taking SIP's crucial question, what do y'all drink it?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Got some Asangia water there?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 The Grag, I see?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Yeah, I just had my green sludge vitamin mix, and I'm washing that down with some plain old water.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 And a Trader Joe's blueberry lemonade seltzer. Nothing fancy today.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 It's not called green sludge, right? I mean, it has a different name, doesn't it?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 No, it's called Athletic Greens.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 This episode of Sisex Dumpster brought to you by Athletic Screens.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 In every tasty scoop, there's enough B vitamins to keep you patching through the night.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 That sounds great. Could I get some? Where could I get it?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Sure can. Just enter code Sisex Dumpster6969 on the website and save 3%.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 That's big savings. I can't wait to get my Athletics Greens using the Sisex Dumpster code.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Does the green sludge work, Greg?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 I'm drinking it for a while now, so it must be doing something.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 It's been a couple months. I enjoy it.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Because I was deficient in B vitamins, and the supplement I was taking was like...

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Sometimes not enough, sometimes too much. It was really weird.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 But this seems to be a good mix.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 It's a fucking vitamin that you drink.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 That's about it.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 I noticed I have more energy, like an hour after I drink it.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 That's about it. I have no idea if anything in it is actually doing anything else and keeping me healthy.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 That's what they claim.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 How old was it?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 I'm drinking a lager from an old thunder brewing company.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 It's kind of local. It's in Bolognaux, burrow.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 The only thing in Bolognaux that I'm aware of is pianos and stuff.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 That cafe that's kind of across the street from it. That's pretty good.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 I'm amazed that there's anything worth mentioning in Bolognaux that isn't pianos and stuff.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Is it on the come-up? Is it the next gentrified area?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 It sounds like it.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 They got a microwave.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 It's like suburban-ish and it seems like it's always been that way for a minute.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Because I kind of used to work out there when going to work involved getting in a car.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Yeah, because you were the one who told me about that cafe that's...

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Yeah.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 That is delicious.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 It is delicious.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 It's definitely worth going to after going to pianos and stuff. I don't know if I'd go out there just for that though.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Yeah, they were kind of at least at the start of things too. They were like, "Yeah, we're never going to wear masks in here.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 None of this is real too." And that kind of turned me and a few others off from being like, "Yeah, you're cool, but not real."

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 That's a bummer.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 Cool people.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 What about you, Nick? What are you drinking?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 I'm drinking this Kentucky Christmas morning stout that my brother gave me when I saw him over the holiday.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 And it's like almost 12%. I don't like stouts, but this one tastes kind of like chocolate milk in a way.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 So I kind of like it more than others.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 But today, kind of necessitated a beer.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 I have not been drinking much at all.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 It's a beer kind of day.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Yeah.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 That's fucking sure.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 So it's been a while since we recorded.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Oh, it has been.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 It's like, it's like November.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 Yeah, it was November.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 It's been too bad then.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 We released it in November, but I think we recorded it in like early October, right?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Yeah, maybe...

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Maybe, yeah.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 That's cool.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Well, high-new listeners.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 Yeah.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 Sorry that your life is legit here.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Oh, no, no, they're getting that sweet deal on green sludge.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 It's already paid for itself, really.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Right.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 Yeah, it's just dawning me like 34 episodes.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 It's a lot.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 It is.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 It's a lot.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 And no babbling.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 No, we won't give any of you any discounts on any sales.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Yes, stop asking.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Please, people.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 I'm glad that you listened, but that doesn't mean you deserve a discount.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 You should give us a discount.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 This like, "ought-lowball offer I got on Reverb" for like a mint-pear mid-work 3.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 That was like some shameful shit.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 They tried a few times too, like, "but I'll pay you in cash now."

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 I'm like, "yeah, everyone's gonna pay right now.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 This hell-fucking Reverb works."

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 Like, "I'm gonna get paid."

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 I get it.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 And luckily it went to some very cool, seemingly not male composer

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 who was super psyched to get a pyramid, so that made me happy.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 That fucking douchebag that wanted it for like, "wait, and I was the lowest one on Reverb too.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 I was already like, gone into sell.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 You know what I mean?"

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 And they were like, "how about 200 bucks less?"

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 I was like, "fuck you, I would keep it for that."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 You know what I mean?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Like...

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Yeah.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 No, that's the best dude.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Like, when someone comes at you with a really shit offer, and you go back and forth, and you

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 start to contemplate it, and you're like, "well, okay, maybe I'll have a little bit of money."

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 "Okay, maybe I'll hook you up."

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Like, I don't know.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Like, no one else is bit on it yet, and I'll take a loss, whatever.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 But then you're like, "you know what, no, you're being an extra douche, fuck it, I'll just hang on to it."

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 And then out of nowhere, someone who's like, really genuine, and not lowballing you, comes

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 out of nowhere with an offer, and it's like, "yay, it's going to a good home.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 I didn't get screwed over."

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 You know, that happened with the metropolis and stuff like that.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 Like, dude, they kept trying to lowball me on muffs, and like going back and forth.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 And eventually I told them, I was like, "you know what, the deal's off man."

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 He was like, "oh, well sorry, you feel that way about another $10."

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 I'm like, "no, it's not about the $10, it's about the fact that like, I gave a price, you lowballed it.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 I even counter offered, and then you lowballed that again."

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 You know what I mean?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 It's like, "no, just, no dude."

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 And then the next day, someone paid full price, you know?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Yeah.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 And there was also those modules that ended up going to Kid 606, that someone tried to lowball me on, and I passed.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 And then I was like, "okay, cool, now it's going, someone that I'm really happy to see it.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 I know these people are going to use it."

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 You know, all these people that are lowballing are just trying to flip it on reverb, you know, the next day.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 That would have been $20, or $50, whatever.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 It's like, screw you.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 That shit would have been on reverb the next day for the same amount before it even arrived.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 If we want to lay out a formula or a format for this episode, how do we want to approach this?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 We want to, uh, we're watching a lot of letter Kenny.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 So the first thing I thought was, "how do we want to fuck this pig?"

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 Which was like, not a great way to say this, but...

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 It's the end of the year, kinda.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 You know, it's weeks after the end of the year, but we didn't really do a recap of 2021.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 A year that seemed both incredibly short and infinitely long at the same time.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 So you're still like a freshly lit Newport cigarette, 2022?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 [laughs]

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 So we, we joked at the start of 2020 in our, I think, yearly wrap-up that, uh, 2020 was going to be the year of granular.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 And that was correct for the most part. There was a lot of granular stuff that came out throughout that year.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 2021, last year, we joked that 2021 was going to be the year of lush reverbs.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 And I think that was kind of spot on to, there's been a lot of big reverb modules that came out.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 Um, I was going to ask everyone before we got into our reviews, what do we think 2022 has in store for us?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 So you're asking us to use this power that we didn't really even necessarily know we had to predict the future, to predict trends.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 I mean, what we, what we say right now could affect the stock market.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 It could, it could.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 It's in our hands, dude.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 I don't know if I'm, I don't know if I'm ready for this responsibility.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Her life is in your hands, dude.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Her life is in your hand. He asked me to repeat that.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 [laughs]

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 [groans]

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Yeah.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Fuck.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 What will it be?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 Maybe things from 2021 actually coming out will be part of it.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 [laughs]

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Yeah, that's probably a big one.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 I was going to say 2022 is going to be the year of the hybrid.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 Mm.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Mm.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 So what are you basing this prediction on?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 I'm basing that on the fact that 2021 was plagued with sparsity and component shortages in the world of modular.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 And I think it's going to push both manufacturers and enthusiasts to go back inside the box to bring their designs out and create music, to some degree.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Not all the way, but to some degree.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 I think the days of a new modular company popping up every week and putting out yet another envelope generator are over.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 Oh, absolutely.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 You know, I think the companies, the big names that have established themselves leading up to this point are going to remain solid, but we're going to see fewer but more innovative designs from them.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 I think you have to be selective.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 I think you have to be selective.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Yeah.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 Because of this part shortage, because of the time to market, you could get away when getting parts was easy and convenient and cheap.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 And, you know, if you made an envelope and you threw it out there and it was indistinguishable from the rest, but, you know, a couple people bit.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 It was worth it.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Or, you know, now that I think I don't think there's a lot of room now for a module that's not going to sell particularly well or not stand out.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 It's, but I think we've made this prediction in the past that the days of the, you know, we're not going to see another Pittsburgh takeover.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 We're not going to see like the next simple utility company.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Yeah, it's got to be innovative.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 And all that stuff is out there.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 I mean, you look at Reverb, not flooded.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Maybe isn't the right word, but, you know, if you want nuts and bolts, modules, you want to get started.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Every function you want, there's a million of them out there and there's a million of them on Reverb.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 It's the used market right now for that stuff.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 It's saturated.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 And I think like you're saying it'll fragment like there won't be another Pittsburgh modular, but there will be a bunch of other people like G storm elect or another people that are making like 20 of something and putting it online because you can't even get like, I was just looking at resistors to try to build a DIY kit

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 the other day and it was like minimum like 2000 or 200 for an order to get something.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 It's like, oh shit, like the gravy train for even being able to build something that became like 20 times as much of a pain in the ass.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 And I don't think that'll ever stop now.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 I think it's always going to be tight now.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Yeah, a decade ago, like when modular was starting to take off, it was the price that was keeping most people out.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Now, it's price and availability.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 And I think it's going to go a few steps backward to where it was like a decade ago where only like the really enthusiastic people were getting in the modular and it was more, it was considered more of a boutique, you know, thing.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 It wasn't that mainstream yet.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 You know what I mean?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And I think it's going to go back in that direction.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 And everyone else is going to be forced to go into like a hybrid type situation kind of like I'm doing, which I'll touch on later with, you know, my top picks for 2021.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 But yeah, that's that's how I see it.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 You know, obviously the shortages aren't going anywhere or getting any better rather.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 Now availability of stuff is hard right now, even if you can afford the inflated prices, things are still hard to get right now.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 It's it's a bad time.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 I don't even think it's the supply chain per se either.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 That's like definitely what's happening now.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 But that's like the start of the new change of like it's going to be harder to get things just period because they're going to be there's not infinite cadmium in the world.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 You know, there's not infinite lithium.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 There's not all these resources that you need to make things.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 So people will have to be more selective.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 But it was kind of natural anyway.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 It was too big.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Yeah.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 And on top of that, you got your shipping costs and delays and yeah.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 And inflation inflation's not any better.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 Yeah.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 People don't want to wait a year for a drum machine sometimes.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 You know what I mean?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 They might just be like, Oh, just, you know, go back in the box.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Like Greg was saying, just use something like that you can create a virtual plugin.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Yeah.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 Yeah, 20, 2022.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Thinning of the herd.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 Yeah.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 That's my prediction.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 Okay.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 I have a more abstract prediction.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 I'm looking at the success of the poly and tracker.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 There's not been a ton of innovation in, at least in the software side of trackers.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 But basically looking back and going, what can we take out of a computer and put in a box?

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 And I think that the success of the poly and tracker, I think maybe is like what other things can we put in a box that.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 That.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 Isn't just a groove box.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 It isn't just an electron box.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 It isn't, you know, basically trying to be a little bit more innovative.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 I think the days of like an NPC knock off or an electron.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 Yeah.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 Knock off.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 I just, I.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 For the same reasons that I mentioned above, I think like if you're going to come to market, you've got to stand out.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 I think you got to swing for the fences now.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Yeah.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 And that's what I think like.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 There's this complexity ceiling to that I think people even reached with a lot of these things and how feasible it is for a company to put out these like many computer.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Like.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 So I retweeted from our Twitter account, like that picture of somebody playing live in some club.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 They're about to play a jungle set with just two of those M8 trackers and then one of those.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Yeah.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 Ten ten mixers, like the blue box mixer, whatever it is.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 And that's what I think like the theme to is going to be like less people realize like you don't need like that much to do what you're trying to do.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 And you probably should just get by with less.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 And these things are so powerful now, like just build a little thing and then go and then use some hybrid.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 And then use some hybrid system, but like nobody needs all the shit to do what you've got to do and it's too hard to get.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 So there'll be some focus there.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 And that's kind of where I'm at too.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Like I, you know, picked up a few little utility things, but I don't need any oscillators.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 I don't need like a lot of shit anymore.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 I definitely don't need any more sequencers.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 You know, like I'm going to just chill for a minute and just use what I have.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 So do we have any other predictions for 2022?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 That was the only one I came up with.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 For, you know, just more people, you know, shifting from shifting directions rather like there seems to be a lot of people trying to go all modular, which even I was doing for a while.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 Now I'm kind of pulling that back, you know.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 I wonder too, like live shows have not come back and you know, we're going to be coming up on two years now of a lot of canceled shows.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 I wonder how much impact that's having on, you know, people's layout and what they're doing and what they're buying with, you know, no longer an eye for what I can use live, what I can drag around.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 I feel like, yeah, I feel like that ties in kind of with the prediction of 2022 is going to be a big push for hybrid environments and virtual environments.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 You know, for the same reasons, like manufacturers are starting to make virtual gear that you can use in VR to DJ or even do sound designers, does and since that you can use in VR now and you can do, you know, you can use those live in a VR show.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 What does it sound quality of like when you join something like that depends on your gear.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 You know, I mean, like I can route my audio output through my system in my studio, which I've done for some of the virtual events I've gone to, which is nice, you know, then I get my subwoofer going and everything and it's loud and in my face, but like most people I think just use whatever speakers or ear pieces are part of their headset, you know, like I have the Valve Index, which has a really good headset.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 You notice that company subpack to remember they make that wearable like subwoofer kind of thing.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 It seems like they're teasing some new piece of gear and I was like, Oh, I haven't thought about them for a while.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 I always wanted to try one of those, but never like did.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 And I wonder if they're not going to somewhat cater to that new demand for being in like some virtual show and having some better base response.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 They could do that cheaply.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 I could see people jump in on that.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 It's just funny though, because like, I mean, the numbers aren't lying. This does seem like this is true, but like, you know, given our ages, we've all been hearing this for since the early 90s.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 VR has been the future for 30 years now.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 It's funny that, you know, it does seem like it's kind of true, but it's hard not to have a skeptical eye towards like, are you sure it's actually going to be the future this time?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 Because I've heard this like a dozen times now.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 It's the pandemic, you know, that really made it take off.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 You know, I mean, it's what got me to finally dip into it. You know what I mean?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 Just being in lockdown and all that shit being bored.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 So you think the metrics might be different if we weren't all in lockdown?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Absolutely.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 You know, like, it's been a slow burn, slowly growing, like, you know, the index came out.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 When it came out, I think Valve predicted that it would sell 1 million units in the course of like a year or two.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 And it ended up selling that within, I think, three months or something like that.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 Like, they sold out and was backordered within the first few months of the pandemic.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 Like, everyone started jumping into VR and they had to ramp up manufacturing to meet that demand.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 And because of that rapid growth, we're seeing a bunch of like little, no-name companies coming up out of the word work

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 and like doing kick starters to fund like really interesting gear to augment the shit that, you know, people like Facebook and Valve are doing.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 You know, I mean, like, there's this company called Tundra now.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 They're offering these trackers that are like half the size, twice as much battery life,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 then like your standard trackers that you can get and things like that.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 So a lot more friendly for people that want to like have full body tracking and dancing and VR and shit.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Do you happen to know if they are related to the Tundra group, the AV group Tundra?

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 I don't think they relate to anything. I think this is the first product, basically.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 I remember that group though.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 I remember the name, but yeah, I don't think Tundra is even their name.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 I think Tundra is the name of the tracker. I forget what they're actually.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Got you. What that name is.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Tundra at Mutek a couple years ago.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Pre-pandemic. It was amazing.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Not to remain in this conversation, obviously, but.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 No, but I think to your question, Dave, I think this will be the thing where it persists kind of forever at this point.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 I think it's inevitable that some sort of reality like this will be overlaid on top of this reality.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Because I...

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Absolutely.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Especially in China, it seems to have more penetration than it does here.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 As far as like, oh, I hate the term, but like metaverse and like things like that where it's layered, like activities on top of this reality.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Because it just makes sense.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Right.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 That's sort of augmented reality.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Exactly.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 And let's say we're entering an augmented reality with 2022 for sure.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 2021 was like the first step on the moon, you know?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 And now we're like going to Mars, I think.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 Yeah, like it's going rapid, you know?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 I think we're going to see augmented reality shit coming from like big, big people like Samsung, Apple, things like that.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Seems like it's just things like we're catching up at this point.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Yeah.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 I think it's going to be a part of day-to-day life, not just gaming headsets.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 I think we're going to see augmented reality glasses coming, you know, things.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 So Google, Google Glass was basically like the new compared to cell phones.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Google Glass was just like the precursor is a little crude, maybe a little before it's time, but like you're going to see stuff like that.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 Come back.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 Yeah, it's going to be a mix of augmented reality and AI based applications doing things like, I mean, if you look on Instagram right now, you know, I mean, we're like TikTok.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 God forbid you're actually on TikTok, but you look at it like almost everything is altered by the internet.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 I mean, even your cell phone pictures at this point are a pale, sexy, and believe reality.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 There's so much, so much correction, so much AI, so much is being done and sort of modifying reality in real time.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Yeah, and I feel like that's going to jump this year into the next, to the point where you don't have to apply AI filters to your pictures anymore to make yourself look prettier or thinner or whatever.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 You're going to have glasses on your face that do it fucking for you automatically in real time, and everyone's just going to start accepting that as the norm.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Right.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 That's my optimistic cyberpunk dystopian opinion, you know, but it seems like it's going that way.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 I mean, you're also getting into some weird stuff like booty art and the simulation and copies and what is authentic and what is real and what's original and a lot of that's just going to stop being meaningful after a while.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 I think a lot of that has been like, you know, on the edge for a while, like we've all known it was coming and things like that.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 And there's been much philosophical debate about that sort of thing, but I think with the wide acceptance of VR and AI in our lives over the last two years during this pandemic, I think has opened the floodgates and it's not around the bend anymore.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 I think it's like, it's here, you know, and it's going to be coming out and chunks throughout 2022.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 I think there is a pretty serious problem though with you have to take everything with a grain of salt because this has potentially been modified and the discipline that comes with this new technology.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 I don't know.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 We're meeting it quite yet or have the capacity to meet it and the ability to like lie and convince and spread it misinformation for various means and profit, I think, is it's a it's scary real right now.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 We won't escape black mirror type realities. That's for sure.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 Yeah, I didn't want to take it down that stoping of the rally.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 I'm just talking about people putting on anime girl avatars and raves every week.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 You know what I mean?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 I'm sorry, I brought it down to everyone.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 That's what I do.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Yeah, let's get back to topping.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Big to the anime girls.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Virtual raves Dave. That's what the people want to hear about.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 I want that though. I want virtual raves. I want sweat and stink.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 I like both.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 And that's what I mean by augmented. I think the two worlds are going to collide.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Yeah, you know, the pandemic isn't going anywhere.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 As soon we're going to see augmented shows, you know what I mean?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 That are going to be happening simultaneously in reality with sweat and stink.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 And also in a virtual world that people can attend remotely.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 You know what I mean? It's going to be emerging of the two worlds in some fashion.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Yeah, why not? And gear that you can manipulate physically and virtually at the same time.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 You know what I mean? That's the type of stuff I'm looking forward to.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 So we've talked a lot about VR.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 Yeah, probably you're going to have to edit a grip of this out. Sorry for babbling.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 No, no, it's a super interesting topic.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 I don't even know how we got on VR. We were talking about all of it.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Yeah, the future shift.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 That brings us to the past also.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 Yes.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 2021.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 2021.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 We said we were going to talk about some of the highlights of that.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 Yeah.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 Yeah.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 I only have highlights. I only have highlights.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 I did not put low lights down.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 I think shit's been bad.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 You know, personally, globally, professionally, socially.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 Everything.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 Yeah. So I was like, you know what? I'm only bringing the posy.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 Posy youth, posy machine.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 Okay. We don't want to talk about.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Oh, no, no, no. That's just me.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 The disappointments? No, that's fine.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 If you guys have disappointments, I am perfectly willing to do it again.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 I only have one, but I can do without talking about, to be honest,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 because I do have a pretty extensive list of shit that is on the up and up.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 How about for some good criticism, though?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 I want to hear what you think is disappointing.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 I've won that.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 It's kind of like on the fence, but not really.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 I also don't know if I could let this go.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Like, I'm really curious as to what they are now.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 What these negatives are. So I say, go for it.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 Well, let's start with the positives.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 I had some highlights.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 One highlight was I built nine modules in 2021.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 That was a real record.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 Nice.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Yeah. I just realized that I like keep track of it because I don't know.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 I'm bored anal.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 But I was like, yeah, I built like a bunch of stuff and liked pretty much all of them.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 So that was cool.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Learned a lot about DIY this year.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 More so than before.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 And then I listed some modules that I thought were cool because I had to think too, like,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 oh, some of the stuff that I like was not didn't come out last year.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 I'm like deviating away from time in some regards with what stuff I like, I think a little bit.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 But new things would be 860 Mark II.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 I think that was this year.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 It's hard to tell because I think that might have been announced before and just wasn't released until last year.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 But the system 8860.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 And the Danny sound multi mode ladder because that came out in 2021 was only DIY.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 So you couldn't buy assembled ones.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Those two filters and that the piston Mark III, I don't think came out last year.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 I think that was out.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 No, this one I've heard a couple years actually, but it's just been hard to get.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Maybe 2019.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 It's been out.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 I think so.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Yeah.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 But that was new to me.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 It was pretty significant module.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 So.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Those were pretty cool.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 And the Danny sound I would say that started like this filter thing where I realized is a really good filter.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 It's the first like kind of mode kind of circuit I've ever had.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 And the overdrive is awesome.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 It sounds really good.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 And it kind of got me into like other older filters that are DIY like the G storm electros stuff like that.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 And it's a very good.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 XAVCF, which is a clone of the OB XA from Oberheim old poly synth using this old chip that was just reissued, which is why some people made this module.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 And it sounds sweet as fuck.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 It's a lot cheaper than other filters I have.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 And it kind of.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Not that it's a competition, but I would pick that every time over a filter that's much more expensive.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 So yeah, I was kind of psyched on that.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 I'm kind of psyched to have their delta filter on the way, which was from the poly 61 and the cork delta.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 Cork poly 61, which was my first synthesizer ever, which is super broken because of battery corrosion.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 So I get to hear that filter sound again, which I really liked.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 And actually be able to use it, which is something I always for years, I was thinking, oh, could I tear the filter out of the poly 61 somehow, but it's too complicated of a circuit.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 It's just it would I would have to design a product essentially to do that. And this person did that.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 So I'm psyched on it. And it's also super nice sound quality. Does it sound janky at all for someone that just has a reverb store.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 How was the builds?

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 Awesome.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 They're all surface. Well, the G storm stuff is surface mouth. The Danny sound kit was awesome. It was a lot of fun to put together. It took like four hours, probably, and was really well documented.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 Good calibration procedure. So I thought it was broken at first. And I just realized I was turning that little trim pots the wrong way, you know, like the 18 turn trimmers or whatever turned to the right, not the left.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 I heard like the filters close and I was able to actually dial it in and then it like totally opened up.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 It sounds crazy. The high pass is crazy.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 I love it. It sounds fucking great.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 That's the overheim one.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 Sorry, that Danny sound is the mode clone. They both sound awesome. And the other one from G storm of Actros, the overheim clone.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 And I was using both of them last night to process some piston sounds and some plats. And it was fucking doing it for me, especially the plats chords.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 Overheim OBXA is a poly synth. So it has a lot of mid range basiness to it and really like thick like full dub chord that like has a lot of motion to it and is not just some background thing.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 So I really like it. You can like whip sounds around. It's kind of hard to describe, but the way it kind of like melts around the sounds a little different than the Moog.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Resonance is very different. It's like very classic resonance on the overheim one. The Moog one's very sweet, but the overheim one almost you can like play like it was the jump synth, fan, hail and jump, which is not a sound like I'm fucking going for.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 But you can get like these super high resonance like sounds that sound like classic sci-fi movies almost. It's hard to describe.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Maybe I'll try to throw in like a sample of it here because I recorded a bunch of that shit last night. But it's real sweet. And with the effects aid reverbs, especially the black hole reverb clone, which is bloom or something like that on the effects aid, it was fucking.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Someone that shit was flipping me out last night. I got some really good recordings that I probably turned into a track. So that was fun.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Yeah, filters into like filters, collecting some filters over time that are less expensive, especially these like G storm of that show.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 How much did these run? The Delta filter was 130 bucks or something like that, not much. And the XAVCF was, I think it was, if I would have gotten it from him, it would have been 220, but I had to get it from Schneider's Layton.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 So it was like 240 something in the end, but still like I've paid more than that for filters and been way less satisfied. Again, like I wouldn't be able to get like that filter clone. So I'm glad they cloned it.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 Oberheim's not going to do it. They have like a SH5 and 101 clones. They're the ones that did the 101 clones that kind of look like a 101. You know, they have like red, blue ones.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Yeah, I wanted those really bad. I was going to build a whole voice out of those, but I don't know. It'd be a lot of space and I get it exactly. I started to calculate it and I was like, I don't need it. Yes, the quality is good.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 I'm not interested in the 101 either, just because the 101 is not like I have the SHO 1A. I like it. I never use it. I just don't lust for that as much.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 That was good shit in 2021 that I really dug. Those are the top ones. There was other stuff that I got last year, but a lot of it was from other years or isn't anything new, you know.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 Like rings. I just got rings. Rings is fucking incredible. I slept on that shit hardcore. That's an amazing module. It's maybe my favorite mutable module.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 It is. You have a ring? Oh, yeah. I had like three of them at one point. Okay, I thought that was...

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 I'm down to just one. You're the base from that thing is incredible. Like, I'm processing it. I love the input on it. It's fucking great.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 Not to plug my record, but I'm going to plug my record. Do it.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 The record that Thaco put out this year, the split with me and Spednar, you'll hear me abusing rings all over it. A lot of the base.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 A lot of percussion patches that I did, I would split off so that it would logically get routed through rings at times and then not at others and generate a lot of the sub base tones on that album, or mostly rings being manipulated in some way and handling sine waves going through it and resonating in tune with it.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 Finding weird tunings with it to go with the source and shit. Yeah, big fan of rings. I had a couple of them during the production of that record, but now I'm just down to one.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Rings into piston Honda external inputs into bionic cluster into effects aid though. Game fucking over. Yeah. Rings into the Honda inputs. There's some magic time.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 I miss the piston. Most of all for processing. Yeah. And I think I need to get one again for that because I miss it a lot.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 That is, I think, what I like the most about. I can see. I actually have a couple of little issues with mine. I don't know. Do you have the latest firmware?

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 I do not, but it's for some reason the tuning's been a little off, so I'm going to have to upgrade to see if that fixes some of my issues.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 But I can't even get like in link mode. If I turn both the tunings, one of them is always off and I have to have the fine tune like halfway set up for it to be correct.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Yeah. And that is new. I don't remember that. And then I noticed one of the sliders kind of turned off for a second the other day. I thought that was weird too.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 That might be hardware though. Yeah. I don't know what it is. It was the first time that showed up. Sounds good, Dale. It's definitely a game changer to turn the morphing off on that third bank for me.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 That lets you switch through the oscillator banks and everything like really came together. I really love it now.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 Yeah. It's on my list, even though it's not from 2021. I got it in 2021. So it's exciting to me. That's a 2021 thing. And I mean, at this point, it may replace my graphic VCO.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 The only thing graphic VCO has that this doesn't have is effects on wave tables, but I don't know if that warrants keeping both.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 I've just very, very slowly not been using graphic VCO now that I got the piston and Nick, as you pointed out, being able to set the presets in sync with the other of the Mark 3s and having the bionic Lester using the Harlequin's context to basically set up scenes and sort of more for switch between presets

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 and having the Lester and the piston as a scene that I can then switch to as I'm playing or recording is holy shit. That is super fucking nice.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 That shit works well too. I've got the piston, Lester, and Kermit all syncing pretty nicely when I want them to presets.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 I will also say, Greg has this to, I believe, so maybe you don't need more of the vortices from SSF.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 You still, yeah, you still have.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 Depending on the planet. Yeah, a lot right now, actually. I do like it. I like it a good bit.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 I would definitely not going to get rid of it. It does shave off a little more high than I expected your comment initially about not putting percussion through it. It's definitely, I have to pick the things that I want to put through it for sure.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 Right. It wasn't on my top pick list, but I'm definitely liking it. So definitely be on that list. Sure.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 Yeah, and it I don't even have a complaint really about how it muffles things. That's part of the character of it.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 True. That's kind of what it's supposed to do. It's supposed to be like a tape type of saturation slash mudging of the audio.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 So yeah, certain things I think sound really good through it. Others not so much. Some coming up with a way to route specific things through it.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 You know, and then others get routed through Cosmetronic Cosmix. Yeah, I love which I love the cos I think I think is a perfect percussion mixer.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 Yeah, I think it's my default for everything. I love it. Yeah, I could see having two of them chained, but I do like what the board of seas can let you do with feedback for sure.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 It's really nice for that. That is a big thing. Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 It's mainly what I use it for. So wait, have we talked about the vertices yet?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 Mm hmm. Do we want to give a little context for this?

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 Oh yeah, I guess we kind of it's solid state fate.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 Multi channel mixer that is meant to emulate tape to some degree and tape saturation.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 It's definitely not a transparent mixer. No. And it doesn't actually use real tape. This is an emulation of tape. No, yeah.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 Yes, just going through some sort of muddy preamps that, you know, affect the audio in a pleasurable way.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 In my opinion, and like Nick said, it feeds back like a motherfucker if you wanted to.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 Like you can do some really interesting feedback routing with it. And it sounds great. Like really sounds great.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 Yeah, and each like half is kind of muffled in a different way too. Like the mono and the stereo channels are a little different in how they respond to high end and things like that.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 Yeah, the auxiliary inputs have more high end than the main mono and stereo. Oh, is that it? Okay. Yeah.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 So like if you want something to be a little more, I don't want to say transparent because none of the inputs seem to be transparent to my ears.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 But less smudged use the auxiliary inputs. If you're going for that tape quality all the way, then use the main inputs for sure.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 Well, one gripe a little bit about it is I wish they'd kept all the level knobs, the same type of knob that threw me off so much at first.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 I was like, wait, and because the pan accidentally hit the pan. Yeah, actually, I do it constantly.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 And I just maybe it's just like they had space issues and I get it, but I wish it would have been.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 So what I did was I just changed the color knobs of the pan. I got to do that.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 I did the same thing on the Cosmix because I was doing the same thing on there.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 I did that too. Yeah, it comes in handy. You know, so now I have a visual reference.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 Yeah. Yeah, I put like knob, knob caps on the pan on the Cosmix.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 Yeah, so I stopped thinking it was the off. Exactly what I did.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 I love the Cosmix. I really love the sweetening circuit.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 Just the ability to overdrive. It's pretty. It's the best mixer in your rack up ever used for sure.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 I agree. And that's a hard one to beat because I really love my mutamix for years.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 True. It's dependent upon it. You know what I mean?

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 You had that for that.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 Yeah, this I think was the next best mixer that I've come across.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 Yeah, that was even that was on the negative pile.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 Quote unquote. Even though I really like that was the closest I could come to a negative.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 It's honestly I've been just really psyched. I can dip into my number one pick.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 Oh, yeah. It's kind of a biggie. Yeah. Have some words. What is it?

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 That would be V C V rack to.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 I was one. I was thinking it was going to be that of the the other one. Star lab.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 Star lab is my number two. Okay. I can get to that.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 I don't have as much to say about that as I do V C V. Yeah.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 Well, let's not forget about it then. So let's let's put a pin on it. Let's table it for now.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 And then. Well, circle back. Circle back.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 But yeah, my number one pick for 2021 is V C V rack version two.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 So you you talk you did a deep dive or pretty deep dive into V C V rack in the past.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 What is what's different into and how are you using it differently than you had say months ago.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 So version two isn't that much different. I would say like it's better performance.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 You can run it as a VST within a host now. Like you can open up in a DAW and route everything.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 Which is pretty cool. That part is not free. That costs money.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:04.000
 That's a hundred dollar fee to get access to that. They call that V C V rack to pro.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 So that's one of the most big changes. But like yeah, there was a bunch of like performance enhancements.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 A lot of the default V C V rack modules got some minor tweaks and changes which were all better in my opinion.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 Like it's just all around more solid. V C V one. I was enjoying noodling around in, but it wasn't like.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 It wasn't blowing my mind. You know, there was a lot of snags that I was hitting and performance problems and bugs that I would find.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 It just felt like it wasn't quite there yet. You know, but with version two, it feels there now.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 Like it's been a big game changer to me. It came out in early December, if I recall.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
 Maybe mid December like that. So it's just squeezing in for 2021.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 And it's not technically hardware, but I wanted to bring it up because of how I'm using it.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 Which is how I feel like a lot of people are going to be using it as well.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 And that's in a hybrid. We never specified hardware. This is just 2021. I mean, it could be anything.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 It could be hardware, software, ideas, concepts, feelings. It really is a pretty open-ended list.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 So don't feel bad about including this.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 I mean, I feel like it does a good enough job of emulating hardware that it's worth mentioning on our podcast.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 It's not software that's trying to be software. It's literally a virtual, your Iraq environment.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 And you're integrating it pretty heavily with your other hardware.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 Absolutely. I'm full-on hybrid set up now at this point.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 A couple months back when I was noodling in version one, started to get my attention.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 So I bought a expert sleepers ES8 to become the interface between VCV rack and my hardware modular.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 I outgrew that within weeks. I took to it very quickly and immediately wanted more inputs and outputs.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 So I expanded it with the ES5 expander module. And then that still wasn't enough either.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 So now I'm on an ES9 with an ES5.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 So I have a ton of inputs and outputs.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000
 I think I have 16 in 16 out now.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
 That's awesome.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 Yeah, it's pretty wild. And this is all as hybrid, you know, between my hardware and VCV rack.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 It's been an absolute miracle for my workflow.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 So what if you replace, what if you take an out and basically put on VCV rack?

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 So I wouldn't say there was a lot that I was taking out.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 It's more of I can finally grow the way I wanted to and I've been wanting to.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 Instead of taking out what is something that you would have maybe bought as a module.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 That now you're like, "Oh, I don't need to buy that. It doesn't need to be hardware anymore."

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 Lots of sequencing, a lot of utility. Like I was telling Nick before, I had three rings that I was using on the last album.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 And that was because I was running out of space and money.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 That whole album was an experiment to push all the modular stuff that I had as far as it could go within its limitations.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 You know, like I was out of rack space. I was out of money.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 And I was like, "Okay, let's just focus on what I have. See what type of, you know, algorithmic patches I can come up with and utilize everything."

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 And it was a fun limitation to work within.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 Now, though, I can take those ideas that I had for those patches and just really fucking run with them.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 Like if I want a dozen rings running at once now, I can do that.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 You know, and I don't need to worry about rack space. I don't need to worry about buying 12 rings.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 It's kind of phenomenal to me to be able to just grow.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 You know, the only limitation is my CPU.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 That's the only thing that holds me back at this point. But I can really just run with some of these concepts that I have.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 And just playing with this within the last month since it's released, like, in super productive, super fun.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 And, you know, it leaves space in my hardware rig now for the more boutique shit.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 You know what I mean? Like, I just got a star lab, for example.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 I mean, like, I have the space now to dedicate to modules that are, you know, more sexy, for lack of a better term.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 You know what I mean? The really crazy shit.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 Not like five switches.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 Well, I still have five switches.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 An array of five or six switches in my rig, but yeah, those are slowly coming out.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 Because I can do almost all my switching now within VCV.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 So it's things like that, like, just tons of utility that I can offload now to the virtual rig.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 And, you know what I mean? And leave the hardware rig for doing things that are not so easily duplicated virtually, like, you know, star lab and reverbs.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 Any type of processing, really.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 And even complex oscillators.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 Like, the basic oscillators in VCV are fine. And there are some complex ones too, but I'm not too happy with it.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 Yeah.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 Like, the sound quality, I think, is still, you know, leave something to be desegary.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 Yeah. Somebody else thinking about when you said you could have, you know, nine rings.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 Well, would that actually sound like what you would get if you had nine rings?

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 Or are you going to get this sort of weird, new, mutated version of that?

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 It's pretty close. It's close enough.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 Because as far as I'm aware, it's the same code.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 Yeah.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 You know what I mean? So the only thing that's different is your ADAC.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 You know what I mean? So the conversion is whatever, I guess.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
 You know what I mean?

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 Like, I know people haven't been that fond of some of the mutable stuff, how it sounds in the first place.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 You know what I mean? A lot of people think it sounds too digital, things like that.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 That's fine for me because I'm going for a very digital sound.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 So the differences between like my hardware rings and my virtual rings is negligible, you know?

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
 Like, I can live with it.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 But when it comes to like filtering and effects, I'm not too happy with the sonic capabilities of the VCP rack in that regard.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 There are a few cool effects, but not many.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 You know what I mean? Like, if you look at the effects in there, some of them are very basic.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 Some of them don't even have CV capabilities.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 Things like that.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 Are they model-off of existing modules or is it?

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 It's both.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 Okay.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 Like, so, you know, version one has been out for a while.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 So there's been a lot of people making modules already.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000
 They had to convert them to be capable in VCP2.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 Like, everyone had to port them over. It wasn't a seamless transition.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 So people have been cranking stuff out for VCP for a minute now.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:43.000
 And sort of like the VST boom of like the early 2000s, where everyone was just cranking out plugins to do, you know, the same thing.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 You know what I mean? Like, every little thing you could think of, there was a lot of overlap and a mountain of shit.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 There's kind of a mountain of shit in VCP as well.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 There's a lot of crap you got to sift through to find the Golden Nuggets, in my opinion.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 Yeah.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 Like, there's a lot of modules that people are cranking out that just aren't...

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 They're either overlapping stuff that already exists way too much.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 Like, right now if you punch in envelope generator, I think there's close to 100 results.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:26.000
 You know? Like, no joke. I think there's like over 80 to 100 of envelopes.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 And it's like, okay.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 Totally necessary.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 I mean, options are good, sure.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 But when you have an oversaturation, when you're trying to get shit done, you know, and you just want to pop in an envelope generator, and you hit that tag envelope generator, and you're presented 100 fucking results, it gets to be overwhelming sort of like VSTs were to me.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 Which used to really turn me off to, you know, using them for a while.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:02.000
 But if you stick to the modules that are modeled after hardware, those are the ones that I think are the best so far.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000
 Like, those are the ones that are staying true to like modular aesthetic.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:15.000
 You know what I mean? They're not just shitty VSTs that someone ported over to fit in a 3U virtual workspace.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:20.000
 Also, I feel like a lot of the default VCD modules are pretty good.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:27.000
 You know what I mean? Like, you can get by using a lot of stuff and none of the third party stuff.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000
 Like, it's pretty solid.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:36.000
 That's all I've been using so far. I haven't put too many hours in, but I haven't even logged into it so I can't get the mutable stuff.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
 But yeah, it's not bad.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.000
 Like you said, the oscillators and the filters are kind of lacking a little bit.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
 They are. Yeah.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 That's where the hybrid situation comes in the way.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000
 You know what I mean? Like, I can just route them through my hardware, filters, and then back into VCD.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
 No problem there.

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:01.000
 Also, a lot of the stuff that I think is on the crap side of stuff.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:09.000
 Like, I keep making the comparison to VSTs because that's what a lot of these feel like they are or are coming from or trying to be.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
 Like, that I think is against the whole grain of what VCD is supposed to be.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
 You know, it's literally meant to be a virtual modular rack.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:27.000
 It's not meant to be another DAW or another host for, you know, whatever random effects people created.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
 Like, it's supposed to stick true to emulating a hardware modular.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
 There's some modules that are doing that that are innovative and new.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
 And there's some that are doing that by emulating already existing hardware.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
 But then there's some that are not at all.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000
 And like, just the panel is just crammed with, you know, teeny, tiny knobs that do a million different things.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
 Like, it's not something that you would ever see existing as a module in a real rack, you know?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
 And that's the shit that's kind of frustrating.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000
 Or they have tons of functionality that's embedded within a right-click menu subset.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
 You know, and things like that.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
 It's like, no, I don't want that.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
 That's why I went to modules in the first place.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
 And I definitely don't want it in my virtual rig either.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
 Some of the best...

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:24.000
 Well, I shouldn't say manufacturers, but I guess some of the best designers that I've come across are Valley,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
 Bog Audio, and Extra Tone.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
 They've all made some pretty nifty stuff that I've been using heavily now.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
 And I think it's a nice...

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:41.000
 Along with like the audible instrument stuff, which is all mutable ports and things like that.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
 So yeah, it's been a huge game changer.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000
 So you don't deal with like too much latency stuff dealing with like processing trips in and out.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
 Or you just account for it other ways.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.000
 Going in a loop through, you know, the modular back end, I have noticed hardly any latency.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:06.000
 Oh, cool. However, if you start to use some of the effects in there, that's where the latency is coming from.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
 Yeah, I guess I could dip into some of the bad things I've noticed about VCB.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
 Yeah. I'm kind of hyping it up, but it's definitely not like all butterflies and rainbows.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
 Like there's definitely some bullshit that you have to deal with as well.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000
 You know, even in VCB, rack two, I've still already found my fair share of bugs and random CPU.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:35.000
 Some certain modules, random audio dropouts, things not working as they should.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
 Like reset and clock, just getting wonky from time to time.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:49.000
 Like even if I route the same reset to all modules, they won't always be synchronized when I hit run on like the main clock and things like that.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
 Sometimes things are off.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
 Yeah, it's really weird because I don't know what is causing it.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
 It has to be something in specific modules coding.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
 Some of them are just kind of flaky in that regard.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
 And I have to do like the old school MIDI trick where you just like stop, start, stop, start until everything synchronized.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
 It's like, okay, now I'm in sync.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
 Give me a restart.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
 There's definitely some bugs.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
 Hopefully they get ironed out over time.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
 I know a lot of people have been constantly rolling out updates already since the release of VCB2.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
 Like every time I open it, I have to restart it to apply updates to either modules or to VCB itself.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
 So are the updates to modules individual?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
 Do you update them separately or do you update?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
 Okay, so it's not like you have to get everything from VCB rack to get the updated modules.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
 It's all done in the background.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.000
 Like whatever modules you have installed to your library, if an update becomes available, it'll notify you in the top.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:53.000
 It'll say like, such and such module has been updated and you have to restart VCB to apply that update.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
 Right.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.000
 Like even initially, none of the Instruo stuff, which was available in VCB1, was available in VCB2 until like last week.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000
 They finally finished porting it all over and made it all available in version 2.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
 Do you fuck with that shit at all? The Instruo stuff?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:18.000
 A little bit. Some of it, I would really like to see their R-Bar granular in there.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:28.000
 I don't know, but it's not. But they have like some interesting shit, like their complex oscillator and some of their utilities, which have been nice.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
 And that kind of ties in with what we were saying earlier.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:41.000
 I have a feeling a lot of companies who can't do the component shortages or whatever release a module or like an idea that they had.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:49.000
 Right now as hardware might start doing it in VCB rack, you know, and like might bring the concept over and release it as a virtual module.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
 Because it's not all free either. Some of them are paid for.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000
 So if someone had a cool design and they still wanted to make some money off of it, they can release it that way.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:09.000
 I would love to see more of the big names in the modular world embrace VCB and bring some of their stuff over either for free or for pay, you know, either way.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:17.000
 Yeah, because they're not in VCB, but noise engineering was one of the first to kind of embrace like, here's a virtual version of our stuff.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:26.000
 And they've even made a physical module now, I think because one of the virtual ones was so popular, like one of the versios that they were like, oh, we'll make a panel for it and sell it, kind of thing.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
 But it's almost a shame they're not kind of in VCB too.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
 Yeah, that's my number one pick.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:47.000
 I don't have a whole lot more to say about it now, but I did want to give a shout out to, I'm probably going to mispronounce his name, but Omri Cohen, the gentleman that we were watching that livestream of the guy.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
 Oh, yeah.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
 Did the VCB like, thank you livestream?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
 Yeah, he did the livestream for VCB to the O-coast.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
 And it was the O-coast.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
 The O-coast.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
 Yes, we thought we would.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:07.000
 Like, since that night, I've been watching more of his livestreams and his YouTube videos.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
 Super informative, incredibly chill dude.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
 Kind of hard to understand what he's saying sometimes, but it's okay, you know.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:24.000
 And his stuff leans heavily onto like the ambient side of things, which isn't always, you know, my cup of tea, but

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 he gives you a good map through some of the crap modules that I was talking about and points out which ones he uses often and why.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
 Super useful, you know, especially to anyone who's just getting into it.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.000
 Like, you can just pretty much stick to some of the example modules that he's shown off and you'll go far with them.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:59.000
 You know, I mean, you don't have to wade through all the shit I've been doing testing and testing and figuring out which ones are good for me, which ones I hate.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
 That's why I just asked you, I was like, what should I get?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
 You're like the bog audio shit.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
 Yeah, cool.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
 But yeah, everything leading up to this kind of felt like a beta.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000
 Like version two finally feels like, you know, the real deal.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:22.000
 It's like when, what you call it, audio mulch, you know, was like, finally one point zero.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
 Yeah, finally one point zero and it just felt cohesive.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
 It's kind of where we're at with VCP two.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
 It kind of feels like it's out of beta stage for the most part.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:38.000
 It feels solid, solid enough, at least for me to center my entire workflow around it right now and try to make an album with it.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
 How about you Dave?

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
 Yeah, Dave.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
 What about me?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
 What about me?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
 What's, do you have a top pick of twenty?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
 I don't have a top pick.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
 My list is, I've got a list, but I can't.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
 This is the top of the list.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000
 Well, once it's okay, I guess maybe, maybe subconsciously I made a, this list in a particular order.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
 So yeah, I just got through it.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
 Some of them are more detailed than others.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:09.000
 I do have, we've already talked about the piston Honda and the fact that it wasn't actually 2021, but me getting it.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
 It's fantastic.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
 Also, I wanted to say, Polly and Tracker.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
 I'm glad I got one.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
 I think they nailed the design.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
 And my complaint about it is actually not related to it.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
 It is more about my damaged brain.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
 One of the things I'm finding is I'm basically just going back to old habits.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000
 And I'm not really necessarily making that music that I made, you know, ten, fifteen, twenty years ago.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
 But I'm sitting down and I'm just like, you know, cranking up the speed, filling in every note.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:50.000
 I'm like, oh, like, I'm having a hard time restraining myself and like leaving empty space and music is the space between notes.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
 And it's like, no, no, there's an empty block.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
 It should be filled with something.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:03.000
 So it's really just more of like, man, I really need to take a look as to why my brain does that.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
 But as far as the design goes and execution, Polly and Tracker's amazing.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
 I think they, that was a slam dunk.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
 I think it deserves to be behind the list.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000
 Even if it was 2020 officially came out, I'm fine with including in 2021.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
 Up next though, and this might, I have a lot more notes about this.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
 This is a video module.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
 I got the LZX FKG3 Keyer.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
 It's a keyer module.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
 It is fantastic.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000
 It is RGB for foreground, background, and a completely tertiary input.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:48.000
 You can swap back and forth between background foreground and you can key off of Luma or any of the RGB values.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
 There's a threshold and a softness that is nice.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
 It's not just, it's not just a hard cure.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
 And those are CVable.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
 You know, I have a memory palace, but that was, you know, from a while ago.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000
 I'm sort of feeling that this is the first of that new generation of LZX modules.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
 It is.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
 You know, if they're going to keep going down this path, putting a lot of functionality into a single module like this,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
 I think it's great.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000
 And I'm really looking forward to their, the TBC2, the time-based correction module,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.000
 which is like dual sync with Gen Lock, time-based correction, format conversions for a lot of different ones.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.000
 And there's a, there's a, an image loader on it that I don't know if it's going to be like the memory palace or what,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
 you know, how, how it's actually going to end up being used.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
 But I'm really looking forward to that one.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.000
 But the problem is, and this goes back to what we talked about earlier, is this generation of stuff is taking a lot longer than they expected

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
 to actually come to, like, to show up in production.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
 Really taking a long time.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000
 And one of the problems that's happened is there's now a gap because they discontinued the previous generation of stuff.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000
 And this, you know, a lot of this is going to replace it or not, maybe not one for one module by module,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
 but you were going to, you know, basically we're not making the old stuff.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
 So, but here's this new thing that's right around the corner.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
 Well, the corner's turned out to be, you know, 20 blocks long.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
 And so right now we're in a really weird space where you can't get the old stuff from them.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
 And the new stuff is, it's TBD.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:26.000
 So, getting anything right now off of Reverb is really out of control.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
 Yeah, it's nuts.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
 Yeah, and, I mean, structure's the same way.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
 The second-hand market for structure from Arogenous Tones is the prices are through the roof.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:43.000
 But this is basically the worst time to get into modular video, just because you're between generations and no one knows when the next generation is going to be done.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000
 I'd be sad to hear that someone was discouraged from getting into it because it was already kind of video modular,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
 it was already like a little bit of a, it's an expensive thing to get into.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
 And now it's like, oh, yeah, no, it's three times as much as what it was in the past.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
 So that's a little bit of a bummer.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:12.000
 But if this FKG here is any indication as to what they're eventually going to be putting out, very, very excited for LZX, what they're doing.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
 That's the one I had the most notes on.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:24.000
 Next, and we don't have to really negate this, but Erika Matrix Mixer, I just think they nailed the design, and I think it's worth mentioning again.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
 I'm not the point where I'm using it all the time.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:35.000
 I'm using, even just being able to go through presets and using that as a way to sort of control going through a song and going through a composition.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:44.000
 It just opens up a million possibilities that would be very, very difficult to organize without being able to have everything plugged in.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:52.000
 And then you pick and choose and do these combinations and this routing on the fly and being able to switch between it.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:59.000
 It's changing the way that I'm using things just because of how easy it is to set up a preset and make 256 of them.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:11.000
 And organize them in a way that as I'm going through a song and I'm going through different Matrix Mixer patterns and scenes, and switching between them is seamless.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
 There's no clicking, there's nothing weird about it that would prohibit it.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.000
 The more amusing it, the more I like it and the more I appreciate how well they executed it.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
 And I'm going to say the same thing about the Harlequin's context.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000
 I think maybe one of my complaints, maybe I don't even know if we necessarily talked about it, but they overtook it.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
 Yeah, we talked about that estimate.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
 Yeah.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:43.000
 And basically now that I'm like, you know what, I'm just ignoring this weird scene and act morphing thing and really just using it how I want to use it and getting comfortable with it.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:58.000
 Very similar as far as having this setup, having all this patching done and giving it motion over time, not just through modulation, but changing what the modulation is over time.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000
 Really rocking the Harlequin's context and the Matrix Mixer together.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
 It's really just making things the one more fun.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
 Yeah.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:15.000
 Interesting, because I'll in a way piggyback off your last two, because I have them both like Harlequin's context at first. I was like, "Oh, only ever use this live."

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000
 But now I use it constantly when I'm patching. I was using it a lot last night to like change chords and stuff like that.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
 I'm always thinking of new ways to use it simply for the offsets.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
 I will say the Erica Matrix Mixer, I never ever use it.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
 Ever.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
 Really?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
 Wow.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:40.000
 If you like it, I never makes its way into me doing stuff.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
 I don't know.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
 I don't know what it is about.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.000
 I don't, I don't, I realize I kind of don't think of things in that way and I don't often want to reach for it.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:55.000
 Because in my mind when I'm like, "Oh, it's this big buffered molt that I can use to send various versions of signals out and that's cool."

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000
 And maybe it's because it's like, it doesn't sit well on my desk with the other things that I have right now.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000
 But it's often sitting there not even on and I'm like questioning why I have it.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
 Even though I know like, I love it in theory, I don't use it ever.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
 No, interesting.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
 Yeah.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:20.000
 I feel like the little bit that I've looked up, it does seem like there is a little bit of, not love hate isn't the right word, but more of online.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.000
 Like whatever the equivalent binary of a use this all the time and it's sitting there, it seems to be the case.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
 There doesn't seem to be a middle ground with this.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
 Yeah.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
 It's strange.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:40.000
 Even though I'm always using buffered bolts and I always need more, there's something about it where it's like an external system.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
 And part of me wishes it was in the rack magically.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
 I don't know.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
 It's just kind of a mental thing.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000
 That is a perfectly fair review of it.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
 So, and the only other things on my list, Mosqua?

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
 Killer.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
 That's 2021 I think.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
 For us it is at least.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
 I think it might have been.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
 It was close enough that I'm fine with including this list.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
 I'm now at the point where I'm thinking of getting a second one and linking it.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
 It's so fucking good.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
 I really, I think there was even a podcast where I was like, "Oh, I'm not using this this much.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
 I use it constantly now.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
 Like it's, I love it."

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
 All the CV options, the range function and transposition at the same time.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000
 You can do like, I'm constantly making these little melody machines with that in the performer now.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
 That's like so much fun for me.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
 I can't imagine not having the expander.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
 I think the expander is absolutely key to getting the most out of it.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
 Otherwise I think you just have an eight step sequencer that's probably kind of boring.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
 Definitely.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000
 Having the expander adding modulation to everything and all these different dimensions and really

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
 the idea of having a second one and linking them and turning that into 16 steps or having

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
 them basically on each of them on their own is really appealing.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
 That's chaos devices really.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
 Yeah.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
 Yeah.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
 Yeah.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
 Mosquo.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
 Yeah.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
 Is that the version two?

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
 It is version two.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
 Yeah.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
 I forgot to append the two.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
 Same with the expander.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
 Same with the most in key.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
 We mentioned it before.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
 I never even had the first one.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
 I don't know enough about the first one to compare it.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
 I don't know if it's a massive upgrade or?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
 Yeah.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
 There's a lot more features and functionality and the ability to save presets and things like that.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
 I don't even know if the sub steps existed.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
 I don't use that as often.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000
 But it's even like I got it in the metropolis at relatively similar period of time when I

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
 was trying to expand sequencing.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
 I still have ignored the tropolics in some ways because of the Mosquo.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
 It's just that in the performer is such a fun combo.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
 Even though I was using the metropolis recently, just to dig into that a little more, it's

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
 cool too.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
 I like them all quite a bit.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
 Nice.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
 And honestly, the last thing on my list, I sort of rattled through all of these.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
 And it's a weird one, but I want to give it.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
 It was done well enough that I kind of want to give them a little bit of attention.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
 Black hole case cases.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
 I don't know if I mentioned this in the past.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
 It's a small company from Dayton, Ohio.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
 I just sort of found them all being lazy and not wanting to build my own case.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
 Super well built.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
 And they've got this sort of like textured finish to it.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
 And the color schemes that they have, everything looks like 1950s scientific equipment.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000
 Like it's just like this weird scientific blue is olive green.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000
 And even their logo is like an atomic symbol.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
 The aesthetic absolutely love.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
 And the price was decent.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:45.000
 I got the 6U50HP, which you know, since I was never going to be able to find one of those

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
 Pittsburgh structures of that similar size.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
 Yeah, I broke down and got it.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
 They're not local.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
 Dayton's not local, but you know, rust belt.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
 Rust belt.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
 A little rust belt.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
 City.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
 Ooh, Ohio.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
 Yeah.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
 Yeah.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
 I mean, there's a lot to say about Ohio.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
 There is.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
 I heard a rumor about the new Pittsburgh voltage lab.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
 The second one.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.000
 It is apparently two rows of 91 HP.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
 What?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
 That is a big module.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000
 So it's like a full synthesizer, like even more so than the original voltage lab.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000
 Yeah, that's almost that is more than twice the size of the original, which I'm.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
 I still like a lot.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
 I use the original voltage lab quite a bit, just the synth portion, as I've said before,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000
 and it's fucking dope.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
 So I'm curious to see what they come up with here.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000
 So the only inside scoop that you've got is its mammoth size.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
 Yep, that's it so far.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
 Try to do a little digging at one point, but I didn't get much back.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
 Well, what was your tactic for digging?

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
 Was it espionage?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
 Was it reusing the power of your persuasion?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
 Were you?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
 Just Twitter DM's Dave.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.000
 That's gotten me surprisingly far in some instances.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:12.000
 But no, I saw they were doing some podcast or something recently and they leaked that it

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000
 was going to be a 91 HP wide, which is that was my first mono rocket case was two rows

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
 of 91 HP.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
 That's pretty big.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
 My first mono rocket was a fucking Lexington.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
 Oh, that's right.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
 That white Lexington.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
 Oh, yeah.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
 That was Prometheus burning white.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
 Yeah, it was.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
 Or Prometheus white.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
 Prometheus white.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
 No one had requested that before, so he named the color after us.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
 That was, uh, I missed that case.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
 Yeah, that was a pretty case.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
 I totally forgot about that.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
 Kind of wish I could snap my fingers and you had it again.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
 Oh, and you have all those white cables now?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
 Oh, that would be very winter wonderland.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
 You're right.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
 You look sad.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
 I miss it, dude.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
 I'm glad to know it went to a good home.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:02.000
 Somebody in Ohio, I forget who now, but yeah, that was, that was my pride and joy for a

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
 few years there.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.360
 Well, I have a number two pick.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.200
 Wait, we just completely skipped.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:11.200
 Like we went from number one and then just left entirely.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.120
 I figured we were going to go around and around, dude.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.600
 I gave my number one pick.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.520
 Oh, so I like when you were in this format.

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:19.000
 I just like didn't stop.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
 You did.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
 You're going off script.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
 You're a fucking runaway train.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
 But it's okay.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
 I swear.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
 Oh, we could probably.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
 Is there, is there nothing I can't fuck up?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
 Somebody doesn't look at the spreadsheet.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
 What spreadsheet?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
 I mean, we got a spreadsheet.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
 It's all right.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
 The spreadsheet, Dave.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
 A spreadsheet that we use to keep track of topics, Dave, for the episode.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
 That's okay.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
 We'll circle back in your next performance review.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
 You didn't share that with me.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
 And review that.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
 I didn't, I did not get notified.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
 Oh, man.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
 No, it's fine.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
 We're doing it live, dude.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
 It's free jazz.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
 It's right.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
 You could have jumped in and said, "You don't want, dude.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
 You need to shut up."

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
 You're lifted too long.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
 You're taking too long.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
 It's a stand up, so it's be five minutes.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
 No.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
 It didn't matter to me.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000
 I just, I like giving things in order.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
 I picked three.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
 And I figured we'd go around.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
 Well, not that I've, I mean, we can't go back.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
 We can't go back.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
 The damage is done.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
 And there's no recovering.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
 I kind of fucked up, too.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
 I just said everything, too.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
 So it's fine.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
 Fuck it.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
 All right.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
 Well, Greg, the floor is now yours again.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
 Number two pick.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
 Twenty, twenty-one.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
 Strime and Starlob.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
 Not surprising.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
 No.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
 Yeah.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
 I knew that was kind of predictable.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
 It was so predictable that I couldn't even make it number one.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
 As much as I enjoy it.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
 I was like, that's like low hanging fruit.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
 So is there anything that you don't like about it at this point?

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
 I thought I don't like about it.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
 That's more interesting.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
 Yeah.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
 Lack of algorithms.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:08.000
 There's only three main algorithms that select from, and they all kind of overlap a little,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
 in my opinion.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:19.000
 I would have liked more algorithms to pick from and have them more different between the other ones.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:27.000
 I feel like these three that it comes with are a great tool set, those three.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
 It would be cool to be able to go beyond that.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
 Have some like, weirder, darker reverbs in there.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:39.000
 I mean, just a couple, just more variants.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:47.000
 Because of that, I would not say that the Star Lab is like the end all be all of modular reverb.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:58.000
 It's just, it's not, you know, like, but it does what it does very well within those, within the realm of those three algorithms, you know.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
 It sounds great to my ears.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:08.000
 The three algorithms that you do have though, you can get very flexible with, which is one reason why this has become like,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:17.000
 my go to over halls of a holocart in ZDSP, which has been my favorite reverb for years now.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:29.000
 This, I think, kind of beats it now, finally, simply because of the flexibility, the ability to CV control so many different aspects of each algorithm.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
 Whereas with the ZDSP, you only have three.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
 It's like literally surrounded with CV.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
 Yeah.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.000
 It's definitely not a set it and forget it reverb.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000
 Like, I feel like if you're doing that with it, you shouldn't bother.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
 Right.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:51.000
 Like, you should probably get one of their pedals instead, which is cheaper and probably more specific to your needs.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000
 Like, I don't know, like, that's one reason why the ZDSP was always so annoying to me.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000
 Like, as much as I love the sounds of halls of a holocart, you only have three parameters to control.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
 Right.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:09.000
 And that's why I kept herb-verb in my rack for years and years now because of its CV capabilities.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000
 Again, not to talk too much about my own work in the middle of the episode, but on that album, like,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:21.000
 there was a lot of sounds I created by CVing the fuck out of like, herb-verb, you know, like,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000
 using it not necessarily as just a straight up reverb, but as like, its own instrument, you know,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
 and hitting it with tons of CV and sequences.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.000
 I mean, it's not the type of thing where you just want to turn up the decay and leave it go.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
 Right.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
 I mean, it sounds good if you do that, but you're missing out on, I think, the entire point of the module.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.000
 So I've seen a lot of videos, or all the videos I've seen of it, really people are emphasizing it crank to 11.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:55.000
 The sort of lush, written it, richness, and those are like three modes, but can you do things like this sort of like, a short, quick?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
 100%.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:06.000
 My go-to lately has actually been on, I think, its tightest size setting and the decay on the smaller side.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:19.000
 I've been finding ways to get kind of like a degraded tape sound out of it by keeping it short and manipulating, you know,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:27.000
 the size and also the delay, you know, circuit that's in there and shit like that, hitting at it just the right times.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000
 I haven't fucked with the carpla strong functionality too much.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000
 I've just been using the delay itself, but hitting it with CV and things like that.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:44.000
 And I've said this in the past when it comes to delays too, like, or not delays, but reverbs rather,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:52.000
 that I'm not a huge fan of shimmer, you know, like I love the halls of a hollow card, did not really like shimmer card.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:27:01.000
 Loved the noise engineering reverb that I'm forgetting the name of now, but I can't remember.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
 I can't either.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
 The bat verb, I'll say that, I don't think that's the name of it, but it was the bat verb, you know, I mean,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000
 it had a couple different modes and one of them was shimmer, pretty much never touched the shimmer mode.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:18.000
 Like, I'm not a huge shimmer fan, so I really like the fact that you can actually bring that in and out of this with each algorithm if you want.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:30.000
 It's not like you're not locked into shimmer mode, you know, I mean, you can scale that back if you want, remove it entirely or CV it, whatever, you know, it's really interesting module to me.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:40.000
 Like, yes, it's big and pricey, but, you know, it stands out to me over pedals simply for its, you know, versatility.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
 Really digging on it.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
 Good for experimenting, good for sound design.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
 And cool, just as like its own instrument, you know, it even has like a resonator mode.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
 It could be standalone voice if you want it to be, which is weird.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
 I haven't really used it in that way yet, but yeah, you can do that.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
 Wait, would it trap?

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
 I don't know.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:08.000
 I mean, I think that's part of it has pitch quantization built into it that you can manipulate.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
 You can actually change the scale.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
 That's cool.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
 It's kind of an under the hood setting.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000
 If you hold in the size button or the button rather, it's next to size.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
 It's the infinite button.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:30.000
 I think you can turn it into, you can use that and the size knob to manipulate scales and pitch quantization and things like that.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
 So you can do a lot of weird shit with it.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
 It's very, very musical.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:44.000
 But yeah, you can totally do a cranked up to 11, you know, ambient wash for all infinity if you want.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
 And it sounds good.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:52.000
 In some ways, I feel like Halls of Valhalla sounded better in that regard, honestly, for really big stuff.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
 Well, they also had eight different algorithms.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
 Yeah.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
 So I think that having a larger variety of stuff probably helped that.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.000
 Which speaks a lot to that cart still, you know, in my opinion, like with only three parameters that you can manipulate.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
 You can get some really great sounding big stuff out of that cart.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.000
 But yeah, like with this module, you can do that.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:22.000
 But like, I think it really shines with evolving changing reverbs, not necessarily just big reverbs, but like complex manipulated sounds.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
 Yeah.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
 And that's my number two pick.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
 Very nice.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
 Nick, what was your number two?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
 Or did you already go through it?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
 I already went through everything just like you.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
 So Greg.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
 What's my number three?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
 That is very much my next question.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
 Okay.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
 It's kind of a tie.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
 So this is three and four is what you're saying.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
 Yeah, I couldn't pick.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:49.000
 So one is more interesting than the other, but I still wanted to give it an honorable mention at least.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:59.000
 I would say it leans more towards the SSF triptych or solid state fate triptych, which I mentioned a lot in the past.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
 Originally, that was a module that I had like no interest in.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:15.000
 Like, I felt like I already had enough distortion, enough filters, enough delay modules that I didn't see the need to buy a module that was like all through those sandwiched into one.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
 Yeah.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
 But, you know, and the demos didn't really blow me away by it either.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
 Like from what I heard, I was like, meh.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:29.000
 But I took a leap and I bought it and slowly over time it has really grown on me.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:35.000
 And now I find it in like pretty much all of my patches constantly in some degree.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
 You know what I mean?

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:47.000
 Like if I'm not using all three circuits on it, I'm using maybe just the car plus mode or maybe I'm just using the overdrive mode, you know, or just the filter, like whatever.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
 It's kind of like a fuck shit up module Swiss Army knife.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
 I'm always able to get something out of it that I like.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:00.000
 And I think that's what's special about it is all three of those things together kind of makes it unique and they all jive with each other.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
 It's really well done and thought out, you know.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
 So what's an example of how you use it?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
 Basically for people who aren't super familiar with what it can do?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:17.000
 Well, it's an overdrive circuit with wave shaper and carpless slash delay that you can adjust the mix in between.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:22.000
 And then it all gets routed through a filter either pre or post.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
 And it also has a VCA built in for the output.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
 Pretty nice headroom and overdrive on the input.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:39.000
 So you're getting saturation and distortion and like just destructive qualities from a number of different ways, you know, with them all combined.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:47.000
 I've been using it mostly in just like helping to create texture on like percussion.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:53.000
 I've mentioned in previous episodes that I find it a bit muddy in some ways.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:01.000
 So I don't like to run it like 100% wet, but like as a layer on top of certain percussive elements.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
 I really enjoy it.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.000
 Glitchy percussion stuff going through it can be a lot of fun.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:16.000
 And just to add some beef to like just strange textures that I'm creating, you know what I mean?

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
 Like, I don't know.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
 I always find weird ways to use it.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
 Find its way in there somehow.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:29.000
 Honorable mention for third pick slash fourth pick would go to the.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
 Shit.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
 Drawing blank.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
 Cause I didn't even jot it down.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000
 Dual dagger.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
 I. Yeah.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
 Yeah.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
 Yeah.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
 Jack Matt.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
 Dual dagger.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
 Stereo filter.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
 Love it.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000
 It's I wanted a compact stereo filter that wasn't like super expensive.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
 And there's not a whole lot out there.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:58.000
 For some reason in that regard, like either it's a DJ style filter or it's like, you know, shit.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
 What is the one that like make noise makes?

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
 Cue pass.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
 Do yes.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
 Thank you.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000
 Like they're gigantic and expensive and not what I needed.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:14.000
 Like I just wanted something to be able to, you know, filter a pad.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
 You know what I mean?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:20.000
 Like in a musical way, like following like distortion and reverb or something like that.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000
 Or to filter the output of clouds or something like that.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
 You know what I mean?

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.660
 It's like a six shit that I didn't need a $500 huge stereo filter to do.

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:33.660
 You know what I mean?

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:34.660
 This thing is eight HP.

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:37.040
 Actually, it might even be less than eight.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.400
 It might even be six.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.280
 I forget, but it's small.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.280
 Is it multi mode?

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.280
 Yes.

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:46.440
 It has a high pass and a low pass that you can blend in between and you can adjust the

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:55.200
 cut off of or you can even flip the mode and adjust both to be a variable band pass.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:56.760
 And it sounds great.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:58.680
 And you know, it's just, I don't know.

01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.680
 It does not.

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.800
 That's why it was kind of like an honorable mention because it's not that elaborate of

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:03.800
 module.

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:05.960
 There's not a whole lot of bells and whistles going on there.

01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:09.640
 But for the size and the price, super useful to me.

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:14.720
 Like I keep finding a lot of use for it, you know, because I'm doing a lot more of a

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:15.720
 stereo these days.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:20.160
 In fact, that's one of my only complaints about the trip tick is I feel like that would

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:26.280
 be world's more useful to me even more than it is currently if it was stereo, you know,

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.200
 like that would be amazing.

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:33.920
 But for whatever reason, they stuck with mono, but I think Shaq Matt's killing it actually.

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.160
 Like I really like their stuff.

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.160
 This is my first model.

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.480
 Their designs are interesting.

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:43.320
 Like the I have that time apprentice coming on the way the clock divider, but the

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.920
 consequence context is pretty awesome.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:46.920
 Yeah.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.400
 Oh, yeah, that is from.

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:49.400
 Yeah.

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:52.000
 And they generally have everything is DIY to.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.840
 Yeah, they're pretty cool.

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:54.840
 I like what they're doing.

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.360
 Well, it seems like they're a little under the radar.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:01.040
 I mean, I pay attention to what they're doing and I did not notice that stereo filter.

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.040
 I didn't either.

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.040
 It took me took a lot of digging for it to even come to my attention.

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:11.560
 You know, I mean, like I kept trying to figure out like a stereo solution.

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.480
 And then like I just kind of ran into a post on Muff's about it and I was like, wait a

01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:16.760
 minute, what the fuck is this?

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:19.480
 You know, I was like, this is small.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.640
 Looks exactly what I wanted.

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.120
 Had the high pass and low pass, you know, I mean, with the ability to do band.

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:27.480
 And yeah, I'm like, okay, this is everything that I wanted.

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:28.480
 Yeah.

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:32.520
 It's like somebody, somebody saw that there was a big gap in the market for something

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.520
 exactly like that.

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.200
 And they filled it and they did a great job in my opinion.

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:38.360
 Or they've been reading your dream journal.

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:39.360
 Yeah.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.360
 Yeah.

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:41.840
 They have a new one coming out.

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.720
 I think it's still called Medusa Mod or something else, but it's like a Euclidean LFO.

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:48.920
 That's a pretty interesting idea actually.

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.320
 Like I guess a synced LFO based off Euclidean kind of sequences.

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.440
 And I'm like pretty curious about it.

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:59.680
 They have a kit that would be very interesting to me to get one.

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.240
 That sounds interesting.

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.680
 That was that was my list of good stuff.

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.280
 There's no honorable, honorable mention.

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:07.280
 There's no.

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:14.360
 I just have the one thing that was that didn't cut the mustard or me go for it.

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:17.160
 Like complaint that was mutable instruments, beads.

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.160
 Oh, yeah.

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.160
 Same.

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:22.640
 Took a year to get.

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.880
 And it didn't last long on my rack once I finally got it in there.

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.240
 Lasted a couple of weeks for me.

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:29.240
 Yeah.

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.560
 I sold mine.

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:35.400
 Like I figured I would keep it to see if I eventually, you know, got to that point with

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:41.800
 it almost every time I was still going to clouds slash monsoon over it.

01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:44.320
 And I was like, eh, you know, like, I don't know.

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:50.160
 Especially with the extra modes that clouds give you.

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.160
 It's just, I mean, I guess that's what they were going for was a more refined clouds and

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.160
 that's cool.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.560
 But like should we find the other modes too?

01:36:58.560 --> 01:36:59.560
 Yeah.

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.440
 And had them available on there and then maybe out of cat beads, but like, yeah, because

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:06.960
 I still use the other modes on clouds constantly, you know, like, I don't know.

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:10.000
 It's Swiss army knife to me.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:19.080
 But something of interest though, Emily posted on the mutual instruments forums in response

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:27.520
 to a post that she'll be releasing the source code for beads in about three to four months

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:31.040
 at the time of this recording, at least.

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.120
 Parasites.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.680
 So exactly.

01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:39.920
 Like once that's out there, I'm super, super excited to see what people do with it.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:45.800
 And see, you know, what the eventual parasite firmware will be for beads.

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:50.680
 And to see what variations like hardware wise, like, you know, what's what's going to be

01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:55.520
 the monsoon of beads, you know, I'm real stoked to see.

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:59.320
 And hopefully it gets ported to VCV rack as well, because I'm using clouds in there

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:03.480
 a lot in conjunction with my two hardware clouds.

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:06.120
 Like you can never have enough clouds in my opinion.

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.520
 Yeah, it's everything on my list.

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:12.080
 My top picks, my mild disappointments.

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:15.320
 So then what are we all looking forward to in 2022?

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.680
 I was looking at a question.

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:21.040
 I've got a list of some of that stuff, actually.

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:24.560
 I didn't make a list, but I have a couple things off the top of my head.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.560
 I can say.

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.240
 I don't have a list.

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:33.760
 And I sort of covered it in the LZX section of video stuff that I'm looking forward to

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:34.760
 coming out.

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:37.520
 Outside of that, mostly my big thing is.

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:40.200
 I just want time to work on things.

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:45.680
 And that's not a module on something I can buy, but like high on my wish list is to just

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:49.000
 have time to be able to spend and get stuff done.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.840
 You've prepared a list, which is better than two of us.

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:57.480
 Really the only one that I even want to mention is the Oxyone sequencer is kind of the top

01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.040
 thing I'm looking for.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.480
 And that's now in production.

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.560
 I've been waiting for over half a year.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:08.200
 I think I pre-ordered that in June.

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:09.280
 And they're finally shipping out now.

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.640
 And I may have delayed mine because I also got the Oxy pipe, which is the Eurorack module

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:20.940
 that's passive that connects to the HDMI connection on the Oxyone to bring all the analog outputs

01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.260
 out of there.

01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:27.200
 And given that it's HDMI, I'm also wondering if that wouldn't work exactly the same with

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:30.560
 the Evaton link considering I guess it's just the same thing.

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:31.560
 You know what I mean?

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:32.560
 Yeah.

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:39.360
 I either bought the third Evaton link module that I wanted anyway, but haven't built yet.

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:45.920
 Or yeah, sadly, I've probably slowed down my getting this device because they're going

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:49.320
 to bundle the two together, but I'm also not in some rush.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:54.560
 But I'm really excited to get polyphonic sequencing into the mix again, especially with the

01:39:54.560 --> 01:40:04.640
 good cord and the access virus, which is still one of the few hardware since I still have

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.640
 the tie dust up.

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:09.280
 No, I thought you got rid of fucking years.

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:11.680
 I've teased that multiple times and never did.

01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:13.680
 A few people never bit on it.

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:16.080
 And I've just held on to it.

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.960
 I miss my TI dude like a mother.

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:18.960
 That's the thing.

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:22.000
 I still have hundreds of patches that I've made on there too.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.680
 Like banks of patches that I've made from scratch.

01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:27.280
 So I'm kind of glad that I have it for that too.

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.680
 It's crazy how ahead of its time it was.

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:36.120
 Even with the TI, the whole concept, the VST integration and shit like that, that was

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.640
 the way ahead of anybody else.

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.640
 People gave it shit.

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.640
 Oh yeah.

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:42.080
 Nothing really has come close to its sense.

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:43.080
 No.

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:44.800
 It's been over a decade.

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:48.000
 Still what like Depeche Mode uses when they tour and shit like that.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.760
 It's still like not much that can really touch it.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:55.160
 I'm excited for that sequencer because it's kind of like the deluge sequencer but like

01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:05.640
 a shit load of CVIO, eight pairs of CV gate for sequencing and MIDI out and that HDMI out.

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:09.200
 I actually was going to ask you what this is.

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:11.760
 I'm not familiar and it's possible.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.240
 Listeners are also not familiar.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:19.620
 It's a hardware button grid sequencer that's MIDI and CV but it seems to be like almost

01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.780
 end all be all.

01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:24.420
 It's got like all the electron trigger conditions in it.

01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:26.220
 It's got polyphonic sequencing.

01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:30.780
 It's got chord modes that'll help you figure out which chords to play kind of thing like

01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:34.140
 a lot of devices do now.

01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:35.140
 But it just looks pretty rad.

01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.940
 So this is kind of like mono-mish?

01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:38.780
 A little bit.

01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:40.100
 Not like the apps on there.

01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:47.900
 It's more like straightforward left to right sequencing like piano roll style but the CV

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:51.260
 gate options like it's the most like it would be.

01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:56.620
 I don't have polyphonic MIDI CV right now and I'm excited to have that again.

01:41:56.620 --> 01:42:00.380
 It looks like I could be able to drive a lot like I could play a live set with just that

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:05.260
 sequencer and a modular and a rhythm kind of thing.

01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:08.300
 It seems very very capable.

01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:12.540
 Very nice button grid definitely for editing and everything like that 16 by 8 kind of

01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:14.500
 thing I think.

01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:20.140
 The compact can work just over Bluetooth to like a laptop.

01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:23.380
 For some impressions from people that are getting it it seems to be pretty on the mark

01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:24.820
 and they've been working on it for a while.

01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:28.420
 They actually delivered on time so pretty impressive.

01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:30.260
 Even all the shit that's going on now.

01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.500
 Yeah I haven't heard of that before either.

01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:37.100
 Yeah that's the big one that I've been looking for too.

01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:42.500
 And that it was kind of why I sold the pyramid mark 3-2 because I wasn't using it and I

01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:47.740
 was also like oh this is about going to cover the price of that and this would eclipse everything

01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:49.700
 I was doing with the pyramid.

01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:54.380
 It gives you the ability to have a real keyboard to use which I don't quite have right now.

01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:58.900
 And I'll say hook my key step up to the performer and that's still not quite the same.

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:03.100
 So kind of excited to have something like that that will integrate polycents in with

01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.100
 the modular stuff.

01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:07.140
 I think musically that'll be something I want to do.

01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:08.460
 Yeah that sounds awesome.

01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:09.860
 And it's imminent.

01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:12.740
 I mean this is something you're going to be getting soon.

01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:16.980
 Oh yeah yeah I will at the latest be getting it in February.

01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:18.580
 Oh shit that's real soon.

01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:21.780
 Yeah they're shipping like 90 out a week or something like that.

01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:26.780
 So they've been pretty transparent about the whole thing and they actually ship some out

01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:31.340
 to people by Christmas which is their goal so they hit it so that's always pretty impressive.

01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:35.140
 I have three things I'll mention briefly.

01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:41.620
 Things should be shipping this month finally and that's my pre-order for the microcosm.

01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:43.140
 The hologram microcosm pedal.

01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.140
 Hell yeah.

01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:50.420
 I'm excited to integrate that with my modular and have it you know be able to go in and

01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:52.940
 out with it.

01:43:52.940 --> 01:44:00.780
 The plankton slash winter modular zaps drum module.

01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:06.620
 I'm kind of really hyped for that thing and I hope it comes out on track.

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:10.540
 Like it's supposed to be out I think they said first quarter of 2022.

01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:12.500
 So I've been keeping an eye on that.

01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:18.220
 I'm not a fan of pre-ordering so I haven't done that but you know once I see it it's

01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:20.980
 actually out upper I jump on it.

01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:25.060
 And then one that we've mentioned briefly in the past it still has yet to come out but

01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:30.860
 it's supposed to be coming out soon and that's the miso modular cornflakes granular process.

01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:32.740
 Yeah yeah.

01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:36.340
 Kind of hyped for that thing.

01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:41.820
 I was hyped for that thing more than beads originally and now since I've kind of flipped

01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:45.420
 on beads I'm hyped about it even more.

01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:49.980
 I'm hoping this fills the gap for me that I'm looking for.

01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:50.980
 That's about it.

01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:55.620
 I guess we can wait to see what the fuck gets announced at NAMM or whatever you know if

01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:57.740
 there's any big announcements.

01:44:57.740 --> 01:44:58.940
 I don't know if they're doing it.

01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:01.780
 I think they might have scrapped NAMM or something like that.

01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:02.780
 Oh completely.

01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:03.780
 I don't know.

01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:08.300
 I saw something about that today that might have indicated there wasn't going to be a

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:09.300
 NAMM.

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:13.420
 But I was going to say the cornflakes seems like it's a little controversial to the way

01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:19.260
 they're going about it like pre-ordering a 3D render picture off control mod and things

01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:20.260
 like that.

01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:23.420
 A lot of people that are playing haven't pre-ordered it.

01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:27.100
 Yeah because it seems like vaporware currently.

01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:30.780
 There's no demos except for the early prototypes.

01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:34.100
 There's been no announcements since those early prototypes.

01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:40.260
 It's been almost a year of radio silence except for it popping up as being available

01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:46.020
 for pre-order at perfect circuit and it's just like it's a rendered picture.

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:47.020
 It's like ah.

01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:48.780
 I'm not a venture capitalist.

01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:51.020
 I'm not here to fund your company.

01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:52.020
 Right.

01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:57.620
 Like if it's only going to come out, if it gets enough pre-orders then that's...

01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:58.620
 Then just do a Kickstarter.

01:45:58.620 --> 01:45:59.620
 Yeah.

01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:01.900
 You know what I mean.

01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:07.460
 But so yeah I'm waiting to see if it actually comes out and more demos of it in action.

01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:10.820
 But I'm optimistic about it.

01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:11.820
 It looks interesting.

01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:14.020
 I'd love to see a good demo.

01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:16.260
 That's all I's gots.

01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:17.260
 Is that it?

01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:19.700
 Did we wrap up 2021?

01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:23.180
 I think we did.

01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:24.380
 We weren't too harsh on it.

01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:25.780
 I mean it's kind of hard.

01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:26.780
 Yeah.

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:28.780
 So much shit didn't come out.

01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:29.980
 You know what I mean.

01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:34.620
 And I'm almost glad because I didn't have the money for shit that I originally had planned

01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:35.620
 for.

01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:39.460
 Ended up downsizing instead of expanding.

01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:45.180
 The downsizing in conjunction with VCD Rack like I'm super productive right now more so

01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:48.780
 than I've been since I was working on that last record.

01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:52.060
 Like I had a burst of productivity for a couple months while I was working on that

01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:53.060
 album.

01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:58.460
 And it's been kind of in a lull sense until like these last few weeks all of a sudden

01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:04.180
 I'm finding myself actually making progress and it's kind of refreshing.

01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:05.420
 Yeah I feel that.

01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:06.500
 I'm in similar spot.

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:10.100
 I've been getting a lot down when I sit down to do anything.

01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:11.100
 That's been nice.

01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:16.900
 Just a little bit of focus and nothing shifted too much fundamentally so that helps a lot.

01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:17.900
 Yeah.

01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:23.220
 I mean I was going to say something like take that 2021 but.

01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:24.820
 Yeah suck it.

01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:26.820
 I like it with the business.

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:28.820
 But that in your pipe.

01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:29.820
 2021.

01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:32.660
 Even 2021 didn't want to be 2021 this year.

01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:33.660
 Yeah.

01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:34.660
 No this is hard.

01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:35.660
 I got it.

01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:39.140
 I just want to stay in bed to 2021.

01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:46.140
 Yeah.
