WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.420
 - So what were we talking about before episode 32?

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.260
 - Wow.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.500
 - Talking about modules and analog synth voices.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.220
 - Yeah.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.380
 - Wait, we're up to 32.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.220
 - We're up to 32.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.060
 - Holy shit.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.200
 - Yep.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.660
 - Nah, that seems like a lot.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.340
 - People have listened to 32 episodes of our bullshit.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.660
 - That's like a whole day plus, of listening to us.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.900
 And on stop us.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.740
 - It's a lot.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.780
 - That's too much of us.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.660
 - Way too much.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.220
 - Or is it just not enough?

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.060
 - It'll be the case.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.700
 - We gotta give people more.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.900
 - People in the future do like twin peaks

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.020
 and do marathons of listening to us.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.660
 - Oh God.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.500
 Wow.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.020
 - The face is all happening.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.020
 (laughing)

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.060
 - If someone does, I wanna know about it.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.900
 - Yeah.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.900
 - I wanna hear from this person like,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.020
 hey, I was on an international flight to Australia.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.620
 I just listened to your guys' podcast the entire time.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.420
 I'm like, damn.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.620
 I wanna know about that.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.580
 - So if anybody's gone full dumpster so far, let us know.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.580
 - I mean, maybe they have, but there's like,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.980
 they just snapped at the end.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.020
 Like there was no way for them to communicate this task

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.860
 that they had done.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.060
 They had finished because they just ran into the woods naked

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.380
 and never to be seen from a guy.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.740
 - Why won't they make the Octra Trap?

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 They should have made!

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.260
 (laughing)

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.380
 - Why won't they just re-release

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.940
 the fucking machine drum already?

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.020
 (laughing)

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.700
 - God, I can't handle this.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.060
 - Oh.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.460
 (laughing)

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.780
 - Goddamn.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.620
 - Speaking of electrons.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.460
 - Electrons.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.380
 - The electron corner has some activity this episode.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.740
 - That's true.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.580
 - That's true.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.660
 - We both received electron machines, one old, one new.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.180
 - Yeah.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.020
 - Yeah.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.860
 - Well.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.860
 - Something borrowed, something blue.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.700
 - Yeah.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.020
 - Yeah.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.300
 - Your hair is blue.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.540
 - Truly shit.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.420
 - It's all come together.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.260
 - It is.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.100
 We just haven't borrowed it.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.140
 - I don't know what it is, but it's come together.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.180
 - It is, I feel it.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.900
 - It's like the DaVinci Code.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.200
 - This is the Lost Anne Brown short story.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.260
 - Before we dip in an electron,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.860
 we forgot to mention over the last two episodes.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.460
 We're on YouTube now.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.820
 - We are, we are, yeah.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.700
 - People should be aware, I feel.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.460
 We've painstakingly uploaded our entire back catalog

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.860
 to the tubes.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.540
 Added some amazing visuals from DaVinci.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.140
 - Whoa, last name.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.980
 - Oh shit.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.820
 - From DaVinci.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.140
 (laughing)

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.980
 - Appreciate that.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.820
 - That's a great sound.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.660
 - Yeah.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.580
 To go along with it.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.500
 So you don't have to look at us.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.220
 - I should make some new video for that.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.980
 I feel like we've used that one enough.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.820
 - We've tapped them.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.660
 - Yeah, let me.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.860
 - I'm dry now for 32 episodes.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.100
 - I'm gonna make a note to make some new videos.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.820
 So listeners, by all means go get caught up.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.060
 Watch those videos.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.980
 Smash that subscribe button.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.780
 - Smash that fucking subscribe button.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.380
 Get us some numbers.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.460
 We need some clout.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.620
 - Leave comments.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.300
 - We can get free metropolis's.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.460
 - Free metropolis, tell us things that we said

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.540
 that were not true.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.380
 It's all good.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.220
 - Yeah.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.460
 - Wait, did we get, we got a comment.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.340
 - We need that ad, right?

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.340
 Yes, you did.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.180
 - And it was something.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.580
 - And someone did correct that.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.340
 - Well, I got his name here.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.100
 I told him, on our last episode,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.100
 a user named bestman3n commented

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.820
 that you're fucking wrong, Dave.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.500
 He didn't say that, but he said it nicely.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.580
 - You said you could feel that's new.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.300
 - He said you actually can rotate the steps

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.300
 of the Mascua using, or the first step, I should say.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.220
 - Yes, yes.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.940
 - Using CV input on the expander.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.420
 - Which would, and thank you to this user

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.500
 'cause I went back and I was like,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.700
 yeah, that's exactly what that input allows you to do.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.980
 Sort of moving that first step around,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.620
 the whole thing spins around.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.180
 It's exactly what you asked.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.900
 And so here's a question.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.660
 I was wrong.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.300
 Does that mean I lied?

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.420
 - It means you must be punished now.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.260
 - Okay, fair enough.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.180
 - I'd point.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.700
 - You have to put your nose in the corner

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.020
 for the rest of the episode.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.860
 - Oh, okay.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.940
 I guess I'll be back.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.780
 Let me know when I'm done.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.260
 (laughing)

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
 - Let me know when I can come back.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.900
 I do appreciate that feedbacks.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.140
 And I'm sure I will be wrong again.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.140
 In this episode probably, I'm usually wrong in some way.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.980
 - I usually am.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.820
 Smash that subscribe button

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.220
 and tell us how we're wrong.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.060
 - Yeah.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.900
 - We love to hear it.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.740
 - Yeah.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.260
 - Maybe we'll send you a drink?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.260
 - Coozy.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.260
 - Free Coozy.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.820
 - Actually, yeah, we should send them a drink Coozy.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.820
 I still have like one or two left.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.100
 - Yeah, I have a few as well.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.100
 So yeah, best man three in.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.060
 If you want a drink Coozy, hit us up.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.580
 - Yeah, you're gonna hit us up though.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.620
 - You're gonna give us the adi.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.700
 We're not gonna come to you.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.540
 - Yeah.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.460
 - We're not gonna hunt you down.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.300
 - That works.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.620
 - We should get some stickers made too.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.140
 We talked about this like, it's like every three months.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.980
 - Yeah.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.220
 - We should get stickers and t-shirts made.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.060
 - Yeah.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.580
 - And then it gets nowhere.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.460
 - True.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.220
 - This is the motivation because we go to send this user,

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.180
 this YouTube user, like a care package.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.940
 And it can't just be a Coozy.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.140
 It has to be more than that.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.060
 - You give me the art for the latest ones and all.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.060
 I'll do the thing.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.900
 - Excellent.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.740
 - Yeah.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.060
 I mean, I could just hit reorder on the stickers

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.100
 we made for Nopcon.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.460
 - Yeah, as I was gonna say, actually.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.220
 - I think Nopcon is usually our deadline.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.220
 Like, oh shit, we gotta get this done by Nopcon.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.060
 - Right, right.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.460
 - But there hasn't been a Nopcon for two years now.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.780
 Well, there's one coming up.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.580
 - There is one coming up, but we're not going.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.180
 - Yeah.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.060
 - At first I feel like probably,

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.980
 probably shouldn't happen.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.540
 - Yeah, I'll have a break.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.700
 - You know, I see a lot of other conventions canceling.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.660
 It doesn't seem like anyone from out of country

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.820
 can even come at this point.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.420
 - People are just so close.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.380
 - Nails just canceled that tour.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.460
 - Trend resonant, he was saying, nope.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.500
 Gonna try to keep people safe.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.340
 - Yeah.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.180
 - I'm on a suit and tie guy.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.780
 - Except that it can't happen yet.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.940
 - Shelve your ideas, save them all up.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.460
 We'll have a big crazy one in 2022.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.140
 - Yeah, 2022, we're gonna come out just absolutely hard.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.820
 - No, because Nopcon revival could be nuts.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.580
 - And like, it is clothing optional.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.260
 It is like full on like, we've been pent up,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.140
 haven't had this in a while.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.420
 It's just gonna be, yeah.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.940
 - Nerds in the nude, yep.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.020
 - Nerds out the cage.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.260
 That's the theme.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.340
 - Who's the one for like October Fast or something?

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.540
 What the fuck was it before?

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.740
 There was that banner that had like nothing to do

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.140
 with the rest of the fucking cause.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.060
 - September.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.740
 Fast.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.580
 - Yeah, I don't remember.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.580
 - I can't remember.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.060
 - I don't remember.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.060
 - As it usually is.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.900
 - I was wondering, it was like Indiana Jones themed.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.020
 I thought that was like.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.860
 - Yeah.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.820
 - That was one of the first couple.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.660
 - Yeah.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.860
 - I don't, I actually don't remember

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.380
 they have themes until we go.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.380
 - We can just make them up.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.220
 - We can just make them up.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.060
 - Yeah.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.420
 - Raiders of the Lost Arb.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.580
 - That was an album.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.620
 The Lost Arb.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.460
 - How was it?

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.300
 - Yeah.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.140
 - I thought there was one.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.140
 Yeah, we should just make up our own.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.240
 - Temples of.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.900
 - Was it no October Fast?

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.980
 - Oh, maybe it was no October Fast.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.500
 - No, it's.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.580
 - It's what, okay.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.420
 (laughing)

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.860
 - Temple of drone.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.140
 - Temple of.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:06.980
 - Temple of.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:13.460
 - I mean, the world we're trying to replace is dope.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.300
 - Yeah.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.060
 - Which is already pretty good already.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.420
 - Right, right.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.020
 - But like accurately describes not so.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.020
 - Yeah.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.580
 - You should do that it do.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.180
 So what were we talking about?

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.500
 - I don't know, but it wouldn't be an episode

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.740
 if we didn't shit talk knob com.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.580
 - Yeah.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.420
 - So we got that out of the way.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.260
 - And it's so close.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.100
 - Free to proceed from here.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.940
 - Yeah.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.780
 - While we were about to shit talk electron.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.620
 - Yeah.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.460
 - So everything's signed up.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.300
 - Oh yeah.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.140
 - We're in the groove now.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.820
 - Like expanded the scope of electron corner.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.660
 It's like the full room or half a room.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.700
 What's it like the,

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.540
 oh, what's it called?

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.060
 Like the breakfast nook.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.020
 It's taking, it's more like the electron breakfast nook

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:54.860
 at this point.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.820
 - Just makes me want to go to knob con

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.620
 and hang out at the electron booth.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.900
 - Why don't you put the machine drum back out?

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.340
 - When is there gonna be a mono machine mark two, bro?

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.180
 - Come on.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.420
 - I ask you this every year,

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.940
 you never give me an answer.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.540
 - Get your probability in.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.540
 - It's like the two lines of C.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.900
 - Oh God.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.060
 - I can't even imagine running one of those booths,

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.500
 especially one of the electron one

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.380
 where everyone's gonna stop and hit it up.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.500
 - Oh yeah, I'd run one with a taser.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.020
 That's for sure.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.340
 - You like listen, come with focused questions

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.660
 and you get put the fuck down.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.700
 - Right.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.540
 Or like a whip.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.780
 Like a, I mean going back to like the Indiana Jones theme,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.620
 like a whip.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.820
 Like if you, like I will chase you out of this booth.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.220
 - Yeah, you need the whip.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.020
 The taser's gonna run out of juice.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.620
 - Yeah, rhythm mark two, it's black, it makes drum sounds.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.620
 - Is it black?

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.460
 - I thought.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.300
 - Yeah.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.140
 - Okay. - It is.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.980
 - So I remember seeing the mark two

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.980
 come on weren't they gray or?

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.820
 - They were.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.660
 - They were all gray.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.500
 - They changed it.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.340
 - Yeah.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.380
 - Now they don't do the gray anymore, just black.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.220
 - Good.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.060
 - Which I like.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.900
 - The gray was ugly.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.740
 - Oh yeah, it looks bad.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.580
 Doesn't look good.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.060
 - Was the sound engine improved like the digit act?

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.340
 - I think it sounds better.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.700
 They say it's the same internals.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.540
 I think there's more bass definition

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.740
 just like the digit act.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.620
 It sounds very clean, even the reverb

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.820
 so like much cleaner than the one that I have.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.900
 So it's definitely different in a good way.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.220
 The fucking, I don't know why they swapped

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.460
 the function of the track buttons.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.060
 And I thought I was gonna be able to get over it,

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.660
 but hey, I'm gonna keep my mark one.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.340
 So they're always both gonna be different

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.020
 and it's completely fucking with me.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.180
 To the point where I'm gonna ask them

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.180
 just to put an option in.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.980
 So can you just put it in the operating system

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.500
 like swap these behind the scenes

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.740
 and know just like, 'cause I don't look at the label,

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.020
 I just need to know the tracks at the fucking top.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.220
 It's not, it's fucking with me.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.140
 'Cause I can't get used to it

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.300
 'cause I keep amusing both machines all the time.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.340
 So that's kind of fucking annoying.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.580
 I don't know why they did that.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.500
 It makes no sense to me.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.460
 They did redo the buttons up at the top

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.660
 and they added more so you can get to like

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.740
 the ways you like edit certain things more easily.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.580
 - The track selection has always annoyed me

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.180
 about the rhythm in the first,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.580
 but in fact I was just talking to you about that

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.100
 the other day Dave, you made fun of me

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.940
 'cause it's literally just a two button combo,

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.340
 but it still was annoying.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.180
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.460
 Playing with the machine drum again reminds me

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.300
 of how much faster it is on there.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.140
 - Yeah.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.700
 - To defer that to the,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.980
 - It changed it. - I mean, now it gets the rhythm.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:15.820
 - Yeah. - It changed it

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.660
 on the rhythm changes.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.060
 - Change it yet again. - When you just hit the pad,

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.300
 it selects the track, which is fine, but that's not what--

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.140
 - Cool, that's what I always wanted.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.220
 - I'm used to that button combo, I can do that.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.060
 - Oh really?

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.940
 - It's just, it's in me.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:26.780
 - I hate that.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.020
 - I absolutely hate it though.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.100
 - And they fucked with it.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.660
 It's something that I know very well.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.820
 And it's kind of fucking with me.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.020
 - Yeah, I don't know why they switched it.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.900
 It's like a trolling a certain group of people.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.700
 I would have preferred it that way personally.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.540
 - Right.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.620
 - Well, no, I can see the selection, I get that.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.340
 Now I'm getting used to that.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.420
 So maybe I won't need to fuck with the combo anymore,

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.940
 but it's just like, I don't wanna have to relearn that.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.060
 It's like, they put the whammy bar

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.460
 on the other side of the fucking guitar.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.300
 You know what I mean?

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.140
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.280
 - I've been using, yeah, it's a weird analogy.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.420
 Still fits in my Pelican case, which is nice.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.180
 I thought it wouldn't.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.540
 It'll just barely fit in the 1500 that I had the Mark 1 in.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.700
 I thought I was gonna have to buy some new stupid thing.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.260
 - Nice.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.380
 - Quick performance is what fucking makes it.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.780
 That knob, like the fact that you can assign

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.260
 a bunch of the performance pads to that knob

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.820
 and then just turn those and like do that in real time.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.900
 And so like, so makes it, I can transition completely

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.820
 differently on there and do different stuff.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.340
 It opens up like playing it a lot.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.740
 That was worth it alone.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.700
 But something like, they added this update to transfer,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.100
 the app that lets you back shit up.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.500
 So you can finally back up the samples

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.580
 and your whole kit and the patterns now and that's great.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.660
 But I can't get the samples in the right order

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.220
 on my Mark 1 and the way they should be on the Mark 2.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.340
 So I have to go in and like fix every fucking kit

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.780
 and redesign the samples.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.740
 I don't know.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.900
 They won't answer my post on the forum about it.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.900
 I have no idea.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.500
 Maybe it's 'cause when I try to do a backup.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.940
 - Stella, let's try on support continually.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.900
 - Oh yeah, so good.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.700
 When I try to do a backup of the Mark 1

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.180
 of the samples, it was like, oh,

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.860
 all of these samples are corrupt.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.220
 Even though it's crazy fine.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.060
 - I'm gonna be doing it.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.060
 - So I couldn't really get around that, but I had a backup.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.580
 So cool, I've had all these samples for years now.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.940
 I haven't really changed them much,

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.300
 but I have to manually fix them.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.780
 And so it's just like, I let the Mark 1

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.300
 play back the patterns as they should be

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.540
 and I'm just using the Mark 2 to make new shit now.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.780
 Which is probably better anyway.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.860
 But they claim like, oh, now zip up a project

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.540
 and send it to your friend.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.260
 And it's like, that's all I'm trying to do.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.380
 The friend being me.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.700
 And I can't get it to my friend.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.500
 (laughing)

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.620
 And they won't answer the thing.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.980
 So I'm just kind of like, eh,

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.900
 I'm just gonna enjoy this thing.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:37.740
 'Cause it does work.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.140
 Like there's no other like issue with it.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.060
 Pads are way fucking nicer.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.980
 It makes it easier to enter like sequences

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.260
 and chromatic stuff.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.820
 I don't necessarily use it.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.740
 Like it's not like better for NPC drumming.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.860
 It's more just easier to record sequences

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.900
 and shit like that.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.900
 - They're so stiff on the Mark 1.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.740
 - So bad.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.180
 - Like trying to use the performance pads

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.540
 to, you know, I don't know for it.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.060
 It's like very difficult.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.900
 - To do.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.540
 - 'Cause the most stiff they were.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.380
 But.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.540
 - It took me a couple of days to break these in.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.380
 'Cause at first they wouldn't select quite that well.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.300
 - But now it's perfect.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.260
 It seems really good.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.740
 - You didn't have either of them.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.380
 You were starting from scratch or only got one.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.980
 The Mark 2 would be where you would go?

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:19.820
 - Okay.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.140
 - Well, if you don't factor in price,

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.060
 you can still get the Mark 1 for like 700 bucks on a reverb.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.740
 Which to me is like crazy deal.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.740
 That does sound like a good deal.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.740
 - That's fucking, that's still the most ridiculous

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.740
 drum machine out there.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.260
 The Mark 2 just solidifies it.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
 The sampling is awesome.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.460
 It made me, I was kind of wanting a digitact

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.740
 even though like your experience really put me off of it.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.740
 Especially with the updates,

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.060
 but this has really killed that lust for me.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.660
 Even though I hope they had a second LFO to the rhythm.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.180
 That would be tight.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.580
 - Yeah, I'm psyched on it.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.420
 It's a good improvement.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.260
 I'm used to everything else.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.100
 - There's still only one LFO.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.940
 - Wow.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.780
 - Yeah.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.620
 - Interesting.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.460
 - Yeah.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.860
 - I don't know why all the things like

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.220
 putting another one in there goes a long way.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.740
 - Especially because that's like the digital area

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.940
 of that device.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.140
 So like, I don't know.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:06.980
 - You think?

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.260
 - Not like you're stealing from the analog voices

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.460
 or anything, I don't think.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.780
 - That's what I would think too.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.940
 - Sounds fantastic though.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.740
 I've been digging, just sitting on the couch with it,

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.900
 making new patterns and shit

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.140
 when I don't feel like going upstairs.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.980
 - So.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.820
 - Nice.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.500
 - Yeah, no regrets.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.900
 - That's a generally positive thing

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.220
 from the electron corner right now.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.060
 - Yeah.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.900
 Fuck yeah.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.220
 - Yeah, I'm totally enjoying it.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.980
 Especially for that quick perf,

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.100
 the better pads and just the extra buttons

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.460
 that they've added and some niceties.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.580
 It's like they didn't fix a lot.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.540
 That was kind of fucked up with it.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.100
 I don't know why they swapped those two buttons

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.060
 but whatever.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.060
 It's a head fuck.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.900
 - Yeah.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.460
 - I mean, maybe they did it with the intent

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.420
 of fucking with your head

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.740
 and if that was the case, Bravo.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.140
 It's a good thing. - They did it.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.420
 - And nailed the landing.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.260
 - You fucking did.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.740
 - Your head is fucked.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.060
 Speaking of head fucker Greg.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:52.900
 - Yeah.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.300
 - You also have a contribution to the electron corner.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.140
 - I do.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:56.980
 - I do.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.380
 I have to do a little bit of back story though.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.340
 Start it out with the LXR.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.860
 - True.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.820
 - Can you do this in like a narrator voice?

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.220
 Like the start of a movie like exposition?

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.060
 - Like a acquisition blade runner?

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:11.900
 - Yes, yes.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.460
 (laughing)

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.820
 I don't know what your narrator voice is.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.820
 We've heard your God voice.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.940
 - Maybe we could just have him speak regularly

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.060
 and then find an AI that can turn it into

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.780
 like deep fake and narrator voice.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.620
 - Yeah.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.460
 - So now we're gonna be deep fake.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.020
 - Yeah, like James Earl Jones or like a...

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.340
 - Oh God.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.180
 - Yeah.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.420
 (laughing)

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.500
 - Simba, when will they release the model machine mark two?

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.420
 - Oh shit.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.300
 - Oh, we don't need to find anything.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.900
 You can just do it.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.180
 So finish your exposition in your James Earl Jones.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.020
 We'll wait.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.100
 - I can't.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.820
 It would be disrespectful to Dorotheter

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.180
 for me to try and make that voice.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.260
 - Oh, okay.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.740
 - So go on with your exposition, my exposition.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:01.380
 I wanted the Alex R2, mark two.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.900
 After we discussed it in our last episode,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.620
 I was like, you know what?

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.860
 Yeah, I think I'm gonna make the jump.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.820
 I think I had it on pre-order actually in the last episode

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.140
 and then it just didn't arrive yet,

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.500
 but yeah, it finally arrived.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.700
 I was a little disappointed with it.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.340
 So, first thing I noticed right off the bat

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.340
 which kind of tilted me a little,

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.260
 it was very minor, but annoyed me.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.940
 The encoders were moving on their own.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.660
 If I adjusted a knob for a specific value every once in a while,

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.020
 the value would jump up by one number

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.460
 for something that I wasn't touching the knob for.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.100
 Like say I was adjusting the course tuning.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:41.940
 - Yeah.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.900
 - I would see like, you know,

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.260
 like the, say like the bit rate value or something

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.060
 and adjust on a different value.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.660
 I didn't commit the memory which values I saw changing

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.580
 on their own, but I definitely kept seeing things jump up

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.780
 by like a single digit.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.780
 - So what's your intuition?

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.340
 Do you think it was hardware related or a software glitch?

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.300
 Have you heard of anyone else having this problem?

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.780
 - Didn't really look into it.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:05.660
 It annoyed me.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.700
 My, oh God, that sounds, that would be maddening.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.060
 - And I didn't remember that ever happening on the Mark I.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.900
 - Yeah.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.060
 - So I was like, okay.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.500
 - Yeah, never had that.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.460
 - Also notice some of the global effects

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.940
 didn't seem to be working properly.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.540
 Such as like the compressor and things like that.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.900
 Some of them just didn't seem to be doing anything.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.740
 I was like, what the hell?

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.020
 I don't know what that was all about.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:32.020
 Aside from that, everything was seemingly okay.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.020
 You know, it was functioning like the Mark I

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.740
 same old familiar territory.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.020
 And I was like, okay, this is cool.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.420
 It had a cool sound.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:44.500
 I liked the, you know, the FM drums,

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.300
 but I forgot that you can't change them.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.180
 Like if I wanted, like, you know what I mean?

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.700
 Like they're hard set what each drum is

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.500
 unless you're using like the wave shape.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.340
 - Oh, yeah.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.980
 - And that kind of annoyed me.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.260
 Like sometimes I just want a bank of kick drums.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.100
 - Oh, that's what you were saying.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.900
 - Yeah, and like you can't really do that on air.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.020
 You can do that on the TR8S

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.060
 and I remembered that you can do that on the machine drum.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.740
 And I was like, you know what?

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.620
 Everything that I was kind of like wanting

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.980
 out of a drum machine just kept pointing me back

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.380
 to the machine drum.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.940
 And I was like, okay, I just spent $600 on this LXR.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.900
 It's not quite what I want.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.380
 Do I really want to jump to double that price

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.540
 to get an old machine drum?

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.900
 And like I spent some time debating it

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.460
 and eventually I came to the conclusion that yes,

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.460
 yes I do.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.780
 So I returned the LXR.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.660
 - That would be so weird if the answer was no.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.340
 - Yeah, and that's where the story ended.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.500
 You're like, no, I didn't get one.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.540
 - No, but I did.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.580
 Yeah, so I returned the LXR.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.460
 I feel like there isn't enough reason

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.180
 to get a Mark II right now.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.020
 - Yeah.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.820
 - I feel like maybe if they add any more substantial

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.540
 improvements over the Mark I, then go for it.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.380
 But like the lack of the triggers, you know,

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.980
 and the CV triggers and the micro timing

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.300
 on the sequencing and things like that,

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.000
 it's actually like a step down.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.140
 - Yes, the sliders are nice.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.020
 That's about it.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.540
 Other than that, I think it'd be better off

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.220
 getting a Mark I for very cheap right now.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.260
 They're selling for like $400.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.100
 - Oh, really?

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.380
 - Yeah, because the Mark IIs came out.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.460
 So yeah, they've dipped down in price.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.820
 - Oh, I didn't see that.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.980
 - I saw a couple going used on like reverb

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.500
 and muffs for around 400 bucks.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.140
 And I was like, that's a good fucking deal.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.940
 - Yeah, they were seven for a while.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.900
 - Yeah.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.860
 So yeah, I would say Mark II LXR, not worth it right now.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.820
 However, a machine drum, still worth every penny.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.580
 The prices have gone up steeply.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.580
 Oh, I got mine for a few hundred dollars less

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.140
 than what they are currently going on for reverb that I see.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.220
 'Cause I got one off of muffs and the dude was really cool

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.940
 and willing to give a fair price

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.420
 instead of trying to compete

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.180
 with the super fucking inflated prices of reverb right now.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.140
 So I don't know if he wants me to say his name

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.780
 or anything, so I won't call him out,

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.740
 but yeah, two thumbs up to him for giving a fair deal.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.500
 And so far I'm loving the machine drum.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:21.260
 I installed the new unofficial firmware, the X.04.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.100
 - So what is that, what is that ad?

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.820
 - It adds a few things.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.140
 Someone wish I haven't really dipped into yet at all.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.020
 It adds a couple, I put it in my notes here.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.700
 A new spin on the GND machines are available.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.860
 Like you got GND SN Pro,

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.060
 which is four sign oscillators.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.540
 You got the SW saw-thoose triangle

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.740
 with three variable waveform oscillators,

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.940
 GND PU, which is a pulse wave machine,

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.500
 adjustable ratio and up to three oscillators as well.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.260
 All of these GND machines have relative pitches

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.980
 for the additional oscillators and unison.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:03.980
 - Ooh. - It's capability.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.220
 - And yeah, I was having a lot of fun

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.620
 just playing around with those

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.540
 and the new tweaks for them.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:15.540
 On top of that, many of the currently existing machines

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:20.540
 gained a new tuning option for relative pitch.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.380
 I haven't really played with that too much,

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.100
 but yeah, it implements like quarter tone

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.140
 equal tempered scaling of the pitch parameter.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.460
 - Yeah, whereas before it was just zero to 128 or whatever.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.540
 - Right, and you had to like play it like a year.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.900
 - Yeah, now it's a little more musical, which is cool.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.060
 I've never used my, in the past,

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.180
 I've never used the machine drum as a synth,

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.180
 but you kind of can now.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.620
 This allows you to dip in a little bit of territory

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.620
 that reminded me of the Mono machine a bit.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.700
 And just from my past experience with the Mono machine,

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.700
 I was kind of fucking with the FM machines a little

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.660
 and trying to dial in some Mono machine like stuff.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.740
 But it's cool, I think it kind of helps it compete

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.740
 a little with the rhythm

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.860
 and that you can use it as a synth,

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.020
 which was really fun to do on the rhythm when I totally.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.620
 And there's talk of other things coming in future releases.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:16.300
 - So wait, this is not an electron firmware.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.700
 - So who is doing it?

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.780
 - I don't know.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.300
 This is like an open source project or is this like a--

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.140
 - It is.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.140
 - They can pull up who they are.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.260
 I mean, it's posted on the Electronauts forum

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.020
 and it's getting like near official support.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:30.860
 - Okay.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.940
 - But it's not like an X Electron employee or is it,

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.220
 you know, I was reading about this at one point

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.980
 and then I don't know how that happened.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.540
 'Cause I think somebody has the source code.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.620
 I don't know, I'm not knowledgeable enough.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.460
 - Okay.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.300
 - Someone by the name of Justin Vaylor or Valor.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.940
 And he references a team,

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.820
 so I guess it's more than just him.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.340
 Whoever they are, they're doing God's work.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.580
 And big ups to them

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.500
 for breathing fresh life into a 20 year old fucking machine.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.300
 - Now if you had their ear,

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.180
 and you know, there's obviously still working on it,

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.620
 what would you maybe ask them to add?

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.700
 - I had some ideas, most of which people

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.820
 are already asking for on the Electronauts forum.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.620
 So I'm just going to echo their thoughts as well.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.020
 Individual track lengths would be awesome.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.020
 - Yeah.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.020
 - Also probability, be very nice.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.220
 I don't really, I mean, that would be cool.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.100
 And it would bring it up to snuff with the other

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.500
 Electron devices, but that's not a huge thing to me

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.540
 right now because I'm kind of sequencing it

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.460
 with my poly and tracker.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.300
 - Yeah.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.500
 - So I can do probability via MIDI sequencing that way.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.540
 So not a big deal to me, really,

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:50.540
 but I would like to see more per track effects.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.100
 Like as it stands now, the reverb and the delay

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.660
 and the compressor, if I recall,

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.180
 are all global and only work if you're using

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.020
 the main stereo pair outs.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:00.860
 - Yeah.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.740
 - Which I'm not using.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.780
 Like I have everything broken down

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.780
 into individual track outputs and I'm processing it.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.980
 - So those are not getting the master effects

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.180
 and all those are just raw.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.740
 - All the electrons on them.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.980
 - Which I've always hated.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.580
 - Yeah, I've always fucking hated that.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.020
 And I don't know, maybe if there's enough room in there

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.100
 they could add like a per track delay,

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.780
 which is something that I thought was going to be

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.340
 in the LXR too and was appealing me,

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.180
 but it wasn't.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.700
 The delay on the LXR2 is also global.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.540
 - That sucks.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.060
 - Same with the compressor and things like that.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.860
 So it's very machine drum-ish in that way.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.580
 I would love to see if, you know, even a shitty delay.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.420
 You know what I mean?

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.780
 Like something that could just get really tight

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.340
 and kind of nasty would per channel or per track,

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.180
 I should say.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.020
 - Right, right.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.340
 - Would be cool, but not a big deal.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.300
 I'm currently running the individual track outputs

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.300
 through my own delays and shit like that.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.140
 - Yeah.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.100
 - Through the modular and pedals,

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.100
 but, so yeah, I don't know.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.460
 The machine drum has a stance.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.020
 I'm enjoying it a lot.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.100
 I don't feel like there's a whole lot I would ask for

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.100
 from a new firmware.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.420
 - Nice.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.340
 - It's just doing what it does.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.180
 At the time, I got sick of the machine drum

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.980
 because I was leaning more towards a modular drum machine,

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.100
 which is what I've been playing with conceptually

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.340
 for a couple of years now, which was fun.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.260
 - I've got a lot of, I don't know.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.100
 - You made some tracks.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.100
 - You made some tracks.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:25.940
 - Yeah.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.220
 - It was a fun experiment, but like, yeah, now it's just,

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.940
 it's too much to do.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.780
 - It's fun to have it with it.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:34.540
 - To even reproduce a fraction of what the machine drum

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.860
 can do in a modular would be thousands upon thousands

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.700
 of dollars.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.540
 - Right, yeah.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.740
 - Like the machine drum is 16 sounds.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.580
 You know what I mean?

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.540
 - Six. - Sixteen tracks.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.100
 Each one with its own filter, you know what I mean?

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.180
 And like parameters and it's.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.220
 - Making another configuration in a modular

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.140
 is like a fucking nightmare, you know?

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.120
 Where's the rhythm or machine drum

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.140
 you can just go to the next pattern in one second.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.020
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.060
 So yeah, I don't know.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.740
 I would still do a voice or two,

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.740
 probably percussion wise in the modular,

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.380
 but for the most part. - Yeah, that's different though.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.580
 Totally. - I'm doing it in the box now, you know?

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.060
 With the machine drum or any other drum machines

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.180
 that I get, routing it through the modular

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.820
 is definitely something that I didn't do before

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.900
 and really enjoying now.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.340
 - Oh, fuck, oh shit.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.900
 - It's a blast.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.900
 I mean, a machine drum still sounds like shit by itself.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.580
 It needs processing. - Right.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.500
 - You know what I mean?

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.220
 It sounds very plastic-y.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.380
 - That's not an uncommon,

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.220
 some of the machine-y. - Drum machine.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.660
 - Some like cardboard, you know?

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.500
 They always have.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.420
 And that was part of the charm of it.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.500
 - That's not an uncommon drum machine problem though.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.740
 I mean, you know. - That one especially,

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.460
 the God, some of the horrors that I evoked

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.940
 with that fucking thing in the body situation.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.460
 - Yeah, I mean, like comparing the sound engines

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.140
 to like the Riddemar 2, for example.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.140
 - Yeah.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.060
 - Fucking different world entirely.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:53.900
 - Totally.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.820
 - But yeah, I don't know.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.140
 I kind of like the shitty digital machines

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.500
 for what they are, you know what I mean?

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.820
 And I can get some interesting sounds out of them,

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.260
 especially once I start routing it through,

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.260
 you know, compression and overdrive and, you know,

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.340
 giving it, you know,

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.660
 running it through analog processing basically.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.500
 - Yeah. - You know,

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.340
 I would have to add some magic to those shitty digital machines.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.300
 - Yeah.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.140
 - That's why it's definitely,

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.020
 you getting one is definitely incited the lust again

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.140
 because I think I could wield it much more effectively

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.660
 than I could like 10 years ago or whatever the fuck that was.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:29.620
 - Yeah.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.260
 Yeah, now that I'm shifting the modular

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.260
 to be more processing and not like an all, you know,

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.940
 encompassing synth voice drum machine and all that,

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.540
 like, you know, if I just focus it on like processing,

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.860
 it's definitely shining a bit more for me.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.220
 - Yeah, those FM hats are pretty special though.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.060
 - Yeah.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.540
 - It's just some interesting magic in there.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.780
 - Yeah, for sure.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.180
 And not even the model cycles can like compete with it,

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.140
 which it was, it was from what we understand, you know,

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.460
 was designed to try and emulate some of that, right?

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.180
 Just doesn't quite hit it, you know.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.180
 - Not that I've heard.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.020
 - No.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.020
 The cycles inspired me too when I had one,

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.300
 I was like, yeah, I should get a machine drum

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.940
 again someday 'cause this is like close, you know what I mean?

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.980
 And it is a cool machine.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:16.980
 I can definitely see one to accommodate my machine drum now.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.820
 Right, you know what I mean?

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.260
 Especially like the unique features of that box,

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:25.100
 like the kick and the chord machines stood out for me, you know.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.100
 Those would go along with the machine drum pretty nicely, I think.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.580
 - Yeah, it'd be a fun live rig that pedals,

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.500
 you could, you could fuck some shit up.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.140
 - All right, so is that it for left, right corner?

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.100
 - Yeah, I mean, I don't wanna spend too much time

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.980
 focusing on the machine drum.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.820
 You know what I mean?

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.580
 It's a 20 year old box, you know.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.420
 - Right, right.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.100
 - You don't know what it does by now.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.860
 - We revisited the pass and dug up old artifacts before us.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:53.100
 - But the new OS, definitely loaded on there.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.820
 It's risk, it's worth the risk brick in your box, I think,

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:59.140
 to just have that much more functionality out of it, you know.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.460
 - Fuck yeah, I do it too.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:05.740
 And some of those new voices were pretty chipped to me,

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.580
 you know what I mean?

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.420
 That's not what I was trying to do, but just fucking around,

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.140
 I was like, oh, I've made some interesting

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.060
 little chipped in stuff.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.900
 Again, reminding me of like Mono Machine.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.740
 - Right.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.300
 - And I was like, okay, this is cool,

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.500
 'cause I don't think there will ever be a Mono Machine too,

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.680
 but if the machine drums, which are far more common,

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.620
 you can get you into slightly Mono Machine territory,

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.460
 you know what I mean?

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.780
 That's pretty cool, 'cause like,

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.300
 again, there's 16 fucking tracks on there, you know.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.740
 It's like, you're hardly ever gonna use all those

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.100
 in one drum patch, you know what I mean?

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.700
 So you can use other tracks in order to do other things

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.540
 - Right.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.980
 - Those machines, which is cool,

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.260
 and route them out individually,

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:51.260
 and you gotta drum machine and a synth all in one box.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:54.540
 It's pretty cool, and that's where I'm standing on.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.940
 - Now, do you wanna have an outro?

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.820
 So you had this sort of dramatic intro with exposition.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.780
 - I wanna say Erika sends me to step it up.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.500
 Like, you know, with the LXR,

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.140
 like, that would have been my go-to drum machine right now.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.980
 Had they taken it just a little further, you know?

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.580
 If you're gonna call something a Mark II,

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.020
 you gotta do more than just add sliders to it,

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:18.860
 in my opinion.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:19.980
 - Agreed. - Yeah.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.740
 - There needs to be some significant improvements

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:25.620
 to the firmware itself, and I'm hoping they'll come

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.660
 in the future.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.980
 - I mean, the sonic potions is not gonna deliver it.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.420
 There's at least now hope that Erika is going to

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.460
 actually do that.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.380
 - Yeah.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.740
 - A few of the second one though,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.260
 you're missing out on the probability on the substeps.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.540
 That's a lot of fun variation there.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.180
 - Yeah, yeah, the lack of the microsteps in the substeps.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.620
 Like, that was my favorite thing about the Mark I.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.460
 - Totally.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:47.300
 - So you're missing on it.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.140
 - You can just shut out of that.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:48.980
 - Using it as a sequence.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.820
 - Mm-hmm.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.500
 - And that's just not there now in the Mark II,

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.140
 and it's like, okay, you're actually losing some

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.820
 pretty important features by going to the Mark II,

00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.820
 in my opinion.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.540
 - That's what I just realized with the machine drum too,

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.740
 I could just sequence it from the rhythm now

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.100
 that it has MIDI out.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:05.940
 - Yeah.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.780
 - Use probability there.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.620
 - Yep.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.180
 - 'Cause if it's got the good MIDI in spec.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.460
 - And sequencing it is fucking breeze, man.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.300
 Like I hate--

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.140
 - Oh yeah.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.820
 - I hate menu diving, and you know,

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.340
 on all the electron machines I've always hated

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.380
 going into that MIDI config page.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.220
 You know what I mean?

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.020
 And like, but with the machine drum,

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.380
 I forgot how simple it is.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.220
 It's like, okay, you're gonna accept clock,

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.180
 you're gonna accept program change,

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.260
 you're gonna accept note data, that's a wrap.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.100
 You know what I mean?

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.020
 It was like pretty straightforward,

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.700
 and I was able to just start sequencing away

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.500
 with the tracker thought issue.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.220
 Basically every track on the machine drum

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.860
 is associated with a whole note,

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.940
 starting at C3 and going up.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:47.220
 So you just send it note data,

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.780
 and you're triggering each machine.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.860
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.140
 - Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.140
 So I can essentially program every track on there

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:02.900
 if I wanted on a single track in the tracker,

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.020
 by with the note sequences,

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.980
 it would get a little chaotic, but it could be done.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.980
 - You don't have to do it pretty quickly.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:09.820
 - You don't have to at some point,

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.100
 but like you could do it.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.500
 So like, if I wanted to do that live, for example,

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.500
 I could essentially just have an entire

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.500
 track on the poly end handling the machine drum,

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.980
 and all the other tracker channels doing tracker stuff.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.820
 You know what I mean?

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:26.660
 - Yeah, it'd be cool.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.540
 - Hell of a setup.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.380
 - Yeah.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.900
 - Do you use the control all machines much?

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.740
 - No.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.580
 - Yeah.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.420
 - I never did.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.460
 And so far I haven't had any reason to again,

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.060
 because I've never really wanted to perform

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:41.900
 with a machine drum,

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.300
 it's always been a studio tool to me.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.780
 And I've never really wanted to sit there

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.340
 and tweak out on it.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.420
 Maybe if I had one of those,

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.700
 what is it, like the micro command

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.540
 that was ever called?

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.380
 - Mini command.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.220
 - Mini command, that's it.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.420
 Something like that,

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.660
 to open up that type of shit a little more,

00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.500
 or like a,

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.180
 what is it, like a fader fox type of interface,

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.700
 just have some sliders and shit to work with.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.860
 And maybe I would care more about them,

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.980
 but yeah, I've never really messed with those.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:13.700
 - Do you want a half broken BCR 2000?

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.540
 - No.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.540
 - I can't, what do I have to do with that studio?

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.500
 - Do you want to just have,

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.340
 I was the US distributor for the mini commands,

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.620
 I'll let you borrow mine.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.460
 - Oh, you have one?

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.300
 - Yeah.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.140
 - I got it.

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.580
 - I might have two, I'll check.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.500
 - Dude, even when you used to use those,

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:35.860
 I didn't fully understand what they did.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.460
 - I remember you tried to explain to me,

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.660
 and I was just kind of like,

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.740
 (mumbles)

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.900
 - I didn't know, like,

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.540
 it was like, so good,

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.700
 'cause I'm an idiot.

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.700
 What the fuck do they do?

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.540
 - It's a good question,

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.300
 'cause on the outside of it,

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.700
 it's just an Arduino that you can program to do anything,

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.060
 that he made some hardware that's specific for that,

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.380
 and he made some libraries

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.900
 that make it easier to work with the machine drum.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.140
 But the thing that was specific that he built into,

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.460
 it was really about looping with that device,

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.500
 and making it so you could have it

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.220
 trigger the RAM machine,

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.060
 that's what it was, right?

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.100
 Use the way RAM machine and just have it like,

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.540
 dude looping,

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:14.140
 and you could have it start and stop the loop perfectly-ish.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.380
 - What do you think about the looping?

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.180
 - Like, almost like a doctor track in a way.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.380
 So you could use that RAM machine buffer

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.580
 to loop like the whole output of the machine,

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.020
 and chop it up. - The mini-plan is

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.340
 recording audio?

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.700
 - No, it's sending the MIDI to it in such a way

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.460
 that it's manipulating the RAM machine,

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.940
 and he even got Electron to change

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.020
 some of their MIDI spec to accommodate this at the time,

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.140
 so that you could trigger those RAM machine

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.860
 recording on and off-states,

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.660
 and you could sample from internally within the machine.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.900
 - Oh, for the inputs on the machine drum.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.020
 - Yeah, interesting.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:46.860
 - Okay.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.420
 - Or like, no, just to do like,

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.980
 it could sample the output.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.340
 That's how the RAM machines worked like,

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.140
 you could have it tap from the output of the device,

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.460
 and just record what was going on in the output.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.300
 - Weird.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.180
 Yeah, so like,

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.940
 - There were the ROM machines and the RAM machines.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.540
 The ROM machines where you just put your samples

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.820
 play back in the RAM machines where you could do the loop.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.340
 This just made it easier to work with the RAM machines.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.060
 - See, I never fucked with the samples on a much to be given,

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.980
 which is why I have such limited understanding of them.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.340
 - 'Cause it's kind of a pain in the ass,

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.740
 which is why he made the thing to be like,

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.460
 "Oh, so I can use this live."

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.700
 Like, in his use case, I think at the time was,

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.340
 sample what's going on so I can offload the machine,

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.860
 kind of like I'd do with that boss 505.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.660
 So I can like edit something else and then go back.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.980
 - Interesting.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.220
 - Oh yeah, and he would persist the RAM machine.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.060
 That was the trick.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.540
 You could switch patterns on the RAM machine

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.460
 would still go and be reflected in the next pattern,

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.980
 'cause you only had one buffer.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.380
 So you could loop what you were doing,

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.300
 go to the next pattern, keep that loop playing,

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.900
 and then build up sequence too,

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.220
 which you couldn't do before the mini command.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.220
 'Cause it would have been like weird SISX,

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.780
 and he got some SISX stuff added.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.500
 - It's not at all what I thought those did.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.180
 I thought they were adding additional MIDI control.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.260
 - It does that too.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.340
 That was one of the other firmware.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.300
 The main one was the looping and the other firmware,

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.500
 which was just adding control for the delay,

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.540
 which was super useful,

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.620
 'cause you could just manipulate the delay parameters

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.340
 without having a current effects manual.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.820
 - Okay.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.540
 - So I would use that one a little more.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.740
 - 'Cause you had the effects that are kind of buried.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.660
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.620
 And that was just more SISX too,

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.100
 'cause I don't think there were CCs for the,

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.300
 I don't know why, for like the delay time.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.180
 - I haven't looked into CCs yet,

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.900
 which is something I need to look into

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.140
 with, you know, to really utilize the tracker

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.100
 to sequence it more.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.260
 I did with the model sample,

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.140
 or I'm sorry, the model cycles,

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.820
 I was sending that thing both MIDI data

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.460
 and CC data from the tracker to that,

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.780
 and it worked out really well.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.780
 It was pretty cool.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.620
 - Yeah.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:46.940
 - Haven't even got that far with the machine draw though.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.500
 - I don't even know if it's far from here.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.180
 - That firmware added the CC shit, I think.

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.020
 - Okay.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.020
 - That X.04, 'cause before that,

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.700
 I think it was mostly SISX.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:55.540
 - No, that's fine.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.980
 - That was the main thing of the mini command,

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.420
 was like SISX translation to CC, or vice versa.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.420
 - Interesting.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.580
 - That was one other thing it would do.

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.740
 And this is a long time ago, so I barely remember it,

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.580
 but I still have the big box in my basement

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.220
 that like all that shit came in.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.740
 - Yeah, I knew you had involvement with it.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.620
 And I remember you explained to me back in the day

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.700
 when you still had a machine draw,

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.500
 what they did, and that one was,

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.620
 and I think they worked for the Mono machine too.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.620
 - Yeah, they eventually, someone--

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.180
 - I remember, I think that's what we were talking about

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.180
 in the first place.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.260
 - Someone took it over now,

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.340
 they have like a super version of it,

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.020
 which uses like hardware you can actually find

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.180
 and does more stuff.

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.780
 I think it actually may be,

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.380
 he might have even done his own

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.540
 turbomitty implementation too.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.660
 He was one of the few,

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.500
 'cause you can't get those,

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.740
 apparently super rare now.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.180
 - I don't have it, the guy that I bought,

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.140
 the machine drum from did not include it.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:48.980
 - Yeah.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:52.140
 - So I don't think I'll be trying to upload

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.980
 any custom samples to mine any time.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.580
 - Any time sample without it.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.420
 - I definitely did it before I had one,

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.460
 but it took like a half an hour

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.340
 to send like two mags of data to it or something.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.500
 - Yeah, I don't have the patience for that.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.340
 And again, I haven't really fucked with samples

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.860
 much on the machine drum itself.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.020
 The magic for me is the synthesis on that thing.

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.860
 - Yeah, with the machine drum, I agree.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.140
 If I need samples in the drum machine,

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:20.380
 I have my thras or I would just buy like a model sample

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.380
 or something, - Yeah.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.780
 - Pair it with the machine drum, probably.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:24.980
 - I totally agree with that.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:28.500
 - Even that RAM machine stuff was kind of flaky,

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.980
 like the looping or it would click

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.860
 and it was just like, it wasn't the jam.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.020
 The Octrotract did it better, but not really.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.460
 - You're gonna be getting one, aren't you?

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.100
 - Oh yeah, you're gonna be doing it.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.700
 - I don't even wanna see you.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:44.700
 (laughing)

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.300
 I just, I don't wanna be around it.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:50.540
 - I will at some point be like,

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.020
 just let me use it for a couple of minutes

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.900
 to see if it's gonna go.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:55.740
 - It's charming, man.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.380
 I still like the interface on it.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.420
 - I spent so much time with one of those.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.260
 - I know you did.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.700
 - Like a lot of time.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.660
 It was all I used for a lot.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.260
 - I'm still surprised you don't have one.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.100
 You know what I mean?

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.860
 I mean, you got the rhythm and shit and you have for a while,

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.860
 but yeah, like when I think

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.700
 of a machine drum or Octrotrack or even an MPC,

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.300
 like you pop up in my head like a medium.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.380
 - I don't have a medium.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.260
 - Yeah, I mean like.

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.260
 - No, if they weren't like, it's just crazy.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.180
 I've been looking at the prices on Reaver.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.180
 - Yeah, it's a little insane.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.380
 - You got a good deal for sure.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.340
 - Yeah.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:30.180
 - Yeah.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.460
 - That was a lengthy electron corner.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.300
 - It was?

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.500
 - No, it was, it was fantastic.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.220
 And it was generally positive.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.540
 This was not our normal corner.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.780
 - Well, you can quiet for a while Dave.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.340
 Why don't you take the mic?

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.700
 - I mean, I got nothing.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.860
 I have no specific corner.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.460
 This is just me in the middle of the room,

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.220
 maybe sitting on a stool.

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.900
 - Maybe you need an Erica corner.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.500
 You've got maybe the most Erica gear.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.940
 - It could be an Erica.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.900
 And I'm a stand for Erica.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.580
 Like I, you're a fan of all the stuff they have.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:02.420
 They've done.

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:07.580
 This is weirdly like, depending on where you are,

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.380
 really exciting or really boring.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.980
 The Matrix mixer.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.980
 Him just popped out of nowhere.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.300
 And within like an hour of like looking at reading

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.060
 what it did, there's one video out there.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.900
 So this is exactly what I need.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.740
 Or did it right there.

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.820
 - That's literally what it's called, right?

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.220
 Like the Erica Matrix mixer.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.660
 - Yep. - Doesn't have a fancy name.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.500
 - Oh no.

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.340
 - Had no hype.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.380
 It just appeared.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.860
 - Zero hype. - It dropped.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.060
 - Absolutely just out of the blue,

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.460
 ninja release.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.900
 And it was weird too, it was around the time

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.180
 of the LXR2 hype.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.860
 So they were like, I don't know if it came out before

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.060
 or was gonna come out.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.820
 But like the videos for the LXR2 and like already come out

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.260
 there was like basically like excitement for that.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.020
 And then, which I was like, yeah, that's cool.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:56.020
 But like I just be lined over to the weird little Matrix mixer

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.980
 thing that they did.

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:02.980
 So it's a 16 by 16 grid of 16 in 16 outs.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.980
 The back has dedicated quarter inch stereo out pair

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.180
 and dedicated quarter inch stereo in

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:18.020
 that are normal to the first two ins and the first two outs.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.900
 So if you, you know, basically to plug those in,

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.740
 they were right up with Sarah.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.500
 And it's really simple to set up.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.420
 You've, you just have two knobs,

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.980
 one for scrolling left to right.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.060
 The other one scrolls up and down.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.460
 One, and they're both you push in.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.340
 The one you push, it just turns it on and off binary.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.820
 The other one is an attenuator.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.540
 And it's got multiple levels of attenuation

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.940
 and you cycle through them.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:48.140
 - So this is exactly like their pin matrix on the centrix.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.300
 - That is exactly what it is.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.820
 It even says in the manual that was like,

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.660
 this was both influenced by and because of the work

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.700
 they had done with that.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.860
 You can save a number of presets,

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.900
 bounce between them real easily.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.660
 There's like random and you've got control over what random,

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:10.420
 like what random does.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.980
 It solves a shitload of problems.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.060
 You can, I mean, again, it's, your rack is modular.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:21.060
 So like you can have ins, be audio rate, modulation rate,

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.980
 you know, hitting random and just having the whole thing

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.540
 just sort of reconstitute itself

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.580
 and make these new connections.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.020
 - Yeah. - Absolutely a blast.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.620
 - Yeah, you can like set the square

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.380
 that you wanna have randomized.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.220
 - Yeah, that's cool. - It's not just cool

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.060
 and it's just a matrix so you can be like,

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.540
 just give me the top four.

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.540
 - Yeah, it's kind of like a big daddy version

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.940
 of the WMD.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.420
 - Shit, what's it called?

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.380
 - Sequential switch. - Yes.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.300
 - Oh, yeah. - Matrix.

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.460
 - SSM, yeah, sequential switch matrix.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.460
 - Yeah, that guy. - Yeah.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.780
 So essentially like that is much bigger.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.220
 - Yeah, you can, 'cause you get those presets

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.940
 and you can program change through the MIDI program change

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:00.780
 which is pretty cool.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.740
 And you get like the whole grid of presets

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.820
 which is almost too much.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.420
 And it's DC coupled and buffered.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.580
 So like you can, I love it just for like,

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.220
 volt proactive, put it in there.

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.940
 And it's so easy to like, even,

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.860
 I like when I go back to use it, it's not confusing.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.700
 I'm like, oh yeah, you're the volt proactive

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.700
 and you go out of H and you're going there.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.380
 So it's like really easy to like get familiar with it again.

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.540
 It's not like a big mess.

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.380
 - Cool.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.860
 - Oh, and yeah, and one thing I didn't mention

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.260
 about the rhythm, I've got the quarter inch out

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.540
 on the back just going to the rhythm CV input

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.540
 which is fucking awesome.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:37.380
 - Oh, I was like just take any modulator from the modular

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.220
 send it to the rhythm.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.300
 - Forgot it has CV and--

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.420
 - Yeah, which is huge.

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.180
 Gets around the second LFO thing.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.660
 It makes it a little nicer.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:44.860
 At least you've got like two other things

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.900
 you can send to stuff for sound design which is tight.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.100
 - Yeah, but now it's like, you know,

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.420
 sort of like the central mixer for all of my stuff.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.900
 Now it's just kind of sitting in the middle there.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:56.940
 And I mean, the obvious being able to write route

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:57.900
 for feedback looping.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.820
 - Yeah, that was not the one next question.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.660
 - Yeah, it's, yeah.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.540
 - I'd like to hear a little bit about that.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.300
 - I mean, it's perfect for that.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.340
 I mean, you have the four levels of attenuation

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.740
 so you can sort of, you can't dial it in exactly

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.020
 what you want from the attenuation,

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.380
 but I mean, you still have pretty good control over it.

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.220
 - That's what concerned me because I mean,

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.740
 feedback patching, mixing I should say,

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:22.020
 really sensitive, you know what I mean?

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.980
 Like you gotta feel that out and I didn't see

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.860
 if you would be able to dial in carefully enough

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.660
 to do proper feedback patching on there.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.500
 - Yeah, you're saying it's enough?

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:35.980
 - It's, see, our version of proper might be different

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.300
 'cause for me, I've had--

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.980
 - Just being able to like fine tune it, you know what I mean?

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.820
 Like some feedback, you know, it's so touchy.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.540
 Sometimes just a hair to the right is,

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.300
 oh, too much is going off the rim.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.780
 - It begs for a bank of input attenuators

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.940
 'cause that solves it all.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.020
 And in some ways like with the size of the box,

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.140
 I guess they might have been afraid

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.580
 to make it more expensive.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.420
 - Sure.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:56.860
 - Or like it's buffered and they don't want to have people

00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:00.820
 like, you know, have that fuck up the buffering circuit at all.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:04.020
 I don't know if that's the case or not, but yeah,

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.420
 it kind of begs for like input attenuation.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.340
 Gotcha, okay.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.620
 For feedback purposes.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.240
 - But it hasn't really, I've had pretty good success

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.780
 with the feedback the way it is now.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:14.620
 - Fuck yeah.

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.820
 - Also having random and then making those connections

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.660
 that I didn't necessarily think of right away.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.260
 And now I'm like, oh, that was a good idea.

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.300
 Thanks, machine.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.060
 - I'd love to like I'd seem like I use it in chunks.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:27.100
 Like these first four will just be like fancy buffered molds

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:27.940
 basically.

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.700
 And then the next like four will be feedback shit.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.220
 And then two more for the rhythm.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.860
 They're kind of always at like one, two,

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.780
 just to use those quarter inch outputs.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:38.380
 So it's kinda, I like how you can do like different shit

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.620
 with it very easily.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.700
 - I'm tempted to check one out.

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.540
 - Yeah.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.380
 - I didn't even know it was out yet.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.220
 And you guys already had them on pre-work.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.140
 I was like, damn.

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:46.980
 Okay.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.740
 I need to look into this more.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.060
 - Seven out of chance.

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.860
 - Yeah, we both latched on to that announcement.

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:53.260
 It was the LXR2 came out

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.140
 and we both saw the Matrix mix.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.820
 - Ah, fuck.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.300
 - Yeah, it just solves a lot of problems.

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:01.900
 And I think they executed it almost flawlessly.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:02.740
 - Yeah.

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.820
 - Oh, and the other thing too is I used it for video

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.620
 and it works perfectly fine.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:10.300
 - Yeah, I was really excited about being able to take

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.620
 someone like, you know, I don't have four prismatic rays.

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.060
 I don't have, you know, like it's one of those things

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:20.620
 where like I have a pretty small set of video modules

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.420
 and being able to take that and kind of like,

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.860
 okay, now you're being routed here.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.260
 You're now being copied again and routed out

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.060
 as a different colorizer.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:31.540
 But now it, that version of the colorizer

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.340
 is gonna then be mixed with this LFO

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.340
 or that's now going to the staircase

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.260
 and having like these were routing options

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.740
 that I could have with, you know,

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.660
 a bunch of cables and a bunch of attenuators

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.900
 and a bunch of molds.

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:44.740
 - Yeah.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.500
 - Recreated that, but it would have taken forever.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.980
 This now and also it limits the experimenting

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.140
 that you can do with it.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:52.740
 'Cause you're like, okay, I spent an hour

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:53.820
 and I set all this up.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.140
 Well, it didn't work.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:55.980
 Shit.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.420
 Now having all of these sitting in there

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.540
 and just kind of like mapping them out

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.180
 and making those connections in the Matrix mixer

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.500
 allow for just so much more faster experimenting.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.420
 So yeah, for video artists out there that are listening,

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.100
 I recommend if you just, you want it for that.

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:12.860
 - Yeah, and it doesn't give a fuck about the volt difference.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:13.700
 - Not even a volt.

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.500
 - It's just to send what you send in out.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.380
 - Exactly.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:17.380
 - Yep.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:20.020
 - I like that they made it kind of simple.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.500
 'Cause I've had a few other, like the maze I had

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.700
 from livestock electronics and sold that on

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.700
 'cause it was just too much of a head fuck to use.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:29.940
 I had some cool features.

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:32.220
 And then like we were, the WMD SSM

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.060
 has always been interesting.

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:35.340
 - I don't think I'd, I don't think I want to take

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.780
 the Matrix mixer out.

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.340
 I think it is for just at home.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.180
 - Yeah.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.900
 - I don't know how well it would really work live.

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:43.380
 - That's the stuff that folks in my head

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:44.460
 when they even suggest like,

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:45.980
 oh, you could build like a whole performance

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:47.660
 so that you have this one patch

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.300
 that you're just mutating with the Matrix mixer.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.300
 - I don't know if that sounds like a good time to me.

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.820
 It just kind of does my head in.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.620
 I don't know maybe other people are different I'm sure,

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:58.620
 but I don't want to try to make that work.

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.140
 I don't want to be limited in that way.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.900
 Give it up a lot of decisions at that point

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:05.260
 that I don't really want to when I'm making stuff.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:06.500
 - If anyone's listening in,

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:09.900
 - You put your eye and you're on the fence.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.140
 I see you jump over the fence.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:11.980
 - Yeah.

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.460
 - It's ridiculous.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:14.860
 Love it.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.220
 - Was anything else for electron?

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.140
 I mean, I'm sorry, for Erica,

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.580
 what were we calling this?

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:21.740
 - The Erica corner.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:22.620
 - Maybe we have a corner.

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.740
 I mean, there's other areas.

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.140
 - Erica breakfast, Erica.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.140
 - Erica breakfast, Nook.

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:27.980
 I love it.

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.500
 That's all I have for the Erica breakfast, Nook.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.660
 - Yeah, Sam.

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.660
 - You don't have too much else.

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.340
 Those are my two main things.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.340
 - I had the trip take on my list.

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.420
 That's the only thing else.

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.660
 I can dip into that a bit.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.140
 - Yeah.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.380
 - Absolutely not.

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.780
 - Okay.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.620
 - All right, fine.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:46.460
 - All right.

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:47.460
 - Trip, trip ticket.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:50.060
 - The SSF trip tick.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:51.940
 We mentioned--

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:55.260
 - That's a reference to like the AAA trip tick, right?

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:56.260
 - What?

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.660
 - Trip ticks.

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:58.500
 - Trip ticks.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.820
 - It's not a reference to that.

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:00.660
 - It's definitely a reference.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.580
 - Tigertron live from the garden.

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:05.500
 - What?

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:09.580
 Like the trip to RTJ live from the garden?

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:10.420
 - No, something in like--

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:11.260
 - The panel artwork.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.980
 - Like the thing like AAA would do

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:15.820
 where you would say like,

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.820
 I want to go from here to here.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:20.940
 This is the days before, you know, navigation

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:25.260
 and your Tom-Tom's and your map quests and what have you.

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:26.740
 And you would get a trip tick.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.500
 And it would tell you, you know, where to go

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.260
 and how to get there.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.740
 - Sure they did grandma.

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:34.540
 (laughing)

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.420
 - Is it when you'd go on a trip

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.860
 and if you didn't do it enough time

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:41.300
 they would put ticks on you and give you Lyme disease?

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.460
 - So I even looked it up.

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:44.460
 - Uh-huh.

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:48.820
 - And AAA, the first thing you AAA from their own website,

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.220
 why AAA trip tick is the ultimate road trip planner.

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.140
 - Well I'll be damned.

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.140
 - That's what it does.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.980
 - This man speak of the true, true.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.580
 - Neither of you have A, you didn't believe me.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.700
 Why would I make that up?

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.660
 And B, you've never, you didn't have a trip tick.

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.220
 You didn't travel via?

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.780
 - Never, I've never heard of such a thing.

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:07.700
 - You haven't even heard of this?

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:08.540
 - No.

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.840
 He's right, of course.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.260
 - Wow.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.620
 - A trip tick.

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:15.460
 - Yeah.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.420
 - And that's what, I assume that's what this model's

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.820
 named after.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.300
 - Maybe it is.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.700
 - So that's super important that we get the answer

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.980
 of that before we move forward, but I would say

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.140
 maybe we could move forward.

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.660
 - I thought it was a playoff of like the fact

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:30.980
 that it's three major circuits

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:35.500
 and it was also a collaboration of three people.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.340
 As we've discussed in past, it was steady state fate

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:43.020
 in collaboration with Derek Basic and Boyz Noise.

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:43.860
 - That's three.

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.460
 - So that's three, that's trio.

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:49.300
 So I'm thinking trip is short for like triple.

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.300
 - The tri.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.140
 - Tri.

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:52.980
 - Three.

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:53.940
 - Yes.

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:55.260
 - Triangle, three ankles.

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:56.100
 - Right.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:56.940
 - Yeah.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:58.580
 - And the masons.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.900
 - We'll tell you where to go.

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:04.980
 - Are controlling the water supply.

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:10.940
 So the tick is what happens when your brain goes

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.340
 from all the chemicals in the water and the chemtrails

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.220
 and you start to get the twitches.

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.860
 It's a trip tick.

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.820
 See it's black and white Dave.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.300
 You just gotta read between the lines.

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.380
 It's all there.

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.980
 - I can't believe they're putting it out there like that.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.420
 'Cause normally the free masons are a little bit more.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.260
 - Hiding in plain sight.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.900
 - A little cageier than that.

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.620
 Yeah, that's too obvious.

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:34.420
 This is like an even shittier Dan Brown short story

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.580
 'cause what we had before.

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.700
 - While he was tripping too.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.100
 What was I talking about?

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:45.740
 - Yeah, that's it.

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:46.580
 - Yeah, that's it.

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.420
 - Yeah.

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:52.620
 - Previous episode mentioned it was a little pricey.

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:54.460
 Didn't seem all that appealing to me.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:57.180
 But I got one.

00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:58.620
 - But wait, here we are.

00:52:58.620 --> 00:52:59.460
 - Here we are.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.300
 - I can't believe it.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.780
 This never happened before on the show.

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:04.740
 - It never worked that way.

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.460
 - Never happened where we should on something

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:08.460
 and then later bought it and loved it.

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.780
 - It's very unusual.

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.140
 - I wouldn't say I love it.

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:11.980
 - Oh.

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:12.820
 - I like it.

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:18.660
 It feels a gap in my modular now that I've trimmed it down.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:25.700
 'Cause like I said, it's essentially three circuits, right?

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:29.180
 You got your filter, you got your distortion circuit

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:34.180
 and you got your delay slash comb circuit.

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:40.100
 Right, like individually, I would say the three of them

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.060
 are not that great.

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:45.620
 And then of course you got your high gain input VCA

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.540
 and high gain output VCA.

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:48.540
 - Right, okay.

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.180
 - To wrap it all up into a nice package.

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:55.260
 But individually I'm not too impressed

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.020
 by any of the three circuits,

00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:02.020
 but together they sort of form like a cohesive flavor

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.540
 of audio destruction that is kind of unique

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.300
 and I'm kind of enjoying.

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.460
 - Do you get the impression that this was designed that way

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:14.860
 that maybe not intended to be used individually?

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.380
 - I do, I get that vibe.

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.460
 I mean, that's the thing.

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:22.460
 Like it is a little expensive, you know, it's $400.

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.580
 Some people might look at that and be like,

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.740
 "Well, you know, I'm getting like three modules

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:27.700
 and one out of it.

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:28.940
 I'm, you know, I'm getting a filter.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:33.940
 I'm getting a BBD delay slash chorus slash comb

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:38.260
 and you know, I'm getting a multi-mode distortion.

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.540
 But like, you're not gonna really,

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:43.660
 at least I'm not gonna be routing into each of those things

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.140
 to try and get like, I don't know,

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:48.500
 use out of each circuit individually.

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.340
 You know what I mean?

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.580
 It's like it's kind of like an all-in-one approach.

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:55.100
 Like they all work hand in hand nicely

00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:56.880
 once you fine tune it.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:00.380
 - And what kind of control do you have over that fine tuning?

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.220
 - Yeah.

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.900
 - You get a decent amount of control.

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.180
 Not as much control as you would if you were to like

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:08.740
 just buy separate modules to do those things,

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:12.380
 which is kind of like, that was my initial thought too.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:16.180
 It was like, you know, I already know what delays,

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:20.300
 you know, module I want after or pre-distortion.

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:23.380
 I already know what distortion modules I have or want.

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.700
 I already know what filters I wanna use

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.300
 in that destructive manner.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.140
 You know what I mean?

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.300
 But like, I don't know, if you're trying to go

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.060
 for a more compact approach, like I am now

00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:35.020
 having separate modules to do all those things

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:37.700
 to just fuck up audio.

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:38.540
 - Be a lot.

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:41.220
 - Sounds like a dark matter situation in a way.

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.940
 - It's like all these things I'm--

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:43.780
 - Things I'm-- - individually or not

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:45.100
 especially in any way.

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:45.940
 - Exactly, exactly.

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:46.780
 - But here they are.

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.340
 - That's kind of what I hated about the dark matter too.

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.300
 It was like, well, I can already do this with,

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.460
 you know, XYZ modules that I have.

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:54.820
 Now that I have smaller rig,

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:57.820
 I'm starting to see the appeal of these more,

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.220
 you know, all in one solution, as I should say.

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:03.580
 And that's definitely what it's going for, you know.

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:06.780
 It's meant to be used with all of them together.

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.540
 And you can change internally how they're routed

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.180
 with a push of a button, which is nice.

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.020
 - It's cool.

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:15.140
 - Like, do you want to filter pre-distortion or post?

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.860
 You know, do you want the comb filter pre

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.020
 or post-distortion?

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:19.980
 - Is there any feedback options or is it--

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:24.980
 - There is feedback for the BBD circuit, like, regen,

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.900
 basically.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:29.300
 - So you can crank that up, and that's essentially like

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.060
 feedbacking, you know what I mean?

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:34.060
 But there is no internal like feedback loop routing

00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.380
 or anything like that.

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.140
 You have to do that externally.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:40.100
 But yeah, I mean, it's definitely a destruction module

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:40.940
 through and through.

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.140
 I'm enjoying it.

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.460
 It allows like creative sculpting in like a pretty

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:48.340
 industrial way, you know, which I dig.

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:49.180
 - Yeah.

00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:53.740
 Do you have a wide variety of tones and like,

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.340
 one of the problems sometimes you get with like

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:56.340
 something like that is,

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.380
 well, it does this and that's it.

00:56:58.380 --> 00:56:59.220
 - That's kind of it.

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:02.780
 I mean, you have a good amount of control.

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:07.300
 I feel like even though the distortion has two different modes,

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:10.180
 it still sounds similar overall.

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.020
 You know what I mean?

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:12.580
 You're not getting a lot of different flavors

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:14.180
 of distortion out of it.

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.660
 In fact, overall, I think the flavor and the tone

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:22.580
 is kind of muddy in a way that I don't like too much.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:26.540
 But I'm also very fucking particular and picky

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:30.060
 when it comes to distortion and over driving.

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:32.100
 - Which we've talked about a lot.

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:32.940
 - Yes.

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:36.660
 - So maybe it's the bee's knees for somebody.

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.300
 For me, I feel like the distortion leaves a little bit

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:42.820
 to be desired and I'm kind of using it in conjunction

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.060
 with some of my own personal distortions.

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:47.620
 But it does help add a little extra grit, you know what I mean?

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.060
 - Oh, is yours still using it?

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:50.140
 - The distortion circuit itself.

00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:50.980
 - Yeah.

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:51.980
 - At mild settings.

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:52.820
 - Oh my god.

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:53.740
 - Just to add a little bit of extra grit

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:54.860
 on what I'm routing through it.

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:59.860
 Mainly I just like using it in a modulating the shit out of it.

00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.860
 You know what I mean?

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:03.980
 Kind of fucking up audio that way.

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:08.380
 Like on drums, I feel like it might be a little too muddy.

00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.900
 I want to pre-filter before I route through it

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.540
 to actually get a little more surgical

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.940
 because it just kind of like, I don't know,

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.340
 the mid-range seems to get like really fucking muddy

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:20.340
 very quickly.

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:23.660
 And it's kind of like, if you're going to try to run

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:25.500
 more than like a single drum through it at once,

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.900
 it's going to slop up your mix a bit too much.

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:34.180
 Synth lines, bass lines, acid going through it,

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:37.420
 a little more enjoyable I think than drums.

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:41.780
 Yeah, this wouldn't be my go-to for drum distortion really.

00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:44.580
 Which is unfortunate because that's what I wanted it for.

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:45.420
 - Right.

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:51.940
 I almost, because of how muddy and like one flavor

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.940
 the saturation distortion is, I kind of find myself

00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:59.740
 splitting my path and using that as like,

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:03.580
 and you know, almost in like parallel processing

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:05.580
 with another, either a clean signal

00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:08.740
 or like something else that's being processed differently

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:09.660
 along with it.

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:10.500
 - Yeah.

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:14.180
 - Going through it 100%, you know, and only that,

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:17.500
 it's just, I don't know, doesn't please my ears.

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:18.900
 Yeah.

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:23.940
 - So it sounds like you have a real mixed feelings about this.

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:25.540
 - Yeah, I mean, like I said, I dig it,

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:27.060
 I could even see having a second one,

00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:30.500
 but it's, I feel like it's very specific.

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.900
 What I want to get out of it, you know what I mean?

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:36.180
 Or can get out of it, as opposed to being like,

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:39.260
 a very versatile fuck shit up module.

00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:44.100
 Like, even the BBD delay circuit

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:49.100
 it has two different timings, but there's still,

00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:52.380
 it's still very limited, even with the two different modes.

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:55.020
 It doesn't get as long as I would like to see.

00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.580
 I would love to see it being able to like,

00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:00.180
 push it into longer, almost like,

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.260
 glitched out time frames.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.860
 - Gotcha, yeah.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.100
 - For example, like the old flight of harmony

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.020
 sound shadows delay comes the mind.

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:12.540
 Like, like you were able to push that one far

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.900
 into like beyond what the chip was supposed to do.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.060
 You know, and it would get noisy

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.660
 and it was good for destruction purposes.

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.940
 And glitchy stuff.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.460
 And you could even push it further with CV, you know?

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:26.700
 And I would like to be able to do that with this,

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.460
 but it's still, even on the longer mode,

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.260
 it's still pretty short, in my opinion.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:36.220
 It's better for like tight, almost car plus strong,

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.060
 slash, corsy, flanger effects.

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:42.420
 But even in that regard, it's mono, you know what I mean?

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.820
 So you're not gonna get like,

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.460
 you're not gonna use this as a chorus module.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:46.860
 - Right, that's for sure.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:49.980
 - But at faster modulations,

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.420
 it's a nice touch to like help fuck up audio, you know?

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.260
 - Mm-hmm.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.100
 - Destructively.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:59.660
 The description says that the clock of the delay circuit

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.420
 can be voltage controlled.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.080
 I have yet to see how that's possible.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.860
 I didn't read the manual, mind you.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.980
 - So wait, is that like the CPU clock?

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:10.580
 Like this, like this EDSP?

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.420
 - Like this EDSP.

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:12.260
 - Like this EDSP?

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:13.100
 - Yeah.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.860
 - Or like what else?

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.100
 Like a chronoblob.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:17.940
 - Oh, right, yeah.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.540
 - You know where you can like actually block the delay time.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:23.100
 I don't see any input for that,

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.140
 unless you utilize a different input

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.140
 that's labeled as something else to do that.

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:28.740
 I have not seen that.

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:32.060
 Maybe that just means being able to CV the switch

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.340
 between high and low timing.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.940
 That's, yeah, I don't know.

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.020
 - Now that you look to see if there's a manual?

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:38.860
 - There is.

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.380
 I saw the link there for them.

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.700
 But I did not click it there.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.540
 - What?

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.740
 (laughing)

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.620
 - I would rather just, you know.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.620
 - Wow.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.620
 - Take a guess and feel it out.

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:52.780
 Yeah, I mean, overall I think triptych has grown on me a bit

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:54.220
 and I am enjoying it.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.980
 And the level's like really fast and easy dialing in

01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:01.060
 of specific flavored audio destruction.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.980
 You know, it combines a lot of the elements

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:08.860
 that I already over time patched together

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:11.660
 to get destructive results.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:12.500
 You know what I mean?

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.980
 Like the tight delay of filter that's capable,

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.420
 squeaking and nice distortion and out.

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.700
 A nice over-saturated VCA, you know,

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.540
 all that stuff, it's all there.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.540
 So, but it doesn't matter like personal preference,

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:33.260
 I guess if you can handle the the muddiness of it.

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:35.260
 I would have liked to have seen them use better op amps,

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:36.100
 I would say.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:36.940
 - Right.

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:41.780
 - Or different flavors of that distortion.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.500
 Like that circuit, you know,

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.620
 it switches between those two modes.

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:49.300
 We, which is what like one is,

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:53.620
 it seems to be like soft clipping or like the wave folding

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.340
 which it wasn't described as wave folding,

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:58.460
 but I remember what I recall it's similar to that.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:00.940
 - It's already a pretty expensive module.

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.940
 - Yeah. - Like that's,

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:05.380
 - I was reading, there's some dope for like older,

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:08.460
 octal VCA, it's like 4-H-P or something like that,

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:11.900
 but you can apparently like swap the chips out

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.700
 with almost like any VCA chip you want.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.460
 There's like an offset trim around the back,

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:18.180
 but you can like make them distort by default more or less

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.260
 than others. - Nice.

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.220
 - Still about the other day and like I couldn't,

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.540
 I didn't see one, but I piqued my interest.

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.860
 It'd be kind of cool to have something a little more flexible,

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.340
 like try different op amps, like fuck around.

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.980
 - You did that on my old dope for a 1-9,

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.300
 a 1-19 V envelope generator. - Oh, very good.

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:37.500
 - Yeah, I swapped out the chips on that,

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.900
 give it more headroom and a nicer crunch.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.220
 That's, yeah, I fucking hate muddy amps.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.020
 - Yeah, I do judge me. - Muddy delays.

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.940
 This one is pretty muddy and the distortion itself doesn't get,

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:53.660
 doesn't have that like metallic crunch

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:57.820
 that I love to get out of something labeled as a distortion.

01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:01.180
 - So you were looking at some analog voices.

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.860
 - I was. - Yeah.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.820
 - That 810 is definitely thumbs up.

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.820
 - Yeah. - System 8810.

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:08.420
 - Yeah, I was looking into that

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.220
 and I was looking into Atlantis again.

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:12.180
 - Oh, you're great.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.340
 - So why is that?

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:15.940
 'Cause we've talked in the past about maybe being done

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:19.340
 or like kind of over analog and its limitations.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:22.100
 So what is it that is changed in your mind?

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:23.620
 What's brought you back into it?

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.540
 - Not necessarily that it's analog.

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.380
 It's just I wanted like an all in one voice solution.

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.660
 'Cause I'm lazy lately.

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.460
 I don't really wanna go through the meticulous process

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.180
 of patching up a basic synth voice every time.

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.660
 And I don't have any all in one voice modules at the moment

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.980
 or even any desktop synths really,

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:48.300
 except for like my acid box and things like that.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:52.340
 Kind of, I don't know, I've been playing a lot with bass

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.940
 stuff lately and I just kind of wanted like a nice,

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:59.500
 not 303-ish, but like a good like kind of grimy,

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:04.460
 techno-y bass type of machine or synth voice.

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.220
 - And in the past, you've sort of stayed away from modules

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.700
 that were all in one voice.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.140
 You didn't really typically have that.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.220
 - 'Cause I always felt they're too limited

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.580
 and I was like, what's the point?

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.660
 - Modular. - Right.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.980
 - Patch up your own, but now like,

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.380
 now that I'm feeling creative and I've downsized

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:21.940
 my stuff a bit, it's more appealing to me.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:25.620
 'Cause I wanna dial in what I'm trying to achieve faster

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:28.260
 and take up less space in my rig

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.740
 because now I have two cases instead of three.

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.540
 So now I see the appeal of them more, you know?

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.500
 Whereas before they were kind of like,

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.940
 I just didn't really see it, you know?

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.340
 - I think you might have been like me

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.820
 where I was like so wave table focused for so long.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:46.820
 And now that I'm doing like more bass stuff

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.500
 with the modular and like thicker sounds,

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.900
 I'm really appreciating like, oh, analog oscillators

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.700
 are fucking great for that.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:56.180
 - Sometimes there's beauty and simplicity, you know?

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.220
 And when it comes to bass, sometimes less is,

01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.420
 more, you know what I mean?

01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.900
 You just want it to sound

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.580
 basic and solid.

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.380
 You don't need a lot of bells and whistles

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:07.500
 when it comes to bass lines stuff.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.460
 So yeah, definitely.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:12.580
 Whereas the digital stuff can get pretty crazy,

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.580
 pretty quickly, sometimes it's too much,

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.780
 it's not ideal unless you're making like some sort of like

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:22.340
 really techy bass dubstep type of shit, you know what I mean?

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.020
 - You're like, I was using the neutron orgone last night,

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:26.580
 which I like, oh man, it's awesome,

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.700
 but it can't really do bass very well.

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.740
 And I have the first one and there's maybe some technical

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:33.860
 reason why that is, but I was getting some good high end,

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.580
 but I couldn't get a bass out of it.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.140
 And then I'd swap some stuff around

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.940
 and I put the Pittsburgh voltage lab back in

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.140
 'cause I, that's one thing it does very well.

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:44.900
 And I was like, okay, yeah, like that oscillator circuit

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.780
 is great for that.

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:50.420
 So I've just been enjoying my analog oscillators a lot.

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:53.340
 - Yeah, I've been watching a lot of videos.

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:57.460
 And it's like, you know, especially the analog solutions,

01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:00.660
 the lip-zig version three just came out.

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:04.340
 And last time I was up in Toronto in Mug audio,

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:06.740
 I was playing with the previous version of that

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.340
 and I almost walked out with it.

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:09.180
 You know what I mean?

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.060
 I was really into it.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:14.060
 It just has like almost like an MS20,

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:17.220
 you know, type of distortion, like vibe to it.

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.500
 You know, it just sounds good and grimy and kind of,

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:20.980
 I don't wanna say the word lo-fi,

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.180
 but it's definitely not lo-fi,

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:25.300
 like it sounds fucking quality,

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.180
 but it also sounds just kind of...

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.100
 - It's not dirty.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.580
 - It's not really produced. - Yeah, yeah.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.980
 It has a little bit of spice on it, you know?

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:37.260
 It's got a distinct flavor.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:41.140
 And I feel like most of his stuff does, you know what I mean?

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.700
 But a lot of it is too much for me,

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.580
 both price-wise and machine-wise,

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.580
 but the lip-zig just looks kind of like

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:50.620
 just what I would want out of like a bass synth, you know?

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:51.500
 Is that standalone?

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:52.820
 That's not a model right, yeah.

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.060
 - Yeah, it's standalone.

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:56.260
 It's got its own sequencer.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.100
 - Oh shit.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.780
 - Yeah, it's like only eight step, I think,

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.700
 but you can do some nifty stuff with it.

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.820
 - So are you thinking about getting it

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.180
 or are you just looking at it with--

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:08.460
 - I'm just window shopping right now with, you know.

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:09.540
 - So short of that then,

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.140
 what would be something you would be inclined

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.340
 to actually maybe pursue?

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.980
 - Something probably half the price.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.180
 Like an Atlantis, for example.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.500
 - Yeah, you could see that.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:23.900
 - Yeah.

01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:28.740
 And I wish they didn't go so high in prices,

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:31.260
 but I really missed my 101.

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:32.100
 - Oh yeah.

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:34.380
 - I wish I had a 101 right now.

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:37.660
 So like, I would take whatever is as close to that

01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:39.860
 as possible, I guess, and still fun.

01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:44.860
 Like, I had the SH01A, which was cool,

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:47.260
 but I don't know, it was so tiny and I just didn't--

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.100
 - Yeah, very small.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.820
 - I'm just jiving with it really.

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:53.460
 I want something that, I don't know,

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.980
 I just want something a little more than that.

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:55.820
 - Yeah.

01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:56.660
 - And I can see that.

01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:59.900
 - Something you could like really beat someone to death with.

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:04.900
 Like a weapon, like Greg in the library with the 101.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.980
 That's how that game of clue ends.

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:08.500
 - Yes.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.580
 - So Nick, you were talking about the system 80 voice.

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.700
 - Oh yeah.

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.460
 - Have you put that back in 'cause it--

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:15.900
 - It's always been in.

01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:21.660
 - I didn't know I got, I have the Mark II of the 860,

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:25.140
 which is the Jove filter, what that's called now on the way.

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:28.340
 And so I was like, just refocused on that this weekend,

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.340
 playing the 810 'cause I was like,

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.580
 "Go to, I really need this around.

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:32.420
 "Could I downsize?

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:34.060
 "Could I swap something out?"

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:35.300
 And I would only do that, I think,

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.980
 if you could still get the oscillator that they sell.

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:40.780
 'Cause the VCA on it is like great, it's a VCA.

01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.540
 It's not the most attractive part to me.

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:46.700
 It does like two in mixing, but that's not like essential.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.300
 But the oscillator sounds fucking great.

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.900
 And I like all the stuff that I've ever recorded with it.

01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:51.980
 So it's kind of a keeper,

01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.460
 and I wouldn't be mad at having like two of those filters

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.460
 around too.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.820
 Even though the 810, like I said on a previous episode,

01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:59.220
 it's just low pass only.

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:03.580
 And I really was missing the high pass of the Jupiter too.

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.100
 So yeah, I'm psyched for that.

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.500
 But yeah, both of them, I've got spot right now,

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.780
 so I can just slide it next to it.

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:13.980
 And then the voltage lab is to the left of both of those two.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:17.060
 So it should be super nice analog row.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.580
 At the bottom of the manthes.

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.980
 - Well, yeah, I'm pretty psyched for it.

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:24.260
 - As of right now, I don't have any analog oscillators.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.100
 - Oh, no shit.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.340
 Yeah, everything's digital.

01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:27.940
 - I don't either.

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:31.740
 I think that might be why I'm kind of leaning towards one now,

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:32.580
 finally.

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:35.540
 And I kind of like the fact that if I had the Atlantis,

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:40.540
 I could also enhance it with routing and digital into it.

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:44.020
 - Yeah. - You know what I mean?

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:45.700
 To give it a little extra flavor.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.860
 - I had that Atlantis a while back,

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:51.580
 but at the time, I just didn't have the need for it.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.420
 And it felt like too big and too expensive.

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:54.820
 Yeah, it was a very brief period.

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.860
 It was when I was trying to find

01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:59.540
 a replacement to the 101.

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.340
 And it just wasn't there for me.

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:03.180
 - Yeah. - You know what I mean?

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:05.940
 But now, especially with how much 101 costs,

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.860
 I think it's acceptable.

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.540
 I would make do with it.

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.980
 - And did they do a Mark II of that?

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.260
 - Did they just change the panel, I guess?

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.060
 - Yeah, they just updated the panel.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:18.420
 And what I know, I don't think anything circuit wise

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.700
 has been updated with it since it's released.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.820
 And I think it's gone up in price as well over time.

01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:27.340
 I think it's about 650 now, something like that.

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:29.300
 - Is that new or is that just like, do at least,

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.380
 I mean at least it's looking. - No, that's new.

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:33.100
 Okay. - Can't find it used right now

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.660
 because of the new Mylar Melodies episode

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.580
 that just came out showing off the metropolis with it.

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:42.420
 Now, all of a sudden you can't get him a travel explorer

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.900
 in Atlantis, they're just gone.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.100
 - Shock. - Yeah.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:49.660
 But that was a good video.

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:52.060
 I think in the last episode, or maybe it was the one before

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:55.460
 that we did, I mentioned that he just kind of shills now

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:59.500
 more than he used to, but this was like Mylar's return

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.100
 to form, you know what I mean?

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:04.140
 Doing what I think he does best, and that's just jamming

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:07.660
 on IntelliJel Gear, making neat little techno acid jams.

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:08.860
 You know what I mean? - Yeah.

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.940
 - Which is essentially all that video was.

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.100
 You know what I mean?

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.900
 I mean, there was definitely a technical overview element

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.660
 of it, he explained some things and that was cool,

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:19.420
 but mainly it was just him while on out,

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:22.060
 making some decent modular acid, and showing off

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:23.540
 what he could do, and it was like cool.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:28.500
 Like that was, I think how most people came to know him

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.500
 in the first place was the original metropolis video.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:32.660
 You know what I mean?

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:35.380
 That was solid, so this was a good sequel to that.

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:40.100
 Megranity was strongly shilling for IntelliJel

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.740
 at the same time, who can blame him.

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:46.380
 They gave him a free metropolis, so whatever.

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.820
 - Yeah, that's hard to argue with.

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:51.260
 The last time the last year when there was a chip shortage

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:52.740
 that affected the 810, they were like,

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:55.260
 I don't know if I'm gonna do this module again.

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:58.100
 They were just gonna focus on the Jove, and that was it.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.820
 So who knows if they're gonna produce it,

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.140
 but yeah, I couldn't find any,

01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:05.780
 or even see any recent sold listings.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:09.100
 - Yeah, I think that's common with almost everything

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:12.220
 right now, like anything that I was like,

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.980
 oh, maybe I'll buy one, I go to look for it,

01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:16.060
 and it's just gone.

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.620
 - Yeah, just nothing to be fun.

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:22.140
 - This chip shortage is no joke.

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:25.820
 We were talking to Russ from Eveton Technologies

01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:29.180
 over the weekend, and he was having trouble sourcing stuff

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.420
 even for his range of stuff.

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:34.420
 - It was interesting to hear his take on it.

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:37.180
 - Yeah, I mean, from someone in the industry,

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.100
 shed a lot of light on things I wasn't aware of.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:39.940
 You know what I mean?

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:40.820
 - Yeah.

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:43.180
 - It doesn't seem like it's gonna be over anytime soon.

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.020
 (laughing)

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.140
 - Yeah, no.

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:46.900
 He was even having trouble talking about

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:49.540
 even doing like replacements, or like,

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.100
 changing the design, doing something different.

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:54.180
 Like that wasn't even necessarily going to solve the problem.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.420
 - You did mention possibly like a new Renaissance

01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:01.900
 for older school gear, and like desktop boxes

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:07.060
 that made a lot easier than using the super, super tiny

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:10.180
 components that most things rely on today.

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.700
 - Yeah, using those big chips that are actually still

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.340
 available, and maybe coming at them with a different idea,

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:18.820
 or coming with a different view,

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.060
 taking them on slightly differently.

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:24.460
 I hope he's not the only person who has that idea,

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.100
 and even if it ends up being like a bigger box

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:30.300
 because those parts and all of their,

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:33.260
 everything to design around them,

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.860
 is going to take up a lot more space,

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:37.220
 but if it's that or literally nothing,

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:41.620
 because the super small stuff just can't be done.

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:42.460
 - Yeah.

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:44.260
 - I'd rather have something going on.

01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:47.420
 - Yeah, so Intellio had to rev the Rainmaker

01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:50.980
 just because, so they could get a different graphics chip

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:53.580
 for the little display, and so they had to redo it

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:54.780
 just to accommodate for that,

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.980
 just so they could keep making them interesting.

01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:00.100
 And the, I want this thing, I'm not gonna get it,

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.460
 just because, but the fake devil fish from Barringer,

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.460
 that's been pushed out maybe until 2022 now.

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.300
 - Oh no, sure.

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.940
 - I saw, 'cause it was like coming soon, coming soon.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:10.780
 - Yeah.

01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:12.060
 - And I just saw something where somebody says

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:15.060
 one of the parts was maybe harder to get now.

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:15.980
 - That's the thing with Barringer,

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.900
 like they've made so many fucking announcements

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:18.980
 over the last couple years,

01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:21.260
 and like almost none of them have seen the light of day,

01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:23.260
 like we're still waiting for the ARP 2600,

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.020
 or the barps, I should say.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:28.140
 - Other companies, I mean, they're dealing with the shortage,

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:30.140
 or at least some kind of plan,

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:33.220
 'cause look at like Erika announced the LXR2,

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.220
 and the Matrix mixer, and they both came out.

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:37.620
 - With the announcement pretty much, yeah.

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:39.260
 They announced it, and then like days later,

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:40.820
 you were able to buy it.

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:42.620
 - Right, and so Barringer's just doing the opposite.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.460
 - Yeah.

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:46.700
 - Here's a million things that we'll never actually do.

01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:48.460
 - And I kinda hate that, 'cause if there's something

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.980
 that I, if the marketing works, and I end up wanting it,

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:54.940
 like it's not something, you know,

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:58.100
 I wanna act on that impulse, and impulse buy, right then.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:02.220
 - That's not like, I hate having to, you know,

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:05.780
 I don't know, wait, 'cause by then my interest will wane,

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:06.780
 and just whatever.

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:07.620
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:10.200
 (upbeat music)

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:12.780
 (upbeat music)

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:15.360
 (upbeat music)

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:30.360
 (upbeat music)

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.940
 (upbeat music)
