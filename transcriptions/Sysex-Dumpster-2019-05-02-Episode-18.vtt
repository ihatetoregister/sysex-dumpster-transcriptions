00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 [Music]

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 So, Muffwiggler, Mike McGrath of the Muffwiggur Forum, the creator, shepherd of all our weird modular fantasies in some way, passed away.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 And I think it affected me a little more than I expected at first, but it's a downer.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Yeah, I don't know under what circumstances it passed away. It doesn't really matter, I guess.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Just leave some questions now as to what's going to happen with Muffwiggler, the forum.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 I personally don't know. I've looked at Facebook and the threads on Muffwiggler, and I think his sister has taken ownership of it or something like that.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 I guess he left it to her in his will, so to speak.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 But what that means for the future of the forum, I'm not sure. I just know that there's a lot of people who have been using this as an opportunity to complain about the name and saying it's a good time to change it, and I'm like, how I don't understand why this would be a good time to change it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Also, make your own forum?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Exactly. It's like, do your own thing. This is Mike's legacy. He named it. I don't think anyone should be fucking with that personally.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 But yeah, it was hard to get any real information over the last week, because there was more people debating about whether or not they should be offended by the name than, you know, I guess, paying their respects.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 You know what I mean? That was a little frustrating to have to sift through it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 As much as I did sift through it, I saw a lot of people paying their respects, and that was cool.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Yeah.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Like when I joined Muffwigler, that was 2008, my member number is 244. We're up to 46,000 now.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Wow.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Yeah.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 You know, like, a lot of people still refer to Muffwigler as like, you know, a tiny little niche, you know, community, but it's definitely gone beyond that.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 So over the last few years, like, it's huge, and I think his passing, you know, it's going to leave a, you know, and it's going to have an impact on a lot of people.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 No, you know, whether they're just lurking on the forums or not. It's like, you have to acknowledge, you know, his impact on the synth community at large here.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 I mean, even just personally, as someone, I think I joined, you know, a little bit after you, Greg, but I've been on there for years.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 And I think my post count is like 10. Like, I never got to 100 to be able to sell because I just lurk.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Yeah.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 There's no way to describe how good the information I got from there was, even when it was like contentious, or people were arguing, or like it wasn't, it wasn't clear cut.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Just even those debates about these certain things, just sitting and reading those was like, there was no other way for me to get that in a way that would have gotten me from A to where I am now.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 It's something that is, it is dense. It is hard to get into. And if that was spread out over, you know, a KVR or any of these other sort of like existing forums and it had been relegated to some sub forum somewhere where there was three people, maybe just sort of bickering with one another.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 It wouldn't have been the treasure trove of just incredible information. And, you know, people sort of talking and bouncing back and forth.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 You get a sense of like, you know, some of these ideas came from people going, oh, I wish I did this and I wish I did that. And someone kind of like, those are all great ideas.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 And now I've just made a module and you can now have it because the manufacturers are, they were other people that were just on this forum and we're listening and engaging in this conversation.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 You had fans, you had users and you had manufacturers all in arms length in one another in a way that was, I don't see how you can recreate that in any other sort of way.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 And you still do too. You know, a lot of people like to reminisce about the wiggler of old, but I'm like, it's still there. There's still a lot of interesting people. There's still a lot of great minds that are on those forums and are active every day.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 It's just that there's a lot more noise now too because we have so many more people there. It's like, that doesn't take away from the positive stuff that's there.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 You know what I mean? You just got to kind of sift through the noise ratio a bit more.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 There's so much there. Like, if you want to learn about power supply grounding, like there's oceans of actual really good information on that forum if you want to search for it.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 I mean, even look at something like mass with like the sort of infamy of maths and it's like, I don't, you know, there's threads that started with, I have no idea why this is popular.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Why would anyone use this? What do I do? And then six pages later, you now have a ton of people going, well, this is how I use it.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Here's a video of this thing that I've done. And the original poster goes, yeah, right, I'm glad I didn't sell this because this is clearly an amazing module.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 And like that didn't just turn into, you know, either the path of your stupid, you don't know what you're doing.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Here's my chance to berate someone who doesn't know as much as me or, you know, the sort of like dense white paper that no one can use.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Like this sort of like that perfect like a lot of these threads and all these discussions end up being that sort of like perfect balance of like useful information, people being a smart ass, people being an asshole.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 But like at the end, there was this like this like these sort of useful artifacts that even if you're not engaged in the conversation, you can look at it and go.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Yeah, I'm learning, I'm learning a lot just by watching these people argue. Yeah.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 I kind of got burned out on forums like, you know, a long time ago, but Wiggler, Muff's, whatever you want to call it, the only forum that I've stuck around this long as a member of and been this active on for this length of time, you know, I mean, so I think that says something for sure.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 It has almost like the right amount of toxicity. Like it's not it's not saccharine. It's not sweet. It's not everyone's being very nice, but it's also not like everyone runs away because of it.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 It's almost like the like the toxin is a is an accent, a little drop of it.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 It's almost like you need it a little, otherwise you might be there a little too much.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 We've all had our times of being there quite a bit. I know I have. And now it's more of a still there daily, but it's not like it was.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Yeah, hopefully it continues on. Yeah.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 I'm not sure who's paying the bills at this point or where the funds are coming from or who's doing all the administration, but I know that for the overdue bill that happened right before my past.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 I know Synth Cube footed the entire bill. So I feel like there's enough of a community that people know the value and they'll support it because like that site should persist.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 It's like the hub for a lot of synthesis and electronic music information.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 So wait, what else is on our list?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Honeymoon phase over.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 Do you still love Zalk?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 I do want to say that all the interactions with the Yay cocks.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Zalk zooks.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 I don't care if they say it's supposed to be chaos.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Oh, yeah. So all the interactions with the Yalk was stellar. I explained what was going on. They asked me to try a few things. I did and said, "Hey, it's still broke."

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 And he said, "Cool, ship it." It wasn't fast because it's in Poland. That's not their fault.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 And I got it back and I have not had a single problem.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Knock on whatever the fuck this table's made out of.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 No matter what we say about how we feel about it, I have to say the interactions with the company and their support and them turning around and giving me one that works. Thumbs up.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 So I'm coming on the other end with two thumbs down.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 I would never buy another Zalk module no matter how much I like the Zadar because of the way that they treated me throughout that whole situation.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 I've updated a bunch of models with my audio interface, many audio interfaces.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 They pretty much treated me like a child and said that you need an audio setup that works. You've ruined this. You've taken the wrong approach. It's like, "Dude, it's a UAD Apollo 8 on a MacBook Pro. There's no real variance here. It's a single electric line going to the box.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Never had any issues. Don't have any electrical issues." Not the fucking interface, dude. You have some flaw in your modules. Honestly, the fact that they're update with the weird character, they've made a few little missteps with this update.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Oh yeah, we got the version name wrong on the firmware. We didn't know that this character was wrong.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Well, both of those proved to me that you didn't test your build at fucking all. You got it to work on a module and you said ship it. We're going to move on to the next thing.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 And you were not alone in that thread. It was just, it was like all kinds of people were having problems.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 To the point where there's now customer service in Pennsylvania that was close that they could ship it to, to deal with what they felt like were the annoying people that amped the levels up too high or did something wrong.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And it's like, "Now, first off, make a list of what you would expect people to do. Tell us what the average decibel level should be. Is it minus 10? Is it plus 4 dBU? What was your actual scenario that they updated it on?"

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Which I asked them and they never responded to. So, at that point, like, dude, it's a great module, but treat your users with some level of respect.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 I didn't really feel like I got that. I feel like they do kind of some janky software work. And I get it.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 You probably found a hardware flaw that you don't want to update. I totally get it. I know what that's like.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 It almost feels like there has to be because he immediately kind of ninja released a revision.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Yeah. Yeah. Which was a little suspect. They never said anything about it. I was like, "Oh, guess what? There's a 2019 version. Throw the OV that just bought this a month ago. Guess what? There's a new version that we're not talking about."

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And I've seen some other people on Muff's that were like same scenarios. Look, I just kind of got stuck in this. I don't know. This thing keeps bailing after it updates multiple packets of data. Why would it stop?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Yeah. Warp off. The levels were right. It was the, you know, eh, help your users out a little more.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 I'm glad I waited and watched this unfold online and also between YouTube. It made me realize like I just didn't want to fuck with it. I was like, "I want this update, but I ain't fucking around." So I just sold my Zadar and went and bought another one.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 It was already updated from them, you know, and lo and behold, it was a revised module. It wasn't really where existed.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 With the correct version, like whatever 1.2 on it. It's like, but updating the other ones bricked it and you admit that, but this new one worked fine with the same process. That's pretty fishy.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 So calling you out loved the module, but kind of fucked the way you approached that personally. They didn't even talk about the calibration process that you pretty much need to do in the firmware upgrade procedure until people bitched on the forum and they were like, "Oh, yeah, you're good at calibrating."

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 That was the final straw for me. I realized that like, I didn't want to fuck around updating and having a potential problem with a module that I was kind of already becoming dependent upon for my shit. And secondly, I saw the calibration and I was like, "Nah, I don't want to mess with all this."

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 I'm to the point where with updates period, I would rather just send my module to someone to do it. Control mod or Detroit module or someone nearby, have them do it and just ship it back to me.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 I can live without it for a few days if I don't have to go through painstaking processes of updating and calibrating every digital module in my rig at this point.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 There's just no fucking standard for it. Every module through every manufacturer updates in a different way, even if you're doing the audio interface for Zadar.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Mutable does the same thing, but it's completely different for their shit. It's like everything you have to have a certain procedure or a certain tool or connector like I needed for the Harvest Man stuff.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 You needed to pick it to adapter and it had to be a certain version. It's just like, I'm so sick of updating shit. My rainmaker is still on the original firmware, because I don't even want to consider messing with that thing.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 You need a VM for that? Well, I do because I have a Mac, so there's a whole step. It's crazy. I almost want to just sell it and buy one that's updated.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 It's like less of a hassle. It's like the only one for all this shit. I've had it. It's really good. It's the ER301. You just put a zip file in an SD card and put it on there and he's got a whole process.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 It's very foolproof. I've updated it dozens of times now with each release and never an issue.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 The audio damage sequencer one was like that. It had an SD card on the back. You pop the module out, took the card out, slapped it in a computer, copied over the new firmware, threw it back in the module, powered it on. It detected it. Done deal.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 I'm like, that was great. And then if you want the NIN expander, turns out you've got another firmware update you're up against.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 I'm not going to get that. I was hoping I could make my own two HP one because three HP can't really deal with that right now.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 And I don't want those fucking buttons either. I don't need buttons for triggering.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 The only thing I'm a little worried about too though, and we talked about this in email, is I get the feeling that that's going to be the straw that breaks that camel's back.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 It's already got to be pushing that hardware to the limit. And the second one of those NIN inputs that I put in, I just see that thing just freezing up and going up.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 And what's scary? They're stuck now because there's no more memory whatsoever. So if they have a fix, you're going to have to cut something or do something creative to try to get that to work.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 It does feel complete at least though. The newest firmware, there's nothing I can think of that it needs. It feels solid.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Going back to the original question you asked, the answer is the honeymoon over maybe, but I've settled into a very comfortable marriage with NIN expander.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 It's great in the regard that you can easily get out of it what you would expect from a digital envelope.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 It's super easy, but once you go beyond that, there's so much more to explore.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 It's really awesome. Greg, you posted a video where you're doing sequence stuff with it.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Using it to make our coagiation and stuff.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 It was one of those aha moments when I was, all to play was Zadar. What should I do with it?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 I was like, send it to the one volt octave and quantizer. I can't even remember that patch. It was basic, but I don't remember what I did.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 It was something between Zadar and Scales being triggered in different ways.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 I was gating the Zadar once every so often. It was a long gate.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Then I was hitting other gates to the Scales to create the note changes.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 It was a weird cycle. Then I had the trigger out of that going to something else.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 I can't remember with Zadar. It was a weird loop type of thing, but basically it was a modulated arpeggiation.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 It's not something you would typically get with a normal envelope.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 It was also on the list.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 As I pull out the mini log XD, which we described as for the listeners, this unboxing video.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 This is sexy, dude.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 I got the bag.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Slither bag.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 I got the bag. I didn't come with the bag. I was going to play it at a show. I did not at the last minute.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 For the price, I think I got it on sale. It was $6.20 or something like that.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Honestly, Fed synthesizers for a lot of years now. Access virus, all sorts of shit. This thing should cost twice as much.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Very happy it doesn't, of course.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 But, for voice, full analog poly. I actually love the fucking analog oscillators on it.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 If they made this in a module, I would get it.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 The sound of it, very close to the mini log, but there's some richness to it.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 That's kind of corny, but it sounds really fucking good.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 Didn't expect that. I expected it to sound okay.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 You know, like, analog 4. Did you ever have the analog 4 from Electron at all?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 That thing was anemic and thin as fuck, which I think they kind of updated that or something.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 I blame the filter, but you could bypass the filter pretty much, and it would still sound kind of nasal.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 When I looked at that square wave, the square wave is what I hated the most on the analog 4 on a scope.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 It was not a square wave.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 These ones sound ridiculous. That's part of it. You get two full analog oscillators.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 You get sync and ring mod. You get cross mod 2, which is really nice.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Pretty nice feature. Multi-engine, those where it's at.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 This is the main differentiator for this in the mini log, just the regular one.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 This one also just has a low pass filter, but we'll talk about that.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 There are some ways you can get around that.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 So multi-engine. At first, it was just oscillators you can upload, but it's actually oscillators.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Modulation effects, reverb effects, delay effects.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 All that code you can update and override.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Cool thing. You can find that best place to get all this info is a Reddit thread for the Pro-Log

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 for this synth because it'll load the same code.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 You can get a multi-mode filter effect for it.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 You can get high pass, band pass, and all that other shit, which is pretty cool.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 When I got the thing I played with it, it just comes with two built-in multi-engine effects.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 One of them is VPN. In a few days in, I found I put all the plats code on it.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 I bought a $20 oscillator with wave folding on it.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 It was getting another synth, basically.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 You could just sit there with plats code on it playing plats code in poly.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 It's fucking awesome. I actually hated the overdrive on this.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 The overdrive is kind of limiting. You get 0%, 50%, 100% overdrive.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 That's it. Yeah, exactly. Strange choice.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 I thought it sounded like shit on the regular oscillator models.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Then I got the plats going and I was like, "Oh, okay.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 No, there's some dirt in here."

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 So that was really cool. I haven't put any custom effects on, but you look at it

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 and they don't really clarify this upfront, but it almost looks like you only get one

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 effect at a time, right? But it's actually not that way.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 All this stuff is digital memory kind of.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 So you can just go to reverb and turn it on and turn it off.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Go to delay, turn it on, turn it off. You get everything simultaneously, basically.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 It sounds really good, too. The effects are very quality.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 You just get time and depth. You get two parameters, basically.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 The trick of this thing is, and the way, you know, plats obviously doesn't have just one knob,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 so you're like, "How do I get to the other parameters?"

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Well, you got to go to this edit mode and there's a menu you got to dive in here,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 and you can do some things like some of them have internal envelopes to modulate it

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 because you only get a full ADSR and then an AD and this LFO.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 That's fucking it. You got these destinations for it.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 This one's hardwired to amp for the full ADSR.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 That's your modulation.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 Aside from the two CV ends, which is fucking brilliant,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 and then you'll get some internal oscillation on some of this.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Anyway, you get a ton of presets on it.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Most of them sound like garbage, of course. Some of them are pretty good.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 But I love patching this thing. This is probably one of my favorite synthesizers ever.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 I've had it for a while. Like, I could probably get rid of a lot of stuff.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 The boil fell is kind of gone away.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 One of the main differences is you get this joystick with XY,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 and you can either just assign it...

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 You can CV the XY, or you can CV individual parameters.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 You can assign up and down to any parameter you want almost,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 but left and right are always going to be pitch bend to a degree.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Pretty interesting choices, but it's nice because this will just be like,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 "Oh, octave down real quick when you're playing it."

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 It's nice to play live if you want to just kind of pitch down a whole sequence or something like that.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Yeah, this sounds great. What are the downsides?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 So you notice you get...

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 I got a question.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Yeah, go ahead.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 This? Damper?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 That's so rare. It's actually a volume pedal input if you want to damper.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 How many fucking synthesizers have a damper pedal?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 I've seen people on gear sluts in other forms that are like,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 "Oh fuck, I'm a piano player that wants a synth.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 I will buy this thing because it has a fucking damper input on it."

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Yeah, because that's what I'm used to.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 It's like, "Oh, I don't think of things that way."

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 But one of the things that's kind of annoying is there's no octave switch for the multi right here.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 You were only going to tune this thing with your keys basically,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 and then everything else has to shift around it.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 It's kind of an interesting choice.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 I kind of wish they would have put some way to pitch that up and down.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 So you kind of got to do that with the keys and then just adjust these to suit.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 It's not the biggest deal.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 I think I've maybe looked at the manual once or twice.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 It's very easy to program.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 It's got a nice cord sequencer, just kind of a 101, but mono or cord.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 So I've sat there and just made sequences just recording it into here.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 And it's pretty straightforward.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 It's of course quantized to 16 steps and everything, but I don't know.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 I really like the thing. It sounds really good.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 Where's the dice and pepper buttons?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 There are no dice or pepper buttons in here.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 What does it have as far as special features go?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Things it doesn't have that the monologue does is the LFO rate will only go so high.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 Whereas one of the things that made the monologue nice was that it would go into really fast audio rates

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 and you could just treat it as another oscillator.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Does it hit audio at all? Or is it like?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 A little bit.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Yeah, I would say it probably goes up to like 2K.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Okay.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 Like that.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 So it's a lambiting, but it does the trick.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Are these your only targets for these?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Yeah, these are just the ones in the menu.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 These are your only targets.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 So to be honest, it's another thing.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 Like I generally like, they're generally like pointed this way.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 This is, I usually have the LFO in shape and the second EG on cutoff.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 You can assign these these, you're going to assign to anything, which is awesome.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Oh, that's a lot.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Another nice thing is like, it's not some weird process to put the new oscillators on.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 There's a nice librarian program.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 You can easily back up all your patches, throw third party code on there without having to like

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 how to do anything technical.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 I think they kind of fucking crushed it in a way.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 I really like it.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 I think the filter sounds really good.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 It's the model log filter, not the mini log one.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 It's a little beefier.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 It's only like 12 pole low pass.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 Really wish they made a desktop version.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 Yeah.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 The keys are all right.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 You know, for like mini shitty keys, I'm not a piano player.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 I don't like a digital in this 20-ish look.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Yeah, for sure.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Kind of nice look.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 It's burly.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 It's got these weird like, I remember the designer even talked about how much he pissed off the

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 channel engineers by doing this curved face plate.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 And they're like, dude, what the fuck are you doing?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 He's like, no, I kind of want it this way.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Yeah.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 It works for me.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 Yeah.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 I like it.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 It's got the micro tuning that FX twin suggested from the monologue.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Only the mini log and the monologue have that and the innovation base station now that

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 it has the FX updates.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 So you mentioned the analog oscillators.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 Yeah.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 What is on there for digital?

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 Is it like, do you get like two and two or something?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 Like, so you get this down here, which I forget.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 One of these is the variable phase modulation, which is kind of like FM.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 Okay.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.600
 I had the core prophecy, which I've had since I was like 17 years old, and it had variable

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.600
 phase modulation.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.000
 I feel like they ported some of that or something like that.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.600
 There's another one you get on board.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.000
 Then you get all these other different types of like, I forget exactly.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.400
 But it sounds even if you couldn't upload your own, it would be a fully satisfying and deep

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.400
 synthesizer.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.400
 I think the plaid stuff just takes it to like another fucking dimension.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.400
 Yeah.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400
 That's what I'm curious about.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.400
 Like if I didn't load anything on there and say I wanted to just disable the analog oscillator.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.400
 I've done that for many patches.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400
 Okay.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.400
 So what do you, what are you left with then?

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.400
 Oh, you're left with this multi-oss full poly and everything else.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400
 Okay.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.400
 So that's just like one variable oscillator?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.400
 Yeah.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.400
 So you get a mixer here for all your different like the two VCOs and the multi and it's just

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.000
 up to you how you want to use the three oscillators.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.760
 Usually it will start a patch with the multi-shit.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.080
 And then I've often found that when I turn up, oh fuck, it's even better.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.800
 Like it's even more of like a sub octave overtone.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.440
 That's how I like to patch it honestly.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.800
 Sometimes I'll turn it off and just do straight analog, which almost surprises me in a way

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.720
 because I didn't generally, I'm not going for that.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.800
 So if you were doing trying to do sub octave stuff, do you have to do it by ear or as you're

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.920
 adjusting to these, do you get any sort of feedback as a like, you're off by these semis?

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.120
 Oh yeah, you do actually.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.120
 That's a great point.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.120
 When you adjust the tones on the thing, it'll tell you how many cents you're off.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.120
 It's just fucking brilliant.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.840
 Like the hate tuning things.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.480
 Everybody does like for the most part.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.480
 That's a nice touch.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.480
 Yeah.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.160
 Kind of selling me on this thing.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.680
 I fully recommend it.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.680
 I think it's fucking amazing.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.000
 You've sold me on the desktop if they ever make one.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 I want to petition them.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.720
 I will buy a desktop in addition just to like use it live because I don't really need keys.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.680
 You know, none of us really are keyboard players.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.280
 So did it come with stickers so you can customize?

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.280
 No.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.280
 Oh yeah.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.280
 I will touch on that.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.920
 I think I was a little hyped on the model samples last time we were talking.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920
 Yes, sure.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.120
 That was a full day until I sold it basically.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.120
 Wow.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.120
 Yeah.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.120
 It just wasn't for me.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.120
 Yeah.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.120
 Analogrithm is what I mean.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.120
 Wasn't that about how long you last with the OP1?

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.120
 Yeah.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.120
 Yeah.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.120
 Those are the two shortest things ever for sure.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.120
 Didn't like you there.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.000
 That had to have been a roller coaster ride of a day though.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.400
 No, I'm going to start to finish by the end of the day and like, fuck it, this thing's

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.400
 gone.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.560
 Do you want to get into it?

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.200
 Do you want to explain like what?

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.200
 Yeah, sure.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.200
 Yeah.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.600
 So there are parts of it I like and that the knobs are there.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.600
 Right.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.600
 It works right.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.600
 And they did add the sample lock in this year.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.600
 Not just limited to like what was it for?

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.000
 Six samples which seemed a little arbitrary.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 I don't know man.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.680
 It when I'm I'm not going to prepare a bunch of samples and get them like really pristine

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.440
 and then put them on a drum machine and play them.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.680
 I need something where I'm going to design sounds on it.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.680
 I need some flexibility.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.360
 I need the ability to overdrive.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.360
 I need some analog.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.400
 I need some digital analog rhythm is just my favorite machine ever.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.800
 I'm never going to find anything that comes close really.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.640
 I don't want to say I told you so, but that's exactly what I thought.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640
 You did.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.640
 And I know it.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.880
 I was thinking I'm like, there's no fucking way he's going to like this thing more than

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.880
 the rhythm.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.880
 I was like, there's no way.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.880
 But I was I was curious.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.880
 I wanted to be surprised.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.880
 I was like, I want him to conjure some magic out of this shit and be like, fuck you, this

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.640
 thing's better than the rhythm.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.720
 You have gone completely out of your way to not say I told you so.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.720
 But you're saying I told you, me, I've already said that before.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.920
 I think right after I was like, fuck this thing, I sold it.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.080
 You're like, yeah, I expected that.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.800
 I tried it, got it out of my system to a degree.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.800
 Because I just know what I like about the rhythm and what I was seeing lacking with there.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.760
 And I know you've taken the rhythm even further.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.760
 You know what I mean?

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.760
 Like you've gone beyond with that thing than I ever have.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.160
 And I was like, I don't know how that he's going to phase it out for that.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.160
 I was hopeful.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:37.080
 I got a two bit prism in my rack.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.800
 Talk a little about that.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.800
 It's nifty.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.800
 What do you.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.800
 So what is again?

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.000
 It's like a kind of filter.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.280
 It is a filter, but so much more.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.280
 I like it.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.360
 It has some weird jazz to it.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:58.920
 I mean, basically it's a little manger, which I didn't really realize when I bought it.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:07.880
 What I wanted was a multi-mode stereo filter with interesting, CVable options that would

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.000
 pair well with clouds.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.600
 Because I'm using clouds a lot and I want to be able to filter things in stereo.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.280
 Oh, that game.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.120
 And I didn't want a giant expensive filter.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.120
 You know what I mean?

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.680
 And I looked at the price of this thing and I was like, okay, that's definitely reasonable.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.840
 How much was it?

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.320
 Two or three?

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.320
 Between two and three.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.320
 I can't remember.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.320
 I think like 250.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.320
 Around about somewhere around there.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.320
 Yeah.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.320
 And the extra stuff with it is really cool.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:42.120
 Like, I don't know exactly what you want to call it, but it's like you can't have just

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.120
 like the filter.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.120
 You know what I mean?

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.600
 It's like it's all kind of joined together.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.920
 It's like a fractal way.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.920
 You know what I mean?

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.080
 Everything intersects there, but it works.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.280
 You know, I didn't know if I would like that at first.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.840
 It was kind of annoyed that there was so much stuff tied in there, but it works well, especially

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.520
 with clouds.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.280
 It's got the buffer freeze that you can CV.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.080
 So you can kind of do like a beat repeat, like up to like two beats type of thing.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.320
 Is it all digital?

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.320
 All digital.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.320
 Okay.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320
 Yeah.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.720
 And surprisingly, the filter sounds good being a digital filter.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.600
 It has like a very vocal like character to it.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.440
 Like you can crank the resonance and you'll start to get like vowel formats.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440
 You know what I mean?

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.440
 It's interesting.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.440
 Very cool.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.440
 Yeah.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.440
 I didn't know what to expect.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.960
 So far, I've been pleasantly surprised with everything that I've done with it.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.880
 And it seems really well thought out.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.680
 Like you can have the filter.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.040
 Like I said, you can't really separate all the extra shit from the filter, but you can

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.640
 change the order of it.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:56.120
 So you can have like the filter kind of be off or you can do low pass, high pass, band

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:01.640
 pass before all the other effects or you can switch it to be after all of the effects.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.640
 Oh, cool.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.640
 That's yeah.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.640
 I felt that was like a really nice touch.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.960
 And the other effects off the top of my head, it's got like sample and bit rate reduction,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:19.680
 which you can see V. It has a weird knob which functions to the left as like a delay into

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.840
 the right as a comb filter.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:26.560
 I might be getting that backwards, but either way, it's a delay or a comb filter.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.240
 And you can kind of change how that functions as well.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:34.160
 There's a mode you can get into where the CV that would change what filter mode you're

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.800
 in, you can turn that into a clock input.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.840
 And that's directly connected to your delay now.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:46.240
 So you basically have a nice clockable digital delay in there with the other stuff.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.280
 So yeah, dig it.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.160
 So you were talking about there's this sort of like fractal network, a lot of stuff going

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160
 on.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.480
 Can you turn things down while you're trying to dial other things in?

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:01.360
 I mean, is there a way to sort of like audition certain configurations or is it basically

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.360
 like real?

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.560
 You've got this like sort of like Harry ball of stuff going on.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.720
 Yeah, I mean, there's only like four things you can really do.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.960
 So it's I keep saying like it's a good companion to clouds, but I feel like it's kind of like

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:19.200
 that in a way where you have like, you know, your basic functions there of like your modes

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.520
 of like feedback or reverb, you know what I mean, or then your main mode and things like

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.840
 that, it's like kind of in that way where like the main mode is the filter and then you

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.160
 have these other little things you bring in around it and it just creates like its own

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160
 thing.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.160
 Yeah.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.200
 And this might be a little vague to some listeners, but I've been making material that I can

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:45.600
 always say kind of harkens back to old and Zen slash gridlock because it's got that crispy

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.280
 digital sound to it.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.440
 And with the bit rate reduction that you can kind of bring in just a bit, you can make

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.200
 things sound clean yet lo-fi, you know what I mean?

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.800
 It's like like you know it's digital, you know, your ears can detect that, but it doesn't

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.920
 sound like shit.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:05.560
 It doesn't sound like like a bad VST or something, you know what I mean?

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:11.200
 It sounds like quality digital processing with enough in there to kind of mangle up your

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.280
 source and get something interesting out of it.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.480
 Very IDM friendly for lack of a better term, I guess I would say.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.640
 I imagine a lot of our listeners are ants and gridlock fans.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.640
 Yeah.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.360
 I don't think it's going to be totally foreign to them.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.360
 Yeah.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.320
 Like would I get this to run my analog base and through?

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.720
 No, you know what I mean?

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.840
 Like that I think would disappoint you.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.880
 If you're trying to create like weird glitchy IDM beats through it and you need like a stereo

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:43.040
 filter post some other like reverb effects that you're running your shit through, it's

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.040
 excellent for that.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:49.040
 With the little features like the you know the buffer, you know, beat repeat thing like

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.920
 that's typical IDM shit, you know what I mean?

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:57.760
 So I feel like it was definitely designed with that sound in mind and it kind of nails

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.400
 it for anything else, probably not so much, but that's kind of the mode I'm in right now.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.680
 Anyways, so I'm gelling with it really well, especially post clouds.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.520
 Now does it like cover some of what you would get from a camera beat repeat at all or is

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.040
 it like kind of a different beast?

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.880
 Yeah.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.840
 I wouldn't say it's that precise because you're not like clocking it, you know what I mean?

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.320
 Yeah, I got you.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.040
 But I mean it depends on how you're hitting that.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.760
 Like if you're hitting it with a sequence, yeah, it would be spot on.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.480
 Like the camera all thing, that's definitely more versatile.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.480
 You know what I mean?

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.080
 Like you can do kind of like full on rearrangements of a beat with that.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.560
 You're not going to be doing that with this.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:40.440
 But you can get little, you know, stutter steps and glitchy sounds out of it.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.600
 I like it.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:47.640
 I guess like over the last three years or so, I've owned a lot of different qubit modules.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.080
 Almost all of them I end up disappointed with for one reason or another.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.960
 So far this one I haven't found anything to really bitch about or be disappointed in.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960
 It kind of nails it.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.680
 It's in a good small package, priced right, feels solid.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.320
 The only problem I've had with it so far is I've had it freeze on startup once and I

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.400
 had to reboot my whole case to get it turned on.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.840
 Which I also had the same problem with the Nebula.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:17.080
 So I don't know, maybe they just have some issues with these digital modules and power.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.040
 So you're no stranger to having duplicates of things.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:24.120
 Is this something you would see maybe having or getting value out of having two of them?

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.360
 Yeah, I've already made space.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.680
 Like if you look at my case next to it, there's if I moved the first prism all the way to

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.760
 the right, I can fit another one right next to it and it would fill that gap perfectly.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.680
 I do plan on getting a second one.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.400
 Just the move and everything right now is kind of tap me out.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.240
 I don't have any chance to buy any new toys.

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.440
 I wasn't even going to buy that but I was like bored and I've been spending all my money

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.760
 on like responsible shit.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.760
 Yeah.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.760
 Stupid stuff.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.120
 And I was like I need something fun.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.680
 So took a little gamble on it and I'm pretty happy with it.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.320
 I give it two thumbs up.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:19.640
 The sample drum has been out for not even a month and there's been like five firmware

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.840
 revisions already.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.840
 Oh really?

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.840
 Yeah.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840
 Is this?

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.040
 No, is that because there's problems or is it because they're just going nuts making

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.040
 cool new stuff?

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.960
 It's a mixture of both.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.360
 That's why I don't own one.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:37.840
 Because like I was mentioning before I'm just fucking tired of updating shit and I know that

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.800
 anytime something digital comes out there's going to be an update shortly that follows.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:47.120
 And after going through like jump through hoops to update my Erica drums sequencer I was

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.800
 like I don't really feel like dealing with that.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:54.840
 So I was like super excited when the drum sample was released but I held off on buying.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.920
 I was like I'm going to give this a month maybe two and because I'm sure there's going

00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.920
 to be a revision.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.120
 Let it settle down a little bit.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.840
 Let everyone else been test for you.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.720
 I don't even think it was out a week and there was already a revision.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:10.000
 I was like all right and then like since then there's been a few more I think at least

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.600
 for possibly five and I was like okay I'm really glad I didn't buy this yet.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.120
 But I definitely plan on getting one.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:21.840
 Like we've discussed I think multiple times now in episodes how it would be nice if somebody

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.680
 made like a Dr. Rex into module.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.680
 Yeah.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.240
 And this is like I think as close as anything has ever come to being that.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:33.920
 You know it looks like it was right up that alley kind of hits that target.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.760
 So I have to at least try one you know what I mean.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.880
 It looks a little menu divy a little little cramped for the functionality that's in there.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.440
 You know but.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:50.200
 It's hard to tell because a lot of the videos I've seen have been with the waveform with

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.960
 action with basically not the setup to get to the craziness that they're doing.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.880
 So I'm kind of like hmm I wonder how long that actually took you to get to that.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.520
 Like that might have actually kind of been a pain to get to that point.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.520
 Right.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:10.720
 It definitely can handle slicing and like you know CV modulations within a loop.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.800
 You know what I mean to create interesting like rhythmic slicing you know break core in

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.680
 a box type of thing.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.360
 But if it takes you an hour to set that up right at a time you know what I mean like

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.800
 I don't know.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:28.840
 Dialing in slice points on that tiny screen with you know a little knob if it doesn't

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.880
 detect it automatically correctly would be a fucking nightmare.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.120
 And it's like I mean once it's sit there and do that you know what I mean.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:40.400
 Even on the ER 301 it's really fucking nice to put in slice points you're set up pretty

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.480
 well it's still kind of annoying to sit there and go through and do it sometimes.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.480
 Like it'll even hit zero points and everything.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.040
 I was gonna say there's a jump to zero like the closest zero.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.760
 You can actually select it and be like oh go to the nearest zero.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.640
 He's really smart about it but it's still sometimes it's like yeah.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.800
 It's gonna like hit a slider go up and see the thresholds hit and just like fucking play

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.480
 those you know like recycle style.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:06.720
 Every video looks super crazy and I'm all and I'm not doing stuff with that sort of like

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.120
 brain force be it some kind of like.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.440
 I know if I get it I might do that again.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.200
 I haven't really done anything like that since like early Prometheus burning stuff.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.200
 You know what I mean?

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:20.440
 Like watching demos of it I was like man that makes me want to like jump back to like

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.120
 early 2000s just two 10 BPM.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.120
 Oh yeah.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.120
 Yeah.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.400
 A little bit of break for there.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.720
 Some industrial madness just fucking lay or some gabber kicks on top of it.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.520
 It's almost inevitable when you get one.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.880
 So like you're gonna dip in you got to test the waters.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.320
 I hope the default sound bank just comes with like 200 different fucking amen breaks

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.320
 already loaded in.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:50.960
 Oh I got on my list is a analog heat really flexible the way you can frequency select

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.400
 what you're distorting.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.240
 The cool thing I like about the analog heat I'm glad I got the mark to because it kind

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:03.520
 of shows you how the modulation is affecting the signal whereas the last one didn't and

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.760
 I think it would be a little difficult to know how the envelope for you'll obviously

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.800
 hear it but it's nice to be like oh that's how much of the signal it's like biting or

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:13.120
 how much it's like carving out.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.480
 The cool thing is like every knob is saved in the preset which is awesome because if

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.520
 you recall it is absolutely the way you had it even up to like the master volume I think

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:27.560
 there's nothing that's you're gonna have to be figuring out to get it to that level again.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.520
 Stereo, stereo filter which is very nice.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.320
 I like that you can process things and filter and stereo.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.200
 I don't have like a stereo filter equipment wise normally they're mono modular ones so

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.680
 it's cool to run a piece of gear in and have it sound kind of normal.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.440
 Do you have independent controls over each filter separately?

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.440
 I mean can you?

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.320
 No it's like one filter basically and at the bottom you get like the bands that you can

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.400
 select and you get like resonance and a frequency control and you can point the LFOs to it or

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.480
 it has two CV inputs too so you can point things to that which was very appealing that

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.560
 was kind of what sold me on it.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.840
 It's like oh two CV ends?

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.760
 Fuck yeah I'll give this a try.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.200
 So I didn't realize until like right after I bought it I was like well the Sherman Filter

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.640
 Bank Compact exists and it's like the same price and I bet it sounds ridiculous.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.640
 It does.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:18.160
 I've heard but I really like the envelope follower on the heat.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.960
 The eight different distortions I was having a lot of fun with the classic distortion last

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.240
 night getting sounds from like I've been trying to get that sound for a long time and I fucking

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:31.520
 got it and it was like a fucking playground last night when I was playing it.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.720
 The screen was definitely lifting off of it when I got it.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.400
 Typical electron I was like what the fuck like it came up again and I like held it down

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.880
 for a second and then it stayed there and I think I just had to press the glue back down.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.040
 Now it doesn't lift it up yet.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.400
 We'll see like what the first hot day in July is like but you know.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.520
 Nice humid fucking club.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.760
 I also got the Mark II because it has the encoders from the Digitech and the new stuff

00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:01.080
 and I read complaints about like good luck dialing in the exact decimal value on the old

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:06.480
 one because it was like old style encoders that were not that good.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.520
 It's fucking pricey but I really like it so far.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.120
 It's got eight different distortion circuits.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:15.800
 I really like the subtle ones and I really like the some of the extreme ones too.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.800
 And you can point the CV to almost any parameter on there which is cool.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.800
 That's how I felt about the drive too.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:27.280
 I like the very subtle ones like the first clean one or whatever it is and like the last

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:34.640
 one not much in between really caught my ear but I was liking the first and the last.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.320
 The drive didn't have the filter right and it was just mono.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.560
 It had an sort of a filter.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.320
 It was like a three band EQ.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:48.200
 It had low gain you know plus minus high plus minus but then it had like it was like

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:55.880
 your notch that you could adjust to like scoop kind of in between the two and make like a

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.440
 sort of like a band pass.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.600
 You know I don't know.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.600
 That's more than this has because the one thing I don't like about this is you have

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:07.800
 two fixed frequency low and high EQs that you can just boosting like cut the gain.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.240
 And I'm like yeah it sounds good but why the fuck didn't you let us pick the frequency.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.560
 What are the frequencies are they like snare and kick is it like okay.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.560
 That's a good question.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:23.960
 It just feels almost like a mixer low high EQ if you just like a two band on a mixer.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.680
 Yeah it sounds good like quality sounds good no complaints there.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.440
 So the bottom left you get three controls which is pretty interesting.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.960
 You can get a drive control and then you get a wet drive control and then you also get

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.160
 a wet level control which is really nice so you can adjust the wet drive but you can

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.040
 also boost the wet or reduce the wet signal.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.520
 So it's got a lot of stuff that can let you kind of be like oh I just want to take the

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:51.360
 mid highs and distort those and then everything else I'm just going to leave kind of clean.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.680
 So that's one of the nicer things about is you get kind of it's almost a little multi

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.680
 bandy.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.600
 It's like they got close to multi band distortion but they didn't want to go the whole way

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.600
 or something like that.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:05.960
 So obviously it's only one distortion you don't get like four of them but it's pretty

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.760
 flexible from that standpoint.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.080
 At first I thought it was going to be really good for live stuff and I did I used it in

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.520
 Detroit with the TR8s and it was good.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.520
 I just needed to dirty that thing up because I don't really like the plain stuff like that

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:23.720
 anymore from the XOX stuff but I find that when I use it at home it takes me like a

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.360
 good ten minutes and I'll dial it in or something like that.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.000
 Oh shit that's the sweet spot.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.760
 I don't know if I want to go through that live.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760
 Everyone wait.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.760
 Hold on.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.760
 Hold on.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:35.760
 Find the sweet spot.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.760
 Oh wait that's too.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.760
 Hold.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.760
 Wait.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.960
 Can someone come up with DJ while I figure this out?

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.960
 Yeah.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:42.960
 The resonance is pretty whistly.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.120
 It's not super special but does the trick.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.320
 This is a nice change of pace from our normal.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.320
 Oh my god.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.520
 Electron what are you doing?

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.520
 Yeah.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.520
 Good.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.520
 I was skeptical.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.960
 This was like 700 bucks but it is eight distortions.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.240
 The stereo filter like the envelope follower or the CV ends.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.520
 I'm not mad at the end of the day.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.720
 I've been trying to get some of these tones for a while.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.200
 Shout out to the TV3 too.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.400
 That's kind of my favorite acid box at this point.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.920
 I think a lot of mileage out of that thing.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.920
 It's fucking.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.280
 I think it's almost better.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.960
 As I get older I turn the resonance down more and realize that it's just a fucking base

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:23.640
 monster at the end of the day and you don't need to fucking make it all tweaked out 303

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.640
 all the time.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.400
 The new manager sounds fucking good.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.120
 I haven't listened to it yet.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.320
 The one video is on Matrix.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.040
 It sounds pretty goddamn good.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.280
 It's one of those things where I'll just keep that on mind until I wander into pianos

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.600
 and stuff one day and it'll just be sitting there and it'll be like an impulse buy.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.600
 You know what I mean?

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.760
 Once I fuck with it and I'll be like oh this sounds great.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.760
 Walk out the door with it.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.520
 I think for our listeners that are not in the Pittsburgh or Bolognaux area, Thanos and

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.880
 stuff is a local music instrument shop.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:50.880
 It's pretty much.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.880
 They're great.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.880
 Yeah.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:53.880
 But like all we have.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.880
 It is.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.400
 Aside from the guitar centers which popped up and I already I think dead.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.040
 I think there's only one left.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.480
 I mean everything that I got for Prometheus burning was pretty much picked from the graveyard

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.960
 of their use section.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.640
 Every mic stand and keyboard stand.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.320
 I actually went into the used section at pianos and stuff last week.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.920
 So good there on lunch break sometimes.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.400
 I eat at curbside coffee house which is close there sometimes.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:21.400
 The only thing they had down there was pretty sad there was like a alone Volca kick like

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.400
 in the corner.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.400
 It's a weird.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.400
 It's a weird.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.400
 Pedal is sitting there.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.400
 Nobody would ever want to.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.320
 But I did play that Volca modular because you mentioned that.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.320
 Oh yeah I played that.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.320
 I got.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.080
 I'm not feeling that feeling.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.320
 I got the same result.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.320
 Really?

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.800
 I kind of like the sound of it.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.800
 Did you play with one physical?

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.000
 Yeah and I played with some.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 Oh yeah.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 I got one.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.840
 He had it on pre-order.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.840
 Brought it over.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.240
 I was kind of in three minutes.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.240
 Oh yeah.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.000
 With the sound of that little thing yeah.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.320
 But I couldn't get any.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.000
 I felt like you were the strangers.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.320
 It was like oh shit you're over there now.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.320
 Yeah.

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.240
 It was really hard to like dial in a little bit.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.000
 But yeah it's a pain in the ass program.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.160
 I wouldn't want to do it.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.880
 But like they didn't have any of the fat cables out.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.720
 For vocal blocks though like compared to all the other vocal I think it's a really interesting

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:08.720
 addition.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.680
 They had the Terraz AS1 there.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.080
 And I thought that sounded great actually when I played it.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.080
 But it was like poke.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.320
 I couldn't like get it to make notes for a second.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.920
 That little keyboard sucks ass.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.440
 The one on the Volka at least was very responsive and it was like oh this is cool.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.400
 I mean I should put that thing on the AS1 and that would be kind of cool.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.880
 You got to remember that's a demo unit.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.880
 Like I think it's manhandled every day by people slamming on that thing.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.840
 Probably trying to play it like an actual keyboard you know what I mean.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:38.680
 Children with their sticky fingers and oh still it's going to be able to take that.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.320
 Yeah that's true.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.160
 I did enjoy the sound of the AS1.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:46.320
 I've wanted one of those since it was announced and when I played with one a couple weeks ago

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.280
 up Pianos and stuff I was like yeah I still kind of want this.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.280
 It sounds good.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.280
 Yeah.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.680
 It was a little bigger than I thought.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.160
 It was a little like a little beefier.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.480
 It's substantial.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.720
 I love the format of the SB16.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.320
 I think it feels great.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.480
 It's good size.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.320
 Which speaking of Terraz is the squid.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.320
 Oh right.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.320
 It was announced.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.040
 Squid looks bigger than my SB16.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.400
 It's like yeah I think it looks big.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.480
 I was like if it was a little smaller I'd love to pair it up with it like for live.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.480
 You know what I mean.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.960
 A little sequencer it's like the same form factor slap it next to my.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.600
 How much bigger is it?

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.600
 I think it's like a few inches wider.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.040
 Like it's unnecessarily big and it doesn't even have a fucking screen.

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.200
 Yeah there's a lot of like dead space on it.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.040
 It's not like it's filled with buttons.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.880
 I mean there's a lot of buttons but it's like there's.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.600
 And there's some weird shit that doesn't need to be filled in space.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.920
 Poetry momentary swing slider which I want to hear it.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.920
 I'm very skeptical.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:47.200
 I think we all are like how much you want to introduce micro swing amounts with a significant

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.360
 part of your interface.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.360
 You know.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:54.600
 Yeah it would be nice if you can reconfigure that jog wheel to do other shit.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.600
 Yeah.

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.520
 Because otherwise I feel like that's just a waste of space.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.520
 Like and hardware.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.880
 You know that's just something else you have to worry about breaking or getting snagged.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.840
 It's like is it really worth it?

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.840
 You know what I mean?

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:10.600
 You probably could have done like an AS1 little touch thing with like a latch key.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.600
 You know what I mean?

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.880
 Like why have a hardware jog wheel?

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.520
 I hope you can configure that.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.680
 Or you guys just didn't realize that is what you've been looking for this whole.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.680
 Maybe.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.680
 And it just the missing link.

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:26.360
 It just opens up a whole new fucking world and you'll be like not only am I glad they

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.360
 put it on this.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.360
 Why doesn't everything else have this?

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.360
 That's true.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.840
 I have zero optimism that is going to be the result.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:38.840
 You do that and it just snaps dancers legs and the dance forward.

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:46.840
 You do it.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.420

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.000
