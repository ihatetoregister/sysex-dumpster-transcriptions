00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.520
 [Music]

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.360
 I like those mosaic panels.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Yeah, yeah, they're very nice.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 It's very cute little one.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 I can't read it upside down.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 What is the?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 It's a clock module.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 It sets the clock.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 You've got your output.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 But it can take clock and do division on it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 They have another tiny little tile that I just got, which is a 4 HP 1U tap tempo.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Okay.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 What's the button do?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 The button is hold.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 So you can try to, if you take the input, you can hold this.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 It won't output.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 And then do this if you want to re-sync time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Oh, so it just like mutes the clock?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 It kind of just holds it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 It just stops it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 It holds it high.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 It holds it high.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 And then when you release it, then it goes and it just picks back up where it left off.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Interesting.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 That's cool.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 I actually ordered a couple of other things from them recently from the Detroit modular.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 They've got a pretty big lineup now of 1U modules.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 They've got a VCO.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Drum mixer.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Drum mixer.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Drum mixer.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Um, I tell you, did a bunch of stuff.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.760
 Obviously ritual and after later, you know, they've been doing a lot of stuff, but I think

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.000
 mosaic is like swooping into filling those gaps.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 This is nice too.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 I mean, just having like the one you, yeah, the one you pix is a.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Is that after later?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Yes, it is.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Yeah.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 And they do a lot of different variations of peaks.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Yeah.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Yeah.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Didn't know they had a 1U.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 That's kind of cool.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Yeah.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Dead man's firm.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Dead man's catch.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Yeah.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Yeah.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.080
 It has a firmware which is really fucking nice, but I had, I did have the print out the cheat

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 sheet for it.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080
 Yeah.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.040
 There's a lot of modes and they're all.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.120
 So they're actually all pretty fucking useful.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.720
 At first I was like, yeah, I'm just, I kind of wanted the opposite when I got to this.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.960
 I was like, I just want something simple.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.400
 I just want simple LFOs or simple envelopes.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.120
 But then once I started like diving into the other stuff that that firmware has, it's

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120
 all good.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.040
 I'm pretty stoked on it.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.120
 So this is a nice, nice form factor for getting it.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.640
 These little tiny potentiometers are a little hard sometimes to dial into.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.760
 But you know, it's, it is envelopes and LFOs.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760
 It's on the world.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.760
 It's not like frequency.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.500
 You know, because they even kept these knobs for the, on the booklet, these big honking

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.120
 knobs just to get easier to dial into.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.760
 Yeah, they are nice.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.760
 Plus it just aesthetically that.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.680
 Yeah, it's hard to like fuck with it.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.200
 They did such a good job with it.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200
 Exactly.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.880
 Because I even took one of these off and put a Davey's knob on it to see like, and it looked

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.480
 fine, but it definitely like, yeah, I'm not going to fuck with this.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.920
 I have mine right next to the Danny sound, MML filter too.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.600
 And it uses the same like, Rogan, it's good knob.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.400
 So it looks, looks like nice.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.200
 That one's black though.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.000
 But, yeah, yeah.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.600
 I mean, I'm even fine with this being a, yeah, not black panel, but it's the only one

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 in there.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.600
 It's not.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.600
 It is.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.720
 It's one of the few panels that I don't, that I haven't switched to black or just painted

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.720
 myself.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.080
 I mean, it's not because I'm thinking of flipping it.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.000
 I guess we can start talking about this is the, the bukla dual oscillator.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.600
 2581 from tip top.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600
 2580.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.600
 I fucked that up.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.600
 That looks like a one to me.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 It's a lot Davey.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.360
 You know what, that's why we do this as a team.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.360
 That's right.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.200
 It falls down, the other two are there to pick us back up.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.560
 When there was only one set of footprints in the sand, it's because Nick was carrying

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560
 me.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560
 Exactly where I was going to go.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.040
 I'm glad you did.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.080
 But yes, the 2580.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.080
 Thank you, Nick.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.080
 It's fantastic.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.920
 I'm really blown away by it.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.280
 It's really, it exceeds my expectation.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.280
 And I may have mentioned this in a previous episode that like, for a really long time,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.640
 like the 90s and early 2000s, like a bukla system was like, oh my God, if I could just

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.640
 get one, that would change everything.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.520
 And it was, it was very like, like, I covered it very highly.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.840
 And then when I went to knob con and played with an easel for a while and like played

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.720
 with like a set up and all this, I was still into it.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.080
 But I kind of was like, eh, it isn't the end all be all.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.720
 And so I kind of was like, your gas got deflated.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.720
 Yeah.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.400
 On one hand, I was glad that I didn't have that fervor anymore.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.040
 But I guess it was like, yeah, it's still a sound I like.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.880
 This though, this is meeting the last remnants of what I wanted from that sound without,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.440
 you know, diving into the bukla system and the environment and frankly the cost of it.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.440
 Yeah, I agree.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.160
 It's a two oscillators.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.360
 They both start from sign, but the top one goes sign to saw.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.920
 And then the bottom one is sign to square.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.480
 And then outside of that, they are basically the same controls, same inputs.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:20.000
 Two outputs track one volt per octave, CV over the shape, which is rad.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.600
 There's an input for FM.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.160
 And then there's this processor.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.120
 I think that's bipolar FM.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.120
 Where's the other ones?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.120
 So this is not?

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120
 Yeah.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.800
 Now a couple of weird things is that I kind of expected when I first saw it was I kind

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.920
 of assumed there would be some sort of normal on the FM between the two, but they're not.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.800
 You've got to you've got to patch them.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.800
 Not a huge complaint.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.920
 It's just don't expect normal to fit nothing is plugged in.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.480
 And that may actually be the end of my list of complaints slash oddities.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.480
 It's fucking amazing.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480
 I think they nailed it.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.640
 Yeah, I'll say that it's like an interesting not that I care with the panels like thinner

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.800
 than other panels.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.440
 It's always like a little sunk behind other stuff, which I don't care about.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.080
 Yeah, for like 200 bucks to get two of those oscillators.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.800
 And I'm like you like, I'm going to use the easel.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.480
 I forget where I think I used Richard Nichols easel at oscillate years ago.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.000
 And I was like, wow, that's completely underwhelming.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.120
 Um, didn't really like it.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.360
 Didn't like the 200 E stuff when I used it.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.240
 It just like, it just wasn't super appealing.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.520
 And this is always like kind of what I've wanted from Google.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.440
 I don't even want the other modules so much.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.760
 Like this five step sequencer looks cool, but it's not like that's kind of redundant.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.000
 It just looks like it's nicely laid out.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.960
 Um, but yeah, it's like kind of the one I want.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.480
 I'm super happy with it.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.800
 The sound quality is fantastic.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.680
 Oh, absolutely.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.800
 And it holds the low end.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.880
 It was so excellent.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.840
 Really well in a way that was, um, you know, I don't even know if that's historically

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.680
 accurate or not, like I like and I don't care.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.200
 I was shocked by just how well like everything has a like a beef to it that is shocking.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200
 Yeah.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.880
 Because I remember at knob con one year later, um, one of the last ones I used a 200 that

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.800
 like two, five, eight are the Roman flip off dude that does Sputnik stuff.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.040
 Mates his, it makes his clones that go for like five grand.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.720
 And I patched that up because I always wanted to hear it and it sounded ridiculous.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.640
 And then I got like the same feel from it when I patched that up.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.640
 I'm like, oh, sweet.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.640
 This totally covers what I want for like 20 for the price.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.320
 You know, it's ridiculous.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:29.320
 Um, you know, if, if anyone goes on the internet, you're going to see plenty of videos of people

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.840
 doing some, just, you know, just letting it run as a drone or as a, some pad, this sort

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.720
 of like, you know, not, not all of a typical use, but like really just an unprocessed

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.320
 bookless sound.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.760
 That sounds good on its own.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.760
 Yeah.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.360
 But I've been fucking with this and doing different things with it.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.560
 It's actually more versatile than I thought it was going to be getting drum sounds out

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.560
 of it.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.680
 And like you were saying, doing, having the CV over the shape and what that does the sound

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.680
 sounds awesome.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.680
 Sounds amazing.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.680
 Yeah.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.920
 Like boring stuff with it.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.920
 That sounds good.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.560
 Like the triangle wave sounds really nice.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:09.040
 Like it just has, I don't know, um, something to it, something on the waveform that looks

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.960
 a little special and sounds really good.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960
 And the deal is up bargain.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.800
 Like they could have charged much more money and they would have sold out just as quickly.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.040
 So it's cool that they actually like, here's a fucking budget option, something we didn't

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.400
 like turn into a joke, you know, it's pretty like they nailed the sweet spot.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.200
 Much respect for tip top for that shit and book.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200
 Same here.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.160
 Also, similarly, I don't know if I'm going to get any of the other ones.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.280
 You know, I've looked at them and even the, the, the chaos or the random.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.640
 Is that source of uncertainty?

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.640
 Yes.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.640
 Yeah.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.880
 I might get it, but I, I don't necessarily know if I'm super excited about having a full

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.440
 book, a workflow.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.840
 I think I'm just happy with this.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.840
 Yeah.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840
 I'm right there too.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.840
 I don't want to get the rest of them.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.240
 A lot of people like want to build full cases of them.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.640
 When I get that, like I can see the appeal of it, but there's too much overlap with stuff

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.480
 I already have, you know, I don't need to low pass gates.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.080
 I don't need more slope generators or anything like that, but yeah, I could see it being appealing

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.880
 if you didn't already have a system.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.880
 Yeah.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.960
 You know, if you're starting from scratch and you're like, well, fuck it.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.680
 I'm going to go this like pseudo buccula route here, especially for the price.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.240
 I mean, it's one of the cheapest options.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.640
 Just period to getting like your ownership that is decently made.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.640
 Yeah.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.880
 There's a part of me that was like, I've got to find something bad with this, but there

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.760
 was a couple of things in like the Mod Whickler thread.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:33.560
 I think someone made like a comment about like it seeming the pots feeling flimsy.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.240
 I don't know what they're talking about.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240
 There's nothing.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.240
 I mean, like you're right.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.560
 The panel's a little thinner, but it's not bending.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.880
 I'm not having any sort of like- I'm going to jiggle your pots to do it.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.440
 Go ahead and jiggle.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.800
 For the viewers at home, there is jiggling.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800
 Yeah.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.640
 It's not really feel given that.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.640
 Yeah.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.840
 It doesn't feel like a plasticy pot.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.280
 I don't know what's under that knob, but it feels solid.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.280
 Yeah.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.720
 I mean, a new industrial music electronics module is going to be way more wobbly than that.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.720
 Right.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.640
 Not that I care about that either.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.080
 But yeah, the knobs feel like a little cheaper clone of like the Rogan ones.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.000
 I don't think they're the nicer knobs, but it doesn't like, it looks great.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.120
 You know, I'm not changing anything about mine either.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.280
 It's fucking, I like the fake banana jacks and the way they color coded it.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.080
 That one actually kind of lends itself well to the format.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.360
 I feel like the wiggly pots is just like a meme at this point.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.360
 Yeah.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.400
 Doesn't matter what gets released by whom there's always going to be at least one person and

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.600
 be like, "Well, the pots feel a little flimsy, a little wobble there, a little disappointed

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.600
 guys."

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.600
 Yeah.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.760
 I don't know what metric they're using to determine what's flimsy and wasn't, but I

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.880
 feel like there are those knobs that like, they feel like they're about to break in your

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.880
 hand.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.000
 Those are bad, but they're honestly kind of rare.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.440
 Yeah, and say the only time I've experienced knobs that bad or pots that bad, I should

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:03.080
 say, was like independent clones that somebody made and they just obviously use like the

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.760
 cheapest parts possible.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.760
 Right.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.760
 Yeah.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.240
 I felt like shit, but yeah, I don't know.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.800
 Not everything is going to feel like a synthesis technology pot.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.800
 Yeah.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.040
 Like those, you know, those are always incredibly solid, but any anywhere in between I think

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.040
 is acceptable.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.960
 Yeah.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.800
 I'm not going to give any oxygen to the idea that this is somehow not startley made.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.400
 It's really fucking up your sound when you feel that wobble.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.760
 Also, holy shit, half that thread is about people bitching that it's not in bubble wrap

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.000
 and it's like, maybe they just made like a decision to be like, "We'll see how many

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.680
 we get back and like, bet you yours fucking works fine."

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.680
 Right?

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.680
 I bet you it does.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.160
 It's amazing how we go in the box.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.000
 Yeah, it was just like in the box basically.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 It tightly fit in the box.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 It's snug in the box.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.920
 Okay.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.800
 Well, like Erica sense stuff.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.520
 Dope for just gives it to you in a fucking plastic bag all the time.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.520
 Yeah.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.520
 A Ziploc.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.520
 Yeah.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.520
 That's how I got all the first Dope for stuff for me.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.720
 It's like I'm not bouncing around in the box.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720
 It's fine.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720
 Yeah.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.640
 No, it's going to be in pink bubble wrap.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.120
 Also there's probably nothing in there that's that static sensitive.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.120
 Like think about it.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.440
 There's no fucking ICs in there, I bet.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.440
 You know, maybe there.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.440
 Maybe there.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.440
 I could be wrong.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.560
 But like, you know, for controversy and for, you know, an exciting coverage on this, I

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.360
 would love to have found something to complain about.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.360
 Yeah.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:29.320
 And yet even with that desire, with that desire to complain, which is, you know, pretty strong

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.560
 in me.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.960
 I love a good complaint.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.960
 I couldn't find anything.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.080
 This is, I think they nailed it.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.800
 So any other dual loss that you're going to spend $200 on is probably going to be dog

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.800
 shit.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.800
 Yeah.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.800
 Or not as versatile.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800
 Yeah.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.160
 I think that's the other thing is like you can probably find some really bland bread and

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.160
 butter.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.440
 And a log oscillators that you're going to get.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.600
 You're going to get from A to Z pretty quickly.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.440
 This is something that sounds better than my plate, Steve.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.440
 Lots.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.920
 It's very different.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.920
 200 bucks.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920
 Different.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.920
 Yeah.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.720
 I mean, I think that's a little bit like it's apples and oranges, honestly.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.920
 I mean, I have, I would not get rid of one over the other.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.920
 Nah.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.920
 Yeah.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920
 I like a booth a lot.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.920
 Same here.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.320
 My plots is not in this palette that we're looking at right now, just because it's in my

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.320
 other machine.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.800
 The FM though, you definitely couldn't get plots to it.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.440
 Because you're an analog here.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.440
 It's right.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.440
 It's true.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.240
 As it is beside this ornament and crime and FXA, it's, yes, I'm definitely an analog

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.240
 purist.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.000
 The ornament and crime actually, the display's been ripped out in a piece of wood has been

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.160
 put in its place.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.000
 It's just an abacus.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.680
 Hardison wood panels.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.920
 I mean, as far as my notes go, that is the top one and it's underlined.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.960
 So to our listeners at home, there's show and tell going on right now.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.040
 I brought this palette in with the Bucala, sitting here with a bunch of other stuff.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:00.040
 Nick also participated in show and tell me, Greg is not, by the way.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.120
 I don't know if we really need to make sure that everyone understands that Greg is not

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.840
 participating in show and tell.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.680
 Even though we're in a room at his house with a million amazing things, I brought a

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.880
 rock for a rock.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.280
 He's sparkling water.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.320
 But Nick has brought something for, oh, good.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.960
 No, that just triggered a flashback for me.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.960
 Show and tell.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.320
 Yeah, I'll never forget.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.400
 First grade doing show and tell.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.520
 Everyone has toys, you know what I mean, things like that.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.480
 I brought some Star Wars toys.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.160
 I don't remember which one specifically, but I was all excited to show off my Star Wars

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.160
 toys.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:44.360
 And there was this one kid who was always weird and we knew he was like kind of poor, but

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.960
 we were all buddies with him anyways.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:53.680
 And for show and tell, he brought in a secrets, um, Losin's tin.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.680
 Oh, okay.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.680
 Okay.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.520
 And then he opened it up and he showed us his gum band.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.520
 Single?

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.520
 And some paper clips.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.920
 Yeah, it was a gum band.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:09.800
 There was an eraser in it, some paper clips, and I think a coin.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.560
 And that was his show and tell.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.680
 And that just always made me feel like such a piece of shit.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.440
 Like, you know, there was plenty of kids laughing at him and shit like that.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.760
 But like even in first grade, like I had like the empathy, you know, awareness.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.080
 I was just like, fuck.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:31.640
 This kid doesn't have a lot to talk about, man.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.040
 It was just really sad.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.160
 And anytime I think of show and tell that just pops back in my brain.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.160
 So yes, I brought a secretes tin and I'm showing you my gum band.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:46.960
 Also, by the way, this does need an editor's note for everyone outside of Pittsburgh who

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.640
 doesn't know what the fuck you're talking about when you say gum band.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.560
 Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.720
 A rubber band.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.720
 A rubber band.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.720
 Yes.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.960
 A little Pittsburgh.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.720
 Pittsburghies happening for everyone outside of Pittsburgh.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720
 Yeah.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.520
 That was a dramatic story there.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.120
 Yeah, I was trying to keep it, you know, on the low dark mood.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.640
 The easy sound tone.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.440
 Who I know a shot.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:24.440
 But yeah, in front of me is not a gum band, but an oxy one sequencer, which I've mentioned

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:30.040
 on here before and waited like, I think it was half a year before they ended up producing

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.720
 it, but they were actually oxy instruments who makes the oxy one.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.720
 They were super transparent and they hit all their dates and as far as kick starters

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.640
 go, it was a pretty fucking good one in that regard.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.040
 You got this through the kick starter?

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.040
 Yep.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.240
 Yeah, I was one of the, I was the tail end of it, which is why I was the part of the very

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.600
 last shipment to the last 50.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.680
 How fuck are you powering it?

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.680
 Good question.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.360
 It's got an internal battery that you can charge.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.200
 It's also got Bluetooth.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.040
 Is that replaceable?

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040
 Good question.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.240
 I think so, at least they don't have any instructions on how to and actually thinking

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.240
 about it because I have it powered right now with no cables.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.640
 Yeah, that's what blew my mind.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.160
 I was wondering why you didn't plug it in at first, but now I see you don't have to.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.760
 Yeah, and it's got a nice feature.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.040
 You can see it's got a shit ton of fucking IO.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.360
 And one of the things that's confusing at first is like a four sequencer sequencer.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.840
 You can't say it's four track, but it's four sequencer and you can pick types.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:32.120
 You can pick like still learning this, you can pick like mono sequencer type, you can

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.120
 pick poly.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.520
 There's like a chord one that does like chords in it will show you like you can hit a button

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.200
 to change the inversions and shit, which is really cool.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.080
 If you're somebody that doesn't know, chord stuff that well.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.760
 Multi track is actually the answer for like, why does it have eight CV gate pairs if you

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:54.720
 only have four like track sequencers is multi, you can kind of collapse stuff down to a single

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.720
 lane.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:01.280
 And take like, I think one of the other types and like collapse them down into a multi and

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.800
 it'll kind of smush them together and then you can address more of the output tracks.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.040
 So when you smush them, how does that work when you're doing things with chords?

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.040
 Good question.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.720
 I haven't like played with that too much yet.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.760
 As far as I know, it will put that all under like a single lane on here.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.000
 I don't know how editing works at that point.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.240
 That's one of the track types I haven't fucked with too much.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.760
 I've been playing with mono, poly and chord and actually this firmware on here is actually

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.360
 you can't even get it.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:34.520
 Mine came with 1.8, but you can only download 1.6 right now and it's got this stochastic

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.000
 mode, which you can do some.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 I haven't.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.240
 This is the first time I've even gone into it.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.240
 So I have no idea.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.480
 I was going to ask if you're doing like, seating or what you're doing for like, you can stochastic

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.480
 parameters.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.200
 They ripped off some mono stuff as far as I know.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.760
 And it'll do a bunch of like random skipping around of a sequence.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.760
 Like I don't understand that one very well yet.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.760
 But it's cool.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.040
 You get this view and you can see you've got like four different lanes there.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.360
 And the cool thing is you can kind of like trigger these in time and be like, start on

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.160
 the next bar or wait until then I trigger you and then start on two bars so you can get

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.000
 stuff to all like sequence in time.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 Shit.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.400
 Mute it, unmute it.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.560
 There's like a keyboard mode.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.480
 So this is just like everything that you're playing and you can record stuff in here.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.360
 The only bug I've run across so far is like I've gotten some hanging notes like awns that

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.160
 are stuck in the keyboard mode.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.360
 I'm sure they'll fix that.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.960
 That's nothing big.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.360
 There's an arpeggiator mode I haven't fucked with too much here.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.720
 Oh, I'm on the wrong track type.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.800
 You got to be on the poly.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.320
 Kind of modes we got an ARP.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.320
 Question.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.320
 Oh, there's.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.920
 On nothing too sexy.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.160
 Oh, okay.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.920
 Off, up, down, up, down, too up, too down.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.240
 Alternate in, alternate out, alternate in out.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.240
 Pinky thumb.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.080
 I don't even know what the fuck that is.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080
 Random.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.880
 I'm definitely still learning.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.880
 I've only had it.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.800
 I think I got this last Monday or something like that.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.640
 Can you do things like change the ARP type per step or anything like that?

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.080
 I don't think so.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.280
 I think it's fixed.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.280
 You can do something like, I think, you can do it.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:21.160
 It's got a CV input and you can like CV in the track length and shit like that.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.520
 There's a bunch of different destinations that you can CV.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.720
 I think if you go to mod, yes, CV in and the destination could be velocity, pitch, octave,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.360
 gate, mod, pitch, bend, division, a parameter, you could set trigger probability.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.560
 Any of the CCs.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.040
 So it's does MIDI.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.800
 H, CV gates.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.760
 The entire back of this thing is riddled with inputs and outputs.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.640
 You can send tempo synced LFOs out of those.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.480
 You can send pitch and gate out of those.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.480
 You can change.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:55.160
 You can assign any of them to any track basically and just be like, oh, even in a chord mode,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.480
 you can say every third note of a chord send that to one of the CV outputs.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.440
 So is that all output generally on the back?

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.920
 Yeah, most of its output.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.880
 These are eight CV gate outs.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.720
 There's the clock out to the clock or CV in.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.720
 There's actually, that's TRS.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.200
 So you can get a splitter and send it to either MIDI and MIDI out.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.400
 So not too much CV in compared to like the Westlake performer, which I have or some other

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.640
 things.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.400
 And then this awesome pipe output, which is mini HDMI to the module that I got, which

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.080
 is the oxy pipe, which turns out like I'm so fucking glad I got that because it couldn't

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.800
 be more convenient.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.800
 It works really well.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.360
 It's a passive module, but I don't know.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.680
 Is any pitch artifacts or anything like that?

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.280
 And it's basically just giving you an interface to that output.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.280
 Yeah.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.800
 Each track can have its own clock division, which is nice.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.800
 Think you can do quantized and unquantized recording.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.800
 Yeah.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.840
 Definitely still learning it.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.240
 It's really easy to be a duplicate stuff or to like extend pattern lengths out.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.200
 What, like, how does it save as far as like presets or like, like, how do you build, like,

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.560
 is there scenes?

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.560
 Good question.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.640
 So in here, and this is what I'm still learning, there's different.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:13.320
 I haven't set up many patterns yet outside of just single ones, but here's like the sequence

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.120
 or a ranger and you can kind of like play the different patterns on the tracks and shit

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.120
 like that.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120
 Gotcha.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.120
 This part, I don't understand much either.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.760
 I've just been figuring out how to sequence with it.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.760
 Really digging it.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.760
 It reminds me so much of the deluge and this button grid is actually the exact same number

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.920
 and dimensions of the deluge button grid.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.560
 It's probably the same part.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.560
 Mm hmm.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.720
 I'll do mine if I push one of these.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.720
 No, go ahead.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.200
 Oh, that's 100% the same.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.200
 When I got it, I was like, oh, cool.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.680
 And that's the one thing I really missed about the deluge.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.720
 In fact, for a minute, I was looking at deluge and scanning.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.000
 They're still like very expensive.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.840
 They're one of those things that I think are even more than the new cost right now.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.840
 Yeah.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.840
 Yeah.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.000
 But I love being able to sequence, note sequences and be able to see it visually.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.480
 It's, I was thinking about this today in the shower of all places as I normally do like,

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.760
 I like my modular because I'd like to be able to see visually what's going on in one

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.400
 place and also really like this sequencer because it lets me do the same.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.840
 It's not like this note number tucked into a lane.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.840
 Yeah.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.840
 Let's go.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.840
 I can just see this fucking note.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.600
 It makes a lot of sense to me.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.600
 I think this is a chromatic.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.800
 I don't even understand this.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.880
 Maybe this is one of the CC outlets.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.680
 Definitely still learning it as I'm trying to learn the MZ7, the O7, which I'll talk about

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.680
 too.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.920
 So there are parts of it that have confused me a little kind of describing this to the

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.920
 listeners here.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.440
 Obviously, this is more than a monom too, but all of the buttons obviously have like multiple

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.000
 colors they can be.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 Yeah.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.240
 And it almost looks like a, like a jacked up beat, beat step pro.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.240
 Right.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.280
 But with like, you're changing the color in real time.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.080
 So yeah, this is, this looks amazing.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.160
 Yeah, I'm super happy with it, especially for the price.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:01.280
 I think it was like 750 including the module, which is really fair.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.120
 It came out, there was a minute when it was shipping to me and the Hapax was released

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.280
 where I was like, uh, you know, I'd used to use the pyramid forever.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.440
 I was almost going to like buy the Hapax and then flip this the moment it arrived.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.160
 And then Luke actually got the Hapax, which he really likes.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.640
 And I'm like, I'm just going to get this and chill with this.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.640
 And I'm glad I did.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.320
 It's a, I like the battery, the portability.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.560
 I haven't fucked with the Bluetooth much, but it's cool.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.920
 Like they let you update the Bluetooth firmware separately from the other ones.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.560
 Like it seems to be designed very well.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.280
 I think it's like a one or two person show and they got the hardware done and they're

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.280
 like, cool.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.280
 Now I'm onto the firmware.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.360
 And I will say for a lot of projects, like looking at you, eloquencer and some other

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.320
 things, like they've been releasing updates like rapidly to fix bugs.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.680
 So you get the sense this is their one and only thing and they're focused on it.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.360
 Yeah, it looks like they're going to nail this.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.480
 Seems like they're excited to work on the firmware and more.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.440
 I'll say to a clocks and receives clock like a motherfucker have used it stably for hours.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.040
 I would use it and we'll use it in my next live set.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.040
 Oh, question.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.520
 That was going to be one of my questions.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.720
 It's been totally solid.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.320
 It also looks, it also looks heartily built.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.080
 Like, like this is well constructed.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.840
 It's all like steel.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.080
 They talked a lot of on the Kickstarter about the process of this.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.000
 They changed the design multiple times to make it better as they just used the instruments

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.880
 that like they fucking crushed it in that regard.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.840
 So those of us that didn't participate in the Kickstarter, is this available or is it

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.200
 like a waiting list or like how do you actually get one of these if you, you know, don't

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.200
 already have one.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.520
 I think you can just order right now, if I recall, but it's still like they build them

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.160
 as they can get MCU's the arm processors for them, which are hard to get.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.440
 So it's always like you could tell when they get another like tray of 50.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.000
 They're like, yes, you know, 50 more.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.920
 It's like, yeah, it's just hard to get those for everybody.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.600
 That's why the Hapax, the next batch is until June just because of the fucking processors

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.160
 and ship building it all.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.800
 But kind of generative functions can it do.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:04.720
 So the stochastic stuff, which is in beta, outside of that, there's not too much generative.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.200
 There's like the random step kind of functionality.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.000
 There's the ability to CV like the, some of those values like step length and things

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 like that.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.800
 And I think even maybe sequence length.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.160
 But outside of that, not much other than that stochastic thing, which I haven't fucked

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.160
 with too much.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.320
 So we can you have different lengths per track and you have them?

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.400
 Oh, that's cool.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.880
 You can have different lengths per track.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:32.160
 Actually, it's nice that this overview lets you kind of reset these tracks too, because

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.000
 it gets fucking haywire pretty quickly when you have different track lengths.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.800
 And it does it true, you know, like how the deluge has the two modes, like the true, what

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.400
 the fuck is it?

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.480
 What's the word for that when you have like two different sequence types and the one is

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.560
 like following a master reset and the other one's just always run on there.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.560
 Oh, fuck.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.760
 Well, I didn't.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.760
 The pyramid let's use.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.760
 Paul, is that true?

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.760
 Yeah.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.760
 Yeah, yeah, Pauli metric.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.760
 Thank you.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.360
 I was thinking we could turn it into like the contest for our listeners to fill in that

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.840
 blank and then they win something if they actually can remember that word.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.280
 I think you can change.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.280
 Maybe I'm wrong.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.640
 Oh, maybe LFO is just for the track, but it's got a MIDI and CV LFOs.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.720
 I was definitely, this is actually I've gotten the virus TI back out again because I was

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.040
 like, okay, let's sit down with this.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:28.200
 And it's fucking amazing to just sit this down with one MIDI cable into the tie sequence.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.960
 All the parts on it that you want basically send LFOs over CCs and things like that.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.240
 It's just, it's a lot of fun in that way.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.040
 It's really, really fun to use.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.400
 I'm really digging it.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.480
 Yeah, which kind of brings me to you got my Jupiter six back and the first thing I did.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.000
 So thank you, Chase Smith of a specs, electronics, specs and sales, electronics.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.800
 Imana, Willie Burnett out of New York out of New York out of Brooklyn.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.840
 They fixed a lot of stuff, tried to get my Jupiter fixed.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.000
 It was like out of my understanding of being able to fix it turned out it was something

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.960
 with the film capacitors on the voice boards, which I have on order now from Mauser.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.960
 Chase couldn't get them in time.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.080
 He said, no, I reseeded the ICs.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.040
 He redid most of the active electronics, charged me like almost nothing for it.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.000
 I paid him like more than he charged me for.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.280
 It works and it sounds fucking incredible.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:27.120
 I just sat down with it in the oxy and it was a lot of fun to output chords into it.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.120
 Oh yeah.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.640
 That's the thing.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.720
 I was really ramped up to sell it for a while.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.080
 I was even going to sell it broken because I'm just like, I don't want to take care of

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.480
 a 43 year old synthesizer for much longer.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.120
 I don't think that thing has been functional since I've known you.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.120
 Yeah, it's always had prob.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:49.560
 I was just kind of like off in your setup, like just chilling.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.840
 It's been broken more often than not.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.360
 But when it does work, it's awesome, except some of the things inherent to the Jupiter

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.720
 6 clicky envelopes that are kind of fucking annoying, but you can just bump the attack

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.920
 up a little and get out of that trap a little.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.800
 But yeah, super enjoying that.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.360
 The combo, I'm glad I have it.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.360
 I'm going to keep it.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.040
 I'm not going to sell it at this point.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.440
 Or at least I'm going to play with it for a long time.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.720
 Because Chase calibrated it.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.360
 It's like, oh, this is what it's like when this thing actually all works perfectly.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.360
 Nice.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.640
 Yeah, no, I remember you were fired up to sell it.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.520
 But that's rather you're keeping it.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.520
 Yeah.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.160
 Yeah, I got it for a song in 2003 or something like that.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.200
 I bet it looks sexy next year.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.200
 808.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.200
 Oh yeah.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.840
 No, it's even the 808 are fine friends.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.840
 Yeah.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.160
 You had a question you were going to ask me about it, didn't you?

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.360
 My question was going to be, are you keeping it?

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.360
 Oh yeah.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.480
 Because I remember you were talking about getting rid of it.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.960
 And I think there was one time I was at your house when we were working on something.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.400
 And it was on.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:03.440
 But even then, it was basically already having fits and wasn't working.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.560
 So I'm very excited to see what you cook up with an actually working one.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.560
 Yeah.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.800
 I'm going to recap some of the voice boards.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.880
 It's got a little bit of dirt in the VCR, a little bit of a click.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.320
 But it's not like a big deal.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.920
 But I wonder if replacing those film caps will kind of make it a little more smooth.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.560
 But yeah, I'm just like to keep it now that I know that somebody can like help me with

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.560
 it.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.600
 Because the other person I went to was like, yeah, it'll just be a year and it's going

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.360
 to be $2,000 no matter what's wrong with it.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.240
 Because I, you know, fix fucking things for the Eagles and you're just some dumbass in

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.760
 Pittsburgh, you know, and I get it.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.760
 Like, and even at one point was like, yeah, okay, let me know in half a year and they

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.760
 never got back to me.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.760
 And I called them and they're like, yeah, it'll be a year from now.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.560
 I'm like, okay, I can't keep doing this.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.000
 And that was part of the frustration is like, because I don't want to maintain vintage

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 gear.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.160
 I'm not into it.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.160
 I don't want to.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:02.040
 I can see how some people are like building modules, but not, yeah.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:07.720
 It's like to have both of these huge positive editions.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.800
 I'm really glad that I jumped on this like half a year ago.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.160
 Totally slipped onto my radar, man.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.840
 A few months back before I was getting too deep into VCB rack, I was looking at outboard

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:26.640
 sequencers again and I kept leaning towards the torso mainly because I liked some of the

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.640
 generative functions that I had, you know what I mean?

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:36.160
 But I did not like how everything was like kind of tucked away on that thing.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:43.120
 Like it's too small, too menu based, but seeing this grid, like that's always been

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.720
 in a highlight for any sequencer that I've enjoyed over time.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.720
 No doubt.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.720
 Being able to see the steps.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.800
 And it doesn't look like it's one of the problems I had when I had a monom was it's

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.800
 basically a sea of buttons.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.800
 There's a sea of buttons.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.720
 Yeah, it's always been too daunting to me.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.240
 That's why I didn't like to lose either though.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.120
 Like that's kind of turned off like because it looked like a monom to me and I'm just going

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.320
 to get lost in a sea of nondescript white buttons.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.320
 I don't know.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:13.000
 I'm totally reasonable and I, but I've never had that problem with deluge where even having

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.840
 the smallest monom that you can, that I can make, I got lost even in that tiny grid where

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:23.000
 like this, this doesn't, I mean, this doesn't have that problem and deluge doesn't for me.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 Yeah.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.960
 This is a, this is pretty nice.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.440
 Yeah, I'd like to know more about the stochastic feature.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.440
 Yeah.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.560
 I wonder if I could get it to work a little better here.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:43.600
 Like if it can do certain things like transpose once per cycle or, you know, anything like

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.560
 that that make it like evolve.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:51.040
 Oh, one, that's a actually good question is one thing it does have is a trigger conditions

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.040
 from the electron.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.040
 Cool.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.040
 Nice.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.200
 So you can do like play this.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.840
 Why don't I can't remember how to play it once every fourth rotation.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.840
 Yeah.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.840
 I think it's on the gate.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840
 Yeah.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.840
 What the fuck is that?

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.440
 I forget because yeah, I was super excited about it.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.440
 Yeah, trigger 100%.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.880
 You can do percentage and then it goes right to one every two times, one every three times

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.560
 like everyone up to eight times.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.560
 Nice.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.560
 Yeah.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.560
 That's awesome.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.560
 Yeah.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.560
 That's fucking huge.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.800
 I got so excited by that feature because that's really key to me because that's one thing.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.640
 The 707, which I may talk about, can't do that.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.640
 Right.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.760
 And I'm realizing that electrons are ruined to me.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.520
 And if the sequencer doesn't have that, I really have a hard time getting into it.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.600
 So one of the one of the things that Duluth has is if you've got two, two notes on different

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.840
 tracks on the same step, you can have them based on, you can do percentages based on

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.840
 either of them.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:51.720
 And if they add up to a hundred, that means at least one of them will be done every time.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.720
 That's smart.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.720
 This doesn't have that.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.480
 No, I might suggest that.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.360
 Here's the thing that this other product does.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.400
 It's incredibly fucking nice.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.240
 I use this shit out of it.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.120
 So that would be really rad if they added that to this too.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.160
 I don't think that was there when I was using it.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.400
 Oh, random perform.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.400
 What is it?

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.840
 You can do some random velocity, random, octave, random retrigger.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.440
 And you can perform those to some degree.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.560
 I don't know how that works yet either.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.560
 Okay.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.560
 And you clit in.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.560
 So I take it, you can use this as a drum sequencer.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.560
 Yeah.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.560
 It has like ratcheting.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.360
 It has retriggers, no ratcheting.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.920
 It does have, no, it doesn't have microsteps.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.920
 The 707 does.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.920
 Okay.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.920
 Oh, wait, wait, wait.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.920
 No, it might be wrong.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.040
 Damn it.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.880
 I think it does have the ability to shift in time.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.880
 Cool.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.080
 Why am I missing that?

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.280
 I could be again thinking about the 707.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.520
 So while you're looking for that, I want to let the users know that whatever this little

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.440
 screen on it is looks fucking amazing.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.840
 I'm like, on the other side of a table and I can read this perfectly fine.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.840
 Yeah.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.840
 Like any angle.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.840
 Yeah.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.840
 This is OLED.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.840
 This is really nice.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.320
 The 707, it actually inverts the more you look at it at a different angle.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.680
 That's like, oh, yeah, you can offset each step individually, retrigger it, trigger probability

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.480
 and glide.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.240
 You can set for every step.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240
 Oh, nice.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.240
 Yeah.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.800
 Yeah, yeah, I'm super psyched on it.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800
 Still learning.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.040
 There's still, it's still in development.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.080
 Like for right now, you can't save as on a project.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.640
 Like if you're doing work on project one and you like where you're going, you better

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.320
 keep saving project one.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.360
 Because when you can't like save project one to project two yet and people are like

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.360
 immediately complaining.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.640
 He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get to it.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.640
 I know I know.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.640
 I know.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.640
 Right.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.640
 For now, just like work with this, right?

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.640
 Or you can.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.600
 Back up software or something like that where you can like back the thing up and then like

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600
 copy something over manually.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.600
 So that's a little clunky.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.600
 Yeah.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.600
 But he's known.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.240
 He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not as important right now.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.440
 I'm like, cool, I get it.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.680
 And it sounds like you have work with that.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.680
 That will actually be executed well.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.240
 Given the how quick the updates have been coming out after the hardware release, I've

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.680
 got some faith in the fact that it's not like it works.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.840
 I haven't had it crash on me.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:15.360
 And from that stuck note, nothing weird has happened.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.000
 And apparently the battery will last for like up to six hours or something like that.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.640
 On a charge.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.840
 You charge it on the left side.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.360
 There is a USB, which is your USB MIDI and you're charging.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.360
 Gotcha.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.600
 And then there's the little off button.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.880
 That's about it.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.280
 This is also smaller than I thought it was going to be facing the pictures.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.720
 I thought it was going to be along the size of the Medusa.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.640
 Like that's the form factor I thought it was going to be.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.360
 And this is maybe the same size as the Beatstep Pro.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.720
 Maybe a little bit wider.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:52.400
 But this is going to add nothing to it like a live set.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.400
 How much you got to carry around the way now?

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.400
 Exactly.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.160
 That's why it already made its way into the live set of two all live sets easily.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.280
 Just because it's so easy.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.320
 The MIDI, it's all eight inch jacks.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:09.440
 But I think they actually have it where it will work with both of the stupid types of

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:14.400
 MIDI to eighth inch, which I think anybody anymore should do.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.400
 Yeah.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.400
 Super sick.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.280
 Oh, and you can like nudge sequences back and forth in time.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.040
 It has most of the stuff that you could think of.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.960
 Copy and paste works really well for notes and patterns.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.960
 Yeah.

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.440
 And you can configure stuff like you can have it follow.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.440
 The sequence are not.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.440
 Oh.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:38.000
 You can all this program stuff that isn't active and kind of go back, which not too many pieces

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.360
 of gear will do.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.360
 Yeah.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.840
 Oxy instruments, Oxyone.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:47.640
 Hope they keep cranking them out and can get their parts and everything because they

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.160
 stoked on it.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.160
 Yeah.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.480
 I can see getting one of these in the future at some point.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.640
 Like you're getting a lot of shit for that amount of money.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.640
 Yep.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.640
 Yeah.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.360
 This in the half acts I think are like kind of a next step up for hardware sequencers.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:08.800
 Especially the half acts is 999 and that thing can do like way more than this honestly.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.960
 I like this approach too.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.760
 It's a little simpler, but still has a lot of power.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.080
 The half acts can load like two projects at once.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.360
 Like all sorts of weird shit.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.360
 Yeah.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.720
 It's cool to see what people are doing.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.720
 Just imagine like having this like 20 years ago.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.880
 Fuck is this?

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.880
 Stoked.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.880
 Nice.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.960
 Greg, I see you've put a kickstand on your cell phone.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.440
 So I could read my notes.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.440
 I didn't realize your phone had a kickstand though.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.000
 That is very often forget that it does.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.080
 I just remembered now and I said, oh, finally get to use it.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.920
 We have two very positive experiences so far.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.080
 Are you are you about to?

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.400
 I'm going to keep that train rolling.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.400
 Nice.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.080
 I don't have anything to bitch about right now.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.280
 I have some high prey.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.280
 For what?

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.480
 What is it Greg?

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.480
 Two things.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.720
 Well, I'll start with the first one.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:08.240
 That is dipping into some new territory we haven't really discussed before on a podcast.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.400
 Talking of course the V word.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.680
 Wait, are you talking about VSTs?

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.080
 VSTs.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.080
 Are you fucking kidding me?

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.080
 What?

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.080
 Yeah.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.480
 Talk about a time war.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.720
 Let's go back in time.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:20.720
 Wow.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.720
 So you're on KVR.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.720
 On KVR.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.720
 It's the year 2001.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.720
 Day zero, you're going to get some paradox raps.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.080
 I forgot to turn my speakers down.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.960
 And T-Mare key gen music is blasting my ears out.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.960
 Oh my god.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.960
 For volume.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.960
 There are dogs.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.960
 There are dogs.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.960
 Rocks, rocks, rocks.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.960
 Yeah.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:45.720
 I've purchased and installed some VSTs for the first time in a long time from one noise

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.720
 engineering.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.720
 Tight.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.720
 Yeah.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.400
 But let's take a step back before I go into that.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.040
 Hopefully we don't go so far back as the noise engineering interview that we've fucked

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.040
 up.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040
 Let's speak of that.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.040
 Okay.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.040
 Let's talk about it a far back.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:11.480
 No, I have pretty much zero interest in most VSTs these days.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.120
 Saying the word kind of gives me anxiety.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.960
 The whole option paralysis.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.960
 You know what I mean?

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.600
 It's just so overwhelming.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.600
 And spending every morning waking up and finding out what the new ones are and what

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.600
 the new ones are.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.360
 You need to update that you already have installed a new compressor.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.360
 Yeah.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.040
 I definitely need another one.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.480
 I only have 50 installs.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.240
 This might be the one that actually solves all of my problems.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.240
 Yeah.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.240
 No.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:46.160
 I mean, getting into modular was like something that I did because of just burning out on

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.280
 VST and software in general.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:53.000
 So it's pretty weird to me that it's the year 2022 and I'm excited about VSTs right

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 now.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 Yeah.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.960
 I saw that noise engineering had released a new bundle of VSTs.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.360
 It wasn't just like a single one.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.520
 It was called bundle one.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:14.240
 It had in it the VST port of their bacilamous, their cursus and their desmetous Versio reverb

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:19.360
 slash delay all bundled together.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.720
 And like I got the email and I was like, that's cool.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.000
 Good for you noise engineering.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 Right.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.680
 I needed it and I didn't think about it again.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:31.960
 But in the back of my head throughout the day, I kept thinking like, wow, that would

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:37.040
 be cool though to be able to have multiple bacilamouses open.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.040
 Bacilamai.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.040
 Bacilamai.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:46.120
 And do what I was doing in my modular rig a couple years back and having a drum machine

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.120
 right now.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.640
 And I was like, that would be slick to have a software.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.640
 Oh, wait.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.640
 We got to stop though.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:57.000
 I'm not an endorsement of email blasts, email promotions, email mail list.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.880
 Just because it worked this one time on you, finally doesn't mean everyone should run out

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.080
 and start an email list.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.320
 Like I feel like you're maybe maybe encouraging some bad behavior here.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.920
 Maybe it did work on me.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.480
 It hooked me in.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:15.160
 It planned that seed, you know, being able to open, you know, have multiple instances

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.680
 of some of my favorite plugins of theirs.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:25.360
 And I was like, if only I could open that, you know, in VCV rack, then I would be on board.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.120
 And then like a few hours later, I was like, wait a minute, because I was still thinking

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120
 about it.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:35.240
 And like I had finished work and, you know, the evening was upon me.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.320
 And I was like, it's fucking around in music.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.280
 And I was like, you can open VSTs in VCV rack.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.080
 It's just not a on board function.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.640
 And it's not for free.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:54.880
 I had totally forgot that they have a separate package just called VCV host that allows you

00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:00.160
 cost 30 bucks and allows you to open like any VST effect or instrument from within VCV

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.160
 rack.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.160
 It's a wrapper, basically.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.960
 How does it appear in VCV rack?

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:09.960
 It just appears as like a blank module for the tiny screen, kind of like they're in out

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.960
 module, you know what I mean?

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.160
 Like it's just has a grid of like CV ins.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.160
 Okay.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.600
 And a small menu.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.600
 Nothing fancy.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:26.880
 But yeah, like you open the VST within that and then on the side, you know what I mean?

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:32.400
 You'll just have the actual instrument or effect, whatever the fuck it may be.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.800
 Doesn't really matter because like the interface is the same, but there's two separate modules.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:43.160
 There's like VCV host instrument and, you know, same thing for effects.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:47.320
 So, I bought it.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.040
 I've spent the 30 bucks and then I bought the noise engineering plugins and like within

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:58.120
 an hour, I was just kind of like having a blast doing exactly what I was hoping that

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.120
 I would be able to do.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.120
 Yeah.

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.320
 It was a success.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:06.040
 The plugins are scalable.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.840
 Like they noise engineering did a good job with these, which is one of the main reasons

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.000
 why I wanted to bring it up.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.040
 You know, it's not just like a direct port of the hardware.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:20.600
 It's not even just a direct reproduction of what they have available for reason as a rack

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.600
 extension.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.960
 Like they have graphic options.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.040
 You can scale the size of it to three different sizes.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:33.320
 They all have their own onboard modulation grid.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:39.040
 Like you can assign a LFO or an envelope to any parameter and it's just a grid.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.480
 Like it's a separate page.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.480
 Yeah.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480
 Yeah.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.720
 But as nice as that is, I don't even need it because I'm doing it within VCV rack.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.720
 You know what I mean?

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:52.240
 So like when you use the VCV host, you can assign, you know, whatever modulation source

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:58.680
 you want to any parameter that can accept modulation.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:06.920
 So yeah, I was literally modulating a virtual instance of a bacilimus within VCV rack with

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.120
 my hardware rig.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.120
 You know what I mean?

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.120
 Yeah.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.320
 Like it's so strange, but it was working like a champ.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.680
 And there's no delay.

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.320
 There's no, there's like everything else is all just seamless.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.320
 It's pretty solid.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.320
 Wow.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.320
 That's awesome.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.320
 Yeah.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.480
 So I made my own version of a drum machine, you know what I mean?

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:30.480
 With it and I was sequencing it with NVCV rack and affecting it with my hardware.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:36.400
 And it was just a very strange meta hybrid setup and it was working fantastic.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.400
 And it sounds good.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.400
 I mean, everything.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:45.680
 So I mean, just because I've spent so much time with the BIA, I can tell the differences.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:50.680
 It's a little thinner, of course, which is I think to be expected.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.720
 But it is like near identical.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:57.040
 Like I'm able to dial in a lot of the same percussive sounds that I was doing on hardware

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.200
 very quickly, very easily.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.000
 The only thing that seemed a little weird to me is the scaling of CV.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.080
 It seems the only one to accept positive.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.480
 And it always wants to start from like zero.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:18.280
 I had to use like offsets and things like that to get things like where I wanted it from

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.760
 like the starting point for the modulation.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.840
 That problem doesn't exist if you use the onboard modulation grid or matrix.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:26.840
 Yeah.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.840
 Got you on.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.920
 See, I don't know what is up with that, but it was working.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.920
 You know.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.200
 And how many of these did you have multiple instances running at the same time?

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.280
 Like how many did you have a lot?

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:48.320
 I had like two curses going, a few basil in this going, being routed through a couple

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:53.040
 of different instances of their Versio stuff.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.560
 That package includes Desmetus, which is like the Reverb one, but they also offer for free.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:03.640
 And I forget the name of it right off the top of my head, but the distortion.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.640
 Versio.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.640
 Yeah.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.160
 So I was running things through that.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:12.240
 Like I just I was trying to push it, you know, just as a test and it all went pretty

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.240
 well.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:20.160
 It seems like it eats a little more CPU than your average VCV module, which makes sense,

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.440
 I guess, you know what I mean?

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:28.000
 But it wasn't like bringing my CPU to a halt or anything.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.080
 I was able to do a lot with it.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.040
 They added some extra features to it as well.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:44.320
 Like the curses now has on board a filter slash low pass gate and also a course like

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:49.360
 a FEX processor, all of which are multi mode, like can do high pass low pass.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:54.000
 So the course has like type one type two.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 So that's kind of cool.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.440
 You know, like they expanded upon it a little bit and it sounded solid.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.760
 So I have no complaints there.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:07.840
 And for the price, you know, it's not the cheapest VST, but like.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.840
 Right.

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.320
 But if you had all of those, if you bought all of that hardware, you'd be in thousands

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.320
 of dollars.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.320
 Thousands of dollars.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.320
 Right.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.320
 I tried to estimate it when I had like a good drum machine patch going the other day.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.640
 I was like, this I think would literally cost me about 10 grand.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:27.400
 I mean, since I've been trying to keep things more economical lately, you know what I mean?

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.360
 And offset things from my hardware to VCB.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.040
 One of the things that I was missing the most was voices.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.040
 Yeah.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.040
 You know what I mean?

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.040
 Like I was offloading a lot of utility.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.040
 Like I think I talked about in the previous episode.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.040
 Yeah.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.040
 Yeah.

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.760
 Sequencing, utility, modulation, all that was going to be C.V.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.280
 Whereas a lot of the sound sources and voices I was trying to keep as hardware.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.160
 This has opened up a whole new door.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.160
 You know what I mean?

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.160
 Because I'm like really familiar with the noise engineering stuff.

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.200
 It sounds close enough.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:03.320
 This was like the missing link I think that I've been looking for to really keep things

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:08.960
 cost effective and to be able to push this hybrid set up further.

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:13.440
 Now, has this made you look at other VSTs?

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.440
 Already?

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.440
 With a new i-install reactor.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.880
 And I was opening it within V C V rack.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.880
 Oh shit.

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.880
 God damn.

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.200
 Like this whole different fucking rabbit hole that I really didn't want to go.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.560
 Trying to stay productive.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.560
 You know?

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.560
 Right.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.200
 So your next record is in ten years, eleven years from now?

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:37.440
 I'm at least trying to finish this EP before I go off the rails in a different direction.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.440
 Yeah.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.920
 Like I have a system that I'm using to work on these tracks.

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.400
 I'm trying to keep it to that system.

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.600
 I didn't want to deviate off of it even enough.

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.280
 Like I didn't want to get distracted by these noise engineering.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.280
 Yeah.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.760
 I was like I know this is going to derail me and it did.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.880
 I spent a whole weekend fucking with it instead of finishing the track that I was already

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.880
 working on.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:02.760
 However, I've already like quickly figured out how to integrate it into that system

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.760
 that I was already using.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.760
 Oh that's awesome.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:05.760
 Yeah.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.280
 It's less of a distraction and more like actually helping me progress the album.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.280
 So yeah.

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.160
 Oh that's really cool.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.480
 But I don't want to go beyond that.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.800
 Like as soon as I found myself like fucking around and reactor again I was like no.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.080
 I was like what am I doing?

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.320
 This needs to wait.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.720
 Like I can explore this some other time.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.240
 Need a stay productive.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.480
 That's how this sequencer is.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:33.520
 It's been accelerating things whereas the MC 707 quite the opposite.

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.000
 You want to talk about the MC07?

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.800
 Oh you want to still roll on this?

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800
 Yeah.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.200
 I was just bringing up the noise engineering stuff.

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.200
 Yeah.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:45.120
 It's something that at first glance I thought I had zero interest in and it doesn't really

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.600
 like taking my setup to a whole different level of productivity in about one week's worth

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.200
 of time.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.200
 Yeah.

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.720
 Just wanted to bring it up.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.720
 Yeah.

00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:00.720
 I saw those two and was similarly interested but I don't have like I'm not using VCV rack

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:05.560
 so I'd have to like sequence them in Ableton and that opens up like similar worm holes.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.520
 Yeah going back into the box more than you want.

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.520
 Exactly.

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.240
 So you're on your print out there.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.240
 Yeah.

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.120
 So fucking looping right?

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:21.280
 So I got it in my stupid head that I wanted Ableton like functionality in a live set.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.280
 Which I kind of do.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.280
 You know loops are useful.

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.960
 You've been pursuing this for a while now.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.280
 Been pursuing this for a minute.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.280
 And you do have that loop or pedal that you've been using.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.280
 Yeah RC505.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.280
 Yeah.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.560
 We'll definitely get to that too.

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.760
 RC505 does the trick and I was like huh.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.960
 Like a lot of more effects would be cool to actually be able to see a grid of things.

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:43.880
 The RC505 you kind of got to know which preset you want to use.

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.760
 I'd have to keep a piece of paper to keep track.

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:50.680
 And I was like oh shit that a Kai force like Ansem like works for Ansem right?

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.080
 It's got to be able to work for me.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.520
 So got in a Kai force.

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.720
 First one got fucking lost.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.720
 Fuck you FedEx.

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.520
 Got another one back and dug into it.

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.680
 And it's really cool.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.760
 Like it's very powerful.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.680
 It's all like the same Macai MPC shit except the nice thing about the forces.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.680
 It doesn't use programs like the MPC does.

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:15.680
 The dreaded for me program structure which is a huge grid of fucking parameters that

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.800
 lets you sign samples, change parameters, all this other shit that I don't really want

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.720
 to fuck with and was really complicated when I had the MPC one and kind of put me off on

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.720
 it.

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:29.600
 So that part was really cool except then I tried to like loop with it.

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.400
 I'm like alright let me try to do the thing.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.400
 It's fun to make stuff.

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.320
 They have like these virtual plugins on it.

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.320
 You can stack effects.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.880
 It reminds me a lot of a machine.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.400
 Like when I was using machine a whole lot to like play live sets and do everything in

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.400
 the world.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.400
 I was like I want to taste of that again.

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:46.480
 And the force kind of had that seem to.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.400
 But then when you loop like it can't loop for shit.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.160
 First it has two ways to do the loops.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:54.960
 You can record clips in like Ableton style where you can use their looper device.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.760
 And they never tell you this and I forgot this about the one is the looper only works

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.760
 when your habit is master.

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.760
 So you can't.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.760
 Yeah yeah exactly.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:06.600
 You got to have the thing follow to have the looper be able to work or have it be in

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.800
 master.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.040
 If you do it just disables it.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.400
 They don't even really tell you.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.240
 I just like won't let you record.

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:16.000
 They don't really mention this anywhere you kind of dig like they should be a little more

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.500
 upfront about that.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:22.480
 But I'm like okay I'll go to clips right try to record a clip in everything seems to sink.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:26.640
 It seems to like you know follow midi clock like no problem at all.

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.400
 But every time I'd record a loop it would either fuck it up in the beginning or it would

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.240
 click in a way that was like really driving me nuts.

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.960
 So when you say fuck up like what was it fucking up like it would seem to have some

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:41.920
 artifact when it would play back a loop like intermittently and another friend of mine

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.920
 who got a force at the very same time.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.240
 What's up Gabo.

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:50.200
 He kind of indicated the same thing that it was a little more inconsistent after a while.

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.080
 So I was really frustrated because the whole point of the thing is to be like Ableton

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.040
 in a box and so I'm like I'm clearly doing this wrong.

00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:01.000
 I'm going to open up like their demos and shit like that to like check it out.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.920
 All the loops in the demos fucking click unless they have silence at the end of them

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.920
 which a lot of them do.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.520
 It's like a four bar loop and it'll be like a little phrase and then trail off into silence.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.240
 Those seem to work all right.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:15.360
 But if you have any like loop that would work in Ableton or anything like that it'll

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.880
 click like every time in a way that's.

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:23.200
 And it's not just through zero problem like it is like it is just like a click click.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.840
 It probably is something about the zero crossing.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:26.840
 Yeah.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:30.200
 Most things tend to address that with either like a micro fade like Ableton makes it so

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.520
 you can't really do it wrong.

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.960
 Which is great and has never limited me musically and this thing didn't.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:40.960
 I'm like okay I'm I'm insane right now like I'm expecting this is how loopers work like

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.160
 I'm my expectations are fucked up.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:49.040
 So I returned it because it was sweet water in highbrook the rep sweet water.

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:52.720
 It was probably pissed when I like returned this thing two days later I was like oh can't

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:53.720
 loop.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:58.080
 Because at first I was you know like I said trying to boss RC 505 it loops like a jam

00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.640
 like there's never an issue with it.

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:03.920
 So I'm like no this is people have solved this problem.

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.200
 And so I like gave up I'm like I'm not going to try this.

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:11.000
 And then it was some ad or something like that I got home at one in the morning one night

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:17.360
 and saw an MC 707 and it was like oh shit I'm going to try this thing kind of randomly.

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.520
 And so historically we've shit on this in the past.

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.520
 Yeah.

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.520
 We have used it.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.240
 Nobcon it was like a hot mess.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.400
 It didn't have a lot of the features like when you would switch a scene it would stop

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:33.520
 all the effects and then play the next scene and we're like this is kind of beta.

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:37.920
 But it turned out they fixed all of that like eight months ago or something and like

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:43.800
 sometime in 2021 they like changed it so you can change scenes like Ableton style that

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.800
 the effects don't cut off.

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.680
 And it was like okay cool I'll give this a shot.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.680
 And it works.

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.680
 Absolutely.

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:54.360
 It loops just as well as the 505 it made me feel more sane because a guy just doesn't

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.320
 know what the fuck they're doing with looping basically.

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:02.400
 Same thing with the 1010 black box that was similar I ran into like a it wouldn't follow

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.320
 a midi clock in any way it wouldn't even follow transport.

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:09.120
 And I sold it to my friend Gabbo who then a couple weeks later was like yeah it's actually

00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.880
 a known bug they found with the firmware that it like won't work with midi clock.

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:16.480
 Or it won't re-sync with midi clock and they're going to fix it.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:17.840
 I'm like well that's useless to me.

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.200
 Like they should have made me aware of it.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.600
 I don't trust them to even push something out like that.

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.240
 Like what else are you going to do with it.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:28.800
 But regardless I got this 707 and it was pretty exciting like the looping work the effects

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.280
 were good.

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.280
 It was jack of all trades reminded me of the Octa track.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.520
 So a lot of people right now are being like why don't you get an Octa track.

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:40.880
 Yeah I used to beta test the Octa track used it for five six years at least.

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:44.400
 It looped okay but it sounded kind of like dog shit and the effects were not good and

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.680
 they should really do a real one one day if they aren't working on that they're nuts.

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.080
 Like we've said before.

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:55.200
 So it was like really into the 707 but the it loops it works well for that but it's just

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.320
 honestly like not that much fun in some ways.

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:03.040
 So there is like the big con like it's got these detented rotaries on the blow that a

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.880
 menu that you use to like navigate through most shit.

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:09.640
 And when you're trying to like edit a synthesizer and they have parameters that scale to like

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:14.160
 a thousand values and you're using a detented rotary to do it and when you hit shift it

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.920
 moves by a hundred increments.

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:20.720
 So you've got it incrementing by one or by like a hundred and it's like on that tiny

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.720
 ass menu.

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:25.800
 On that tiny ass menu and even the menu like I got used to it enough I'm like okay I kind

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:30.320
 of see what you're doing synthesizer like the synth is cool but there aren't many parameters

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:35.560
 it's more like PCM waves which is actually cool like I like it's done but I like having

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:40.080
 like trumpets and like string shit and like stuff I can mutate in music I've kind of

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.080
 been wanting that.

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.240
 I think I've talked about it before.

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:47.080
 But what are the things that they have where the value range is a thousand like what do

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.080
 they have that filter cut off.

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:53.720
 So I get you have like more granularity than standard 128 value.

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:59.240
 But for editing it's nuts and it's like all zippery when you edit it.

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:01.440
 But then you get you know it's kind of like a t.r.a.

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:06.000
 it's very similar size it's a little bit deeper so you get these like soft knobs on every

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.080
 channel like three of them and those you can assign stuff to but only like kind of globally

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:15.440
 and then you can change a filter there and it kind of works like much more smoothly it's

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.400
 not a rotary it just kind of works well.

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:23.360
 So it's cool it's like jack of all trades master of none like the octa track I'll probably

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:29.120
 use it but it's also been like a huge time sync figuring it out.

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:33.280
 It slowed me down I like having it there for like nine or nine and eight or eight drums

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:37.120
 because it's got all that stuff on there even though it's not synthesis it's all samples

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.280
 like they were clear to not overlap with the t.r.a.

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:44.720
 dash which it would have been really cool if they had drum synths on there the Akai force

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:48.800
 had that and they were pretty cool they sounded decent.

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:53.160
 But so they kind of neutered it a little bit again electrons spoiled me there's no trigger

00:58:53.160 --> 00:59:00.280
 conditions you can nudge stuff in time weirdly like each clip and track can be its own BPM

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.240
 so you get like ultra flexibility.

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.240
 That's pretty cool.

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:07.760
 To the point where they recommend like you should probably name your clips like 128 BPM

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:10.240
 drum or something for drum A or whatever.

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.720
 So you get a real poly type check going on.

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:18.600
 Totally you can get really free form with it you can configure it each track can be like

00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:25.040
 a drama or a tone or a looper channel basically and it'll do mixing like it has four inputs

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:29.080
 and they kind of let you use it just as a mixer so it's actually super cool as like

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:34.600
 a live mixer like just a four input with really good effects mixer and you can do the kind

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:38.440
 of ghost clip Ableton trick where you can just have effects assigned to an empty clip

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:42.600
 that just passes the signal through and you can sequence like parameter changes and shit

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.600
 that are kind of crazy.

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.040
 It's easy to handle it.

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.040
 Yeah.

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:50.640
 So it's like they've really put a lot of thought into it you can tell they like really improved

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.520
 it over the years.

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:56.840
 And I like it but it's kind of like just sitting there now and as I have time I will

00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.000
 add something from it or use the synthesizer.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.760
 It's not like an access virus tie the synthesizer you know the filter they have Jupiter filter

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.400
 model which sounds kind of cool and they have like a Moog clone filter model and they sound

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:15.000
 cool but they're like it's really just the resonance quality seems to change a good bit.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.480
 So it's like I really like it.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.960
 Honeymoon's definitely over with it.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.160
 I'm going to keep it because it's very useful with what it can do and like the looping just

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:27.320
 works but even in like live sets I would just use the RC 505 again.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.280
 That's what I asked him right back to where I started.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:32.640
 I was going to ask if it like if it found a home in the live set.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:36.440
 It might at first I was like this in a rhythm would be cool and then I sat down and used

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.040
 it I'm like this synthesizer is not very fun for me.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.360
 Like my modular is way more fun.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.840
 The virus hooked up to the oxy is way more fun.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.080
 It's just immediate like there are lots of synth parameters and this one's a little more

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.480
 limited like I said there's like pulse width on waves.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.480
 That's kind of it.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.480
 Yeah.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.400
 And then you get like sample layers and shit.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:01.360
 Cool sampler it like really has some power but even when you like pitch stuff up and down

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:05.880
 it gets a little shittier than I expect when you do it and I was a little surprised but

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:10.360
 I was just pitching down like 808 909 drums up and down like I do on every machine I've

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:14.640
 ever had and you know to get certain sounds and it just kind of fell apart.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:22.040
 Some certain points that I was surprised by but it clocks great loops great.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.360
 They really polished it up.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:29.280
 I think they should redo it someday to like kind of just be a little a little better.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.280
 Right.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.960
 But the looping adventure is over again.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:38.320
 I like the 707 I would use the 505 live if I wanted to loop just because it's like built

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.320
 for it.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.920
 You got a big fat button and you can see it finish the loop and it loops perfectly and

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:46.120
 you get five of them on this you kind of got it like I'm going to go to this track make

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.400
 sure this is selected.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.040
 You've got like multiple steps before you're even hitting that button to fire it off and

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.720
 really defeat some of the purpose of a looper like when you look at like a looper pedal and

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.160
 people that are using it with like somewhat more traditional acoustic instruments or doing

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.960
 things live like you want to be unintrusive you want to just be you know that's why I

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.360
 originally started with like pedals where you stepped on these different parameters like

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.400
 it needed to be so simple that it was literally I'm doing a start I'm doing a stop.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:17.480
 But like everything was intuitive to the point where you could use it with your feet versus

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.280
 that's sort of like fiddly.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.240
 A fiddly mess just doesn't work in a live setting.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:27.800
 No that first time I used the 505 live it was just like there was no friction you know

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:33.000
 just like oh you're doing exactly what I want you to do your effects aren't that great.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.080
 I was tempted to get the new 505 but it wasn't like I don't know I still make my someday

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.680
 but this one like I have this one it does what I'm just being really picky at this point

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:48.640
 if I upgrade and I saw that you know watching you use it you it seemed natural it seemed

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.320
 like something you just obviously groked right away.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.360
 Yeah like how it works.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:01.080
 What else with the 707 there was one other thing oh yeah you get like a couple minutes

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.400
 of recording time it's not.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400
 Wait really.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.960
 Yeah yeah you don't get much at all you actually get like 60 seconds I think of stereo clips

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:13.400
 they have something though where you can like load other clips in like you only get

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.680
 one project to with 128 scenes and you have to stop to load a project which you have to

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:23.800
 architect around a little bit but they add something where you can load clips from like

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:28.720
 lines of clips from other projects or like from presets so you can keep going but it's

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.120
 a little clunky to keep going you know what I mean it's not like it seems like they figured

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.280
 out a lot of stuff with this that they should put into a new version someday because I think

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.920
 it's like a great idea I'd still kind of like it more than the Octatrack but there's

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.720
 something about an electron that's so comfortable to me too.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.240
 That's like that's what I really want is just like a higher quality Octatrack and at the

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.760
 end of the day that loops perfectly like the 505 of the 707 so rolling nailed the looping

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:00.880
 though they did it like it just works well I don't know I a Kai can't.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.880
 Very weird to think.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:06.160
 Yeah it is especially with the force where that like the streaming from disk was one of

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.480
 the biggest things that had me wanting to try it because I'm like okay you can actually

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:16.400
 have a whole set from this thing blah blah blah but you can't fucking loop like it made

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.480
 me insane.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.960
 The force was like 1500 bucks or something like that not cheap especially did not like

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:23.960
 do that.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.960
 Right.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.400
 If you don't want to loop it's really cool I think it's fun to make stuff on but not

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.600
 like for that much money for it to not do it's like prime function right you can even

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:39.360
 resample it like seamlessly and that's like on the 707 you can resample it's like really

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.000
 fun like I would take individual drums from the analog rhythm into the input and I would

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.880
 raise all the faders and I'm like that's exactly like the pattern coming from the rhythm.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.960
 I mean I could do that on my ASRX from like 1999.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:57.520
 Yeah like that's resampling is a pretty true should be a pretty trivial thing to do.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.840
 That's kind of matters very weird.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:03.480
 Yeah so I don't know if I want something more robust than what the 505 can do at this point

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:08.520
 that was the rap I didn't want to go down the like my portable audio interface is broken

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.640
 so I would have to buy like a new computer audio interface my computer is kind of like

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:17.960
 not great right now on as far as the keyboard not really working and it's a MacBook so it's

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:22.640
 just like I don't want to upgrade my computer and get a new audio interface that's like thousands

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:27.760
 of dollars right there and honestly I'm trying to like I'm at the point I said at the beginning

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.840
 of the year but it was cagey about it but I'm like trying I don't want anything right

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:37.080
 now I explicitly don't want anything new for multiple reasons.

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:44.280
 Yeah so I'm ready to like do that now especially with this arriving I really love my module

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:50.080
 I haven't wanted a module in a while now actually because I'm really happy with what

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:54.640
 I've got same here I'm getting and I'm getting for me at least I'm getting a lot done which

01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:00.560
 I think is you know something can't be dismissed yeah is the fact that like I sit down you know

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:05.040
 I've got a ton of recordings I now need to go through like the process of arranging and

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.840
 turning them in the tracks and stuff but at no point have I been like I'm putting holding

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:14.200
 off on fitting to this track because I need this or that or whatever like that's not that's

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:20.400
 not what's keeping me from actually finishing this shit arranging is like so tedious yeah

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.560
 I like yeah it's not like I sit down like oh the modules right there I can go make some

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.560
 crazy new sound like I go do something cool and fun but it's like no do you I totally

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:35.680
 feel you do half of my album is in suspension right now because same it's just the tracks

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:41.720
 are recorded yeah bounce them out there oh it's all right there be programs yeah arranged

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:46.600
 and I'm just like I'm right there too I've got the nine things that I've whittled down

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:52.040
 from like 30 I just didn't like I just want to make something new to I'm not about like

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:57.040
 five tracks right now that are like all in states of almost being done you know I mean

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:01.760
 like yeah but even just this thing here this palette I could turn is on and make something

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.080
 new like it's gonna mean to some new sounds that looks fun as fuck right this is yeah

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:11.800
 this is this is a blast but I actually kind of need to put this aside and be like nope

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.680
 I've already got stuff out of this I yeah I did get a new module and I've been doing the

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.760
 same thing I've been kind of like avoiding playing with it for the reason I'm trying

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:32.400
 to like remain productive but it was total impulse by the the Veehic oh yeah from Forge

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:37.720
 Time I can talk about it a little bit I love it I love to hear about this so I don't actually

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:45.080
 know if they're called Forge Time it's written as Forge TME but like my brain always reads

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:53.120
 it as Forge Time so it could be Forge Tome Forge Tame yeah Forge Tomb I'm basically just

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:57.880
 putting in all the vowels yeah it's probably time it's probably time it's probably not

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:03.000
 tame that doesn't mean or just TME because it isn't all caps the way they're right so

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:09.840
 I don't like that I don't like it time yeah I'm gonna go with Forge Time same so total

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:19.640
 new manufacturer no track record you know yeah no hype no pre-orders no bullshit just this

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:25.200
 is a real underground shit real underground shit it just appeared on Mod Wiggler saying

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:30.720
 hey you know this is who I am and here's the module I've been working on while in lockdown

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:36.400
 for the last two years it's finally released you can order it from my website and I was

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:44.240
 like what the fuck is this like it seemed a little sussy fuck yeah I mean what is this

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:50.480
 like I was like what's this no no Kickstarter trying to rope me in what is this nonsense you

01:08:50.480 --> 01:09:00.720
 know I need to be courted sir right I'm a lady um so yeah I was kind of like put off a bit

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.280
 by how straightforward it was but at the same time intrigue and I was like okay like clearly

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:08.840
 this got to be garbage right or something like no one's carrying this shit it's not in any

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:14.120
 man you haven't got an email blast it's a direct order from the website yeah no email

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:20.960
 blast and it's limited to 50 and I was like oh yeah I was like mmm but so I started watching

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:26.880
 the YouTube videos and I was like okay now I'm getting a little curious because it was

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:35.040
 very just dark and like we're boating you know the sounds that were coming out of this

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:41.880
 thing and I was like it has my ears you know so did more research into it to see what exactly

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:46.000
 it is and I think it's better if I just read their description because it really doesn't

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.880
 explain much at all it left me with more questions than answers the VIC is a multi algorithm

01:09:53.880 --> 01:10:00.640
 experimental synth voice specializing in but not limited to complex drones and bases rich

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:07.240
 textures and dynamic effects it combines sound generation and effects processing into one

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:13.120
 module with nine different modes the general architecture consists of a bank of wave table

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.960
 oscillators sent through a filter section which then passes into a delay based structure

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:24.800
 the specific architecture and character of these sections dependent on the selected mode

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:32.280
 that's it tells you not much yeah the fact that you know that this is a self-contained

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:37.520
 synth voice it has some form of filter some form of effects on it and that it's wave table

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:44.720
 bank based I like wave tables I like things that have low five effects and like so yeah

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.080
 I looked into it more I finally said fuck it I'm gonna take a leap here because there

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:54.160
 was only 50 and people were I guess were also curious and I saw they're already scooping

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.800
 them up and I was like well by delay I'm not gonna have the chance to check this out if

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:05.920
 I get it and I don't like it I can probably flip it so took the leap got it got here relatively

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:17.560
 fast it shipped from Melbourne Australia which is where he's based cost 350 USD and I

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:25.120
 liked it a lot like immediately it's it's still hard to understand exactly what the fuck

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:31.120
 is happening so like it mentions the nine different modes those are all controlled with

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.640
 two three way flip switches okay okay so like if one searches up and the others and

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:41.640
 mutations and combinations right yeah on so you're flipping those two switches and on

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:48.240
 top of that there's generative functions that occur every time you flip switch it slightly

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:54.640
 alters the algorithm of the wave table and the effects generate that I do have a wild I

01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:00.520
 do a question yes sir are those toggles CVable no okay so you can't just like fire off a

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:07.240
 bunch of CV no okay because I wish you could do it like bacillus style yeah that's what

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.640
 you're getting at CV the mode you cannot that is one of the only things you can't see

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:18.240
 the you can see be mostly everything else except for some of the knobs at the top which

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.680
 I don't remember exactly what those do one is like span which is changing something I

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:30.240
 think the unison basically of the the wave table oscillators it's it's a strange beast

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.720
 does it have a screen like how do you know what's like it's all in front and you just

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:38.960
 got to feel it out so even the wave table you don't know clearly you're just listening

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:45.520
 by ear playing it by ear you're exploring weird semi generative territory with every

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:52.640
 flip of the switch it's crazy fun some people already annoyed by that and have complained

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:57.760
 that you can't get back to the same type of sound exactly you know like you're not memorizing

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:02.360
 sweet spots with this like every time you're fucking with it you're exploring like new

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:06.400
 territory but those people have no sense of adventurer and whimsical right like I have

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.000
 a lot of stuff that I can be precise with right you know if I want to and I even have

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.440
 like a lot of stuff in vcv now where I can save a snapshot right get back to that immediately

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:20.560
 if I want to this is an entire different ballgame this is like purely sound exploration yeah

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:28.560
 it's it's just alchemy yeah it's a lot of fun the feel of it is it seems like it's meant

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:34.480
 to be an industrial friendly noisy I don't want to call it lo-fi but the effects definitely

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:39.720
 are on the lo-fi side of things like it reminds me sonically a lot of when I used to run like

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:45.280
 a cycle box through a plague bearer and a sound of shadows delay and create weird like

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:51.200
 texture drones with that combo real real topical reference by the way is it no that's like from

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:57.480
 like 10 years ago my bad I'm like people buying cycle boxes I was going to say like to all

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.360
 of our listeners you may need to actually go look up what those are like brought to play

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:05.800
 bearback if you didn't say related to the version oh I didn't see them any very limited

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:14.160
 run of quad it's again to you really no I still have it on it I tried to get one just

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:19.400
 I should never sold that but I'm not selling it back you cannot afford the price did a new

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:25.360
 one I know like no no the price that I would charge you which is blood and bone it is not

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.200
 it is not a blood and bones yeah it is not money people are flipping them high rates of

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:36.840
 course I'm not getting rid of mine ever the newer ones are very very economic I'll say

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:42.000
 I think I really think he was selling the black new version of the quad for 350 or something

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.440
 like that yeah what I missed out on they got snagged up immediately I didn't mean it I

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:52.120
 grass I just like but you listen three modules I'm like yeah those are very almost it's

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:58.560
 been a while since you did that old but they were that was a very that was my go to chain

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:02.400
 for a minute there was like those three or like the piss and Honda through those two like

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.800
 I loved running wave table based digital oscillators through like a plague bear and a shitty PT

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.360
 based delay you know I mean sound shadows is kind of my go to but I had others to you

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:19.280
 know I mean yeah this might be a PT based delayed chip I don't know it but it has that

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:26.440
 weird like kind of like glitchiness when you push it further and it can get almost reverbish

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:31.880
 in some ways so where does it shine is it shining the low end the high end are using

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:38.080
 it as a pad or using it as like kick drum material textures textures okay textures 100%

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:44.720
 textures and drone just noise scapes you know have bolt proactive input it does it tracks

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:51.640
 in fact the guy that makes it wasn't even sure that it tracked accurately like at first he

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:55.360
 was like I think it does and he was like if you turn a CV fully clockwise or whatever

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:58.360
 I think it tracks when we're locked and he was saying it was like kind of being weird but

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.280
 then he updated later is like whoops the way I was measuring it was wrong yes it 100%

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.040
 tracks well it's like cool but it's the type of thing where like I don't know if you really

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.280
 want to you know what I mean like I sent it a sequence but for the most part I was just

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:19.120
 seething the other parameters not necessarily the pitch and just creating like stretched

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.720
 out long washes of weird industrial noise scapes with it you know that's really where

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:32.160
 it shines for me and I think that's kind of the intent of it yeah but yeah fully self

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:37.640
 contained module the only thing that's lacking really is like a VCA but the filter when you're

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:43.920
 in low end or I'm sorry low pass mode fully closed so you can use that as like a pseudo

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:50.080
 VCA you know and it's it's pretty cool is this the only thing they make yes yes it's

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:53.320
 their first release the only thing they made they only made 50 of them they're already

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:59.160
 sold out he's contemplating doing another run but also in like his YouTube videos you

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:04.240
 can see a few other modules that have his same style and panel on it so I think there's

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:09.120
 going to be more coming from this guy in the future and I hope there is because this

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.080
 I feel like for your first module this kind of like knocked it out of the park you know

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:19.400
 I mean like this was a definite hit in my opinion I'm curious to see what the hell

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:27.920
 else he concocts again that's time or a forged time and the modules called VIC at least I

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:36.800
 believe that's how you pronounce it I think it's V H I K K yeah I'm guessing as in like

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:44.720
 vehicle oh I don't know it has like a Viking type of look to it you know the panel is

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:52.960
 just all black with like muted gold this is giving me like video drum drop vibes yeah

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:58.040
 like this is the tape that James would put in like he fell just a fail like that this

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:03.640
 is sent you down a path to the new flesh I wanted something like that for a while you

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:08.960
 know I mean like I and I've missed certain combinations yeah like that you know like

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:14.520
 I mentioned so this like got me back there fairly efficiently you know like all self-contained

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.920
 it's just a nice little noise module that I'm having a lot of fun with route and it through

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:27.240
 other shit I forgot to mention it also outputs stereo so like even though it's lo-fi it's

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:33.840
 stereo output and it has an audio input that you can process through that shit now do you

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:38.240
 get the wavetable shit when you use the audio and how does that work it's with it some way

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.880
 I don't really understand I think it's kind of like a piston hondie type of like I think

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:48.080
 you're running it through everything I think it's it's string I don't think it's just a

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.320
 filter in delay because when I was messing with the switches and running something through

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:56.880
 it it was it was proving itself to be a good fuck shit up module yeah you know I was just

01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:02.240
 kind of mutilating the sound source not really sure what it was doing but sounded if you

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:08.000
 put any beats through it or any hat first thing I tried yeah and I enjoyed that a lot

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:15.360
 yeah I was running beats through it I was running others oscillators through it and just

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:20.040
 all just strange you know I'm digging it a lot I don't think I'll be partying with it

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:28.800
 anytime soon so I think that was a good leap of faith I took on it oh yeah nice yeah totally

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:33.360
 didn't need it and it was completely it sounds like you did that was fine but it sounds like

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:37.000
 you did though you're getting a lot of use out of it already yeah it's it's it's suiting

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:44.920
 itself well to the new album which has a lot of you know atmosphere to it yeah that's

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.840
 pretty good I mean I think we hit the ground running does anybody else have anything on

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:53.240
 their list that they would like to go over that was it for me I my list but the rest of

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:58.000
 my list this video shouldn't it I don't need to talk about it okay I could talk really

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.840
 quickly about the a neepro gate crate neepro why does it spell it Ukrainian city dni

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:10.840
 pro okay which I had to look up the pronunciation before this because I was like that's not dni

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:19.600
 pro it's neepro yeah Ukrainian module manufacturer I got a crate not too long ago because it's

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:25.680
 a three channel knob recorder and it's awesome it's like an incredible design it's tempo

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.960
 synced basically everything it's got a few different modes knob recorder which is always

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:37.760
 clock synced LFO tempo which can be clock synced or not and then and maybe it there's

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.320
 maybe some other mode I don't know it wasn't the two that I use it for but as far as knob

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:46.520
 recorders go I think I may have talked about the patching panda ephemera before I can do

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:51.440
 it yeah this is way simpler you get three of them patching panda is a little different

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:56.320
 because you can play like samples back and do that too I love this module though as far

01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:02.960
 as like knob recorder it feels like a electron knob recording in a modular that's always

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:09.560
 in time you can change the length of it to be like one bar up to eight bars I think really

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:15.600
 slick interface and like even when you knob record you can record it and you hold it in

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.040
 and if you let it go it just kind of manipulates that offset in time and then when you hit record

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:24.600
 you can like punch it in and it's almost like punching in gates into it like a square and

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.920
 where you go so you can come up with these crazy shapes it'll respect like time if you

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:34.600
 slow it down and still play it the same duration that kind of time stretch it does the recording

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:41.520
 on and off take gate or is it all manual um no that's manual okay that's interesting

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.440
 though if you were able to like trigger the right side yeah basically you were just in

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:49.440
 there kind of like screw with the knob and the gate was actually handling the recording

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:55.240
 and uh but I'm super super into it it's one of those things where you just immediately

01:21:55.240 --> 01:22:00.160
 are using it integrating into things there's like no learning curve um it's awesome how

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:04.320
 big is it is this a big module it's like six HP oh wow it's pretty small it has that little

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:09.960
 vertical um OLED screen oh that's when you're showing us yep okay I do remember this now

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:16.280
 that the I love it that that interface was really interesting yeah it's great it makes

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:21.880
 like total sense um it's cool because if they had it horizontal it would be a wider module

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:26.520
 and like you just get it it's just like they really did a good job with the UX on it um

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.840
 it just works really well I don't even know if it's on the latest firmware I have an upgrade

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:34.600
 because I'm like well if it does what I want like I don't know if I need to upgrade what

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:38.960
 have you been uh typically using it for like how like what are you um what you're recording

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:44.200
 what are you sending that filter wavetable automation um sometimes other parameters but

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:48.680
 like shit like that like decay on envelopes do you see it like using it live like sort

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:54.400
 of recording things like it's like stuck in live set I think you could even um I could

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:59.040
 not have LFOs and have that and it would make more sense oh that's cool that gives me like

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:03.720
 that much more kind of control between that and the maestro those I might not have any

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:08.080
 other LFOs in a live rig it would just be that in the maestro that like makes the most

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:13.440
 sense to me actually then you don't have to like you get like presets kind of or not

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:18.160
 um and it's just like it's very clear how to get it into that certain arrangement that's

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.440
 awesome yeah so I'm psyched to they're not um that expensive they're I think they're

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:28.120
 like hard to get right now because obviously um they're not making much of them I was gonna

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:32.040
 ask do you know anything about the company and how they're faring they've chimed in I

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:37.200
 think they're like yep we're all right for now um but I haven't seen much of an update

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.840
 there because I know um same thing with happy nerding also from Ukraine and there's another

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:47.440
 um another company I can't remember right now that's also from Ukraine I don't know

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:53.120
 if we've actually said this but uh you know fuck Putin fuck oh my god fuck the invasion

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:57.520
 fuck all of that I don't know if it necessarily even needed to be said but if there was any

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:04.640
 ambiguity victory to Ukraine yes fuck fuck all of this yes but yeah the um weaponized

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:10.080
 version of the disinformation campaigns that we experienced under Trump as an experiment

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:18.400
 for what they're doing now okay so we started out this episode super posy like we had all

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:24.640
 these great things to say I do feel like ending it with um this is on brand

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:28.360
 *laughs*

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:54.960
 mercy.
