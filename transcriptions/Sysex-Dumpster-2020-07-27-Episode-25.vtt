WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.420
 - All right, so what we've gathered here,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.620
 kinda virtually.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.260
 - Virtually.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
 - We're once again not in the same room with one another.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.620
 - It's far away from each other as it can possibly be.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.100
 - That's entirely untrue.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.620
 We're still all in the same city.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.300
 We could get much further if we tried.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.580
 - That's true.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.100
 - We had the tenacity and the gumption we could.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.980
 - Pretty good distance being still within the city bounds.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.340
 - Actually, yeah, I guess we'd have the city

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.700
 somewhat surrounded.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.540
 - Yeah.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.740
 - It's hard to do this without seeing your face do.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.940
 Giving me those sideways glances.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.020
 - That disapproving look.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.220
 - That raised eyebrow.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.420
 - From time to time.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.340
 - Just imagine that.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.740
 Do you want me to send you a picture of it now?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.180
 And just imagine it the whole time.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.260
 - Giving me that disapproving glare.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.940
 - I mean, know that it's constantly on.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.500
 - Oh, I'm assuming.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.940
 - Yeah, so we are very social distancing once again.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.740
 And hopefully we corrected some of the problems

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.140
 in the recording last time.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.700
 Apologies to all the listeners.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.860
 That was not our finest recording hour.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.660
 - It was a learning experience.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.820
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.900
 - Yeah.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.580
 - Reasing a healthy stack of free software to do this

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.220
 between discord and audacity.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.940
 - How old is audacity?

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.620
 Like is that pre-day cool-edited pro days?

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.780
 Or is that wrong? - Yeah.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.620
 - That post.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.900
 - I think it's post-cool edit.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.580
 'Cause cool edit I had in the 90s.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.780
 - Okay, cool edit was definitely 96, I think, or 95.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.780
 - Or was audacity like the next version of it?

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.460
 Did it turn into audacity?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.420
 Or am I thinking of something else?

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.500
 - 1999 is their first year they claim.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.940
 - For audacity and you project.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.260
 - Yeah.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.540
 - Oh, it came out of CMU?

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.420
 - I did not know that.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.260
 Yeah, I don't know. - I don't know.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.260
 - It did.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.780
 - So we're using free Pittsburgh brood.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.380
 - Software.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.060
 How appropriate.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.140
 - Yeah.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.420
 Oh, wow.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.420
 Cool edit is now Adobe Audition.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.260
 - Oh yeah.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.820
 - That's what I was saying, Audition, not audacity.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.500
 Okay, yeah, and my bed.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.340
 Close.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.820
 - Yeah, I mean, we talked about trackers,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.700
 we talked about fast tracker and what was the mod tracker?

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.860
 Mod tracker?

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.700
 Mod tracker?

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.540
 Oh yeah, mod tracker.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.380
 Oh, the other one's gonna have a little--

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.220
 - What was the mod tracker?

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.060
 - Mod tracker.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.580
 - I'll say what's mod tracker for 200, Alex?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.060
 - Hopefully this isn't like a recurring thing,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.900
 we just keep going further and further into the past.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.220
 - I'm into it.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.340
 Hammerhead, dude.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.300
 - Oh.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.220
 - Dude, I do love Hammerhead.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.900
 When it worked, I had a lot of trouble at the time

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.020
 getting Hammerhead to work on the 486 that I was running it on.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.300
 But that's not what we came here to talk about.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.620
 - No.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.420
 - Fuck software, we're here to talk about gear.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.580
 - Did anybody have software on their list of things?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.700
 - Fuck no.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.540
 - No.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.380
 - I think we did.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.380
 - No, this is all hardware.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.340
 - Factum, maybe commenting on enjoying not using a computer

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.820
 what's so fucking ever lately.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.140
 - Yeah, that's the boat that I'm trying to get into.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.020
 Like I was tired of a computer for a while already,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.900
 but now working from home every day,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.260
 and then when I'm done working from home,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.100
 I'm just still sitting there on a computer.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.420
 Like that's the last thing I want to look at

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.420
 when I'm working on music right now.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.380
 - But Nick might be the closest to living the dream

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.100
 of the completely computerless setup.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.020
 - I feel like I am living the dream right now

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.620
 'cause like, okay, get into the sound devices,

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.740
 mix pre six version two.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.540
 So I got this like wild hair up my ass

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.300
 and partially because it's like humid upstairs.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.020
 I've got like fortunate to have central air in the house,

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.060
 which was like required when I started working

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.740
 from home years ago.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.300
 And, but it's still humid up there.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.380
 And I was just like working in the same spot

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.620
 that I had my studio gear and I'm like, fuck this, right?

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.460
 Like I gotta get the fuck out of here.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.380
 So I also happened to need a dining room table

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.820
 for domestic reasons, if you will.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.460
 And I'd never fucking eat on the thing.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.940
 It's got gear and a computer setup on it right now.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.820
 Just the computer for podcast recording, but

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.020
 I got this mixed pre six and was like, you know what?

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.220
 Like I just need six tracks for a court anyway.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.020
 I need like drum machine synthesizer and then synth two

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.660
 and effects or something like that.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.300
 So I've been sitting here down at this table like at night,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.500
 like working on stuff lately the past couple of days.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.460
 This thing just showed up like, you know,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.700
 a couple of days ago.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.700
 And man, it's really nice.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.420
 It's nice just knowing that I just hit this record button

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.180
 and it immediately starts recording all the tracks.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.660
 Like I got it set up one time and didn't have to do anything

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.260
 other than hit record and like see these like

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.980
 perfect fucking meters show me on my levels.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.940
 And I can be like, oh, okay, I'm gonna go to like

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.940
 the next thing, I'm gonna change this module or patch.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.980
 I wanna go to the next piece.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.060
 I just hit record again.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.540
 It adds a timestamp and I fucking go to the next thing.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.620
 At the end of the night, this is one of my favorite features

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.020
 of this thing.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.780
 It's got internal SD card.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.540
 So you've gotta give it like a fast like,

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.500
 has to be class 10 or higher SD card to record all the shit.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.420
 But it's also got auto copy to a USB port on it.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.900
 So you can just put a thumb drive into that port.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.420
 And as soon as you hit stop or you hit another take,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.620
 it's internally copying that data over to the USB.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.540
 So at the end of it, I just like, okay,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.620
 I'm done with this recorder.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.220
 I turn it off, I take the thumb drive out

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.500
 and then I go sit on the couch with the laptop

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.580
 and I'm like, what the fuck did I record?

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.780
 And it's beautiful right now.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.860
 It's like this harvesting session where

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.580
 I've been using the shit completely in the dark.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.220
 I realized that I know my module is pretty well

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.580
 and I know the analog rhythm really fucking well.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.740
 And I've just been zoning out and tracking shit.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.220
 And I think one more week and I'm gonna be ready

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.700
 to mix down and actually get to this release.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.100
 And I was just kind of fumbling around before upstairs,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.500
 trying to get so much gear working.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.820
 And now I've got a 7U IntelliJel,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.900
 the rhythm, the H9 in this recorder,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.900
 and that's fucking it.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.460
 And I'll probably get rid of everything else,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.860
 but a poly synth at this point in a MIDI box

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.620
 and I wouldn't fucking care.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.660
 - What's that thing called again?

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.700
 - It's sound devices and so they generally make like film shit.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.940
 Sound devices all started with film

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.420
 and audio production for film.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.460
 So it's like a really like burly small, mix pre-six.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.020
 They make a three, a six and a 10.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.780
 And it's their kind of consumer version

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.140
 of their super high end shit, which goes up

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.860
 to like the $5,000 range, like $3,000.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.860
 Like if you're, you know, that's like,

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.140
 I think they were using it on like Star Trek

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.060
 or some shit like that.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.620
 Like it's what you use if you record audio in films,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.220
 basically, and actually use that audio.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.020
 - I had never heard of it until you mentioned

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.860
 that you got one and I was like looking at the website

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.700
 and I was like, never heard of these guys.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.580
 I was like, these look pretty sweet.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.380
 - It was through Rich Divine actually

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.260
 that I first heard about Sound devices.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.100
 And I was like, oh shit.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.020
 And then I started noticing it more

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.780
 in like tape op and other magazines.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.980
 And I was like, okay, this looks like,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.820
 this is what I want.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.300
 I want like multi-track recording that's standalone

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.460
 that I can just put onto a DAW.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.940
 And now it's like, I could do what I need to do

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.500
 on any computer that will run Ableton.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.260
 I don't even need an audio interface,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
 even though this thing will work that way.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.020
 Before it was always like this.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.780
 I had to have this low latency audio interface

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.620
 so I can do this.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.620
 Like I give up things like overdubs,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.180
 but like shit, I can just line that up

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.700
 in Ableton and do it anyway now.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.460
 Like that's not like, I'm not even sweating that.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.140
 Like DAWs are like, it's perfect for that, you know?

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.420
 So I don't have like the synced MIDI

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.380
 of what I was doing before,

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.940
 but I just use the clock of the rhythm into the modular.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.020
 And the in all rhythm clock is like super dead on solid

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.900
 and always has been.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.460
 So that shit like lines up perfectly in the eloquencer

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.300
 as my main sequence are driving the voltage lab

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.300
 and the 301.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.460
 And it's just like, well, these are the limits

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.740
 that you should set for yourself.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.020
 It's just fucking so perfect.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.900
 - So you send a MIDI clock from the rhythm now

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.020
 to like everything?

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.540
 - Yeah, it goes into the one new MIDI interface

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.940
 on the 7U, on the IntelliJel.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.740
 And that goes to the eloquencer clock.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.140
 It goes to the four millisecond peg,

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.140
 ping inputs to like clock those modulators

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.740
 and then just wherever else it needs to go from there.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.220
 - Seems stable.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.300
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.300
 Totally super dead on as tight as anything else

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.460
 I've ever used, like hardware stable, you know?

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.060
 It's nice.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.660
 - That was one of the things I was trying to consider.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.260
 Like when I was looking at multi-track recorders,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.180
 'cause I've been in the same boat trying to figure out

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.420
 if I want to go that route or not

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.060
 instead of using my computer.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.660
 And I was trying to wrap my head around like,

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.620
 what I use is like the most stable clock source

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.940
 if I were to go that route.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.620
 Well actually, I don't even use my audio interface

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.660
 to send clock anymore.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.900
 I had to get a separate MIDI interface

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.900
 because the clock out from my Scarlett 18i20,

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.340
 Gen 2, kept screwing up like it was unreliable

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.100
 and some sequencers I was trying to clock with it

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.420
 just did not like it for whatever reason

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.420
 and just kept causing weird glitches.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.380
 - Yeah.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:53.380
 - It was making my daw freak out.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.260
 Like it was, I don't know why, but when I would send--

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.500
 - Like freak out how.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.260
 - It was like causing artifacts.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.820
 You know when you go into like the OCO panel,

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.740
 you're gonna adjust latency and things like that.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.380
 Didn't matter what latency I'd put it at.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.300
 If I was running MIDI clock out of this thing,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.500
 it would cause spikes in the latency on occasion.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.500
 Like just very intermittent spikes.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.860
 Like the CPU would just spike up for a second

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.900
 and cause hitches and things like that.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.980
 And it took me forever to figure out

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.700
 what the hell was causing it.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.900
 'Cause like I thought it was like a problem on my computer,

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.860
 you know, but I had rebuilt my entire desktop

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.220
 a couple months ago and the problem persisted.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.140
 So I was like, okay, clearly it wasn't anything

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.500
 on my computer, which, so then I just started going piece

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.140
 by piece and I figured out it was MIDI out of my interface.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:50.140
 So I disabled it and I'm using a Roland little like USB interface

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.500
 to send MIDI clock out separately from my audio interface

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.900
 and everything's been smooth since.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.020
 So focus rate kind of sucks.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.940
 - I've never had good luck with using a computer for MIDI out.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.340
 Even MIDI in has been temperamental.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.580
 I mean, nothing compared to like actually having a piece

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.020
 of hardware, either the electron.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.100
 I think I'd rather have an electron doing the master clock,

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.380
 master sequence. - Really?

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.380
 - It's more reliable.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.620
 Oh yeah, no, this is, I've always had a problem with computer

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.380
 and it's always been nothing as dramatic

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.660
 as what you just described.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.500
 - I can't even get-- - And I'm sure

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.620
 like I've always had problems.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.420
 - I can't even get the Gmail app to successfully tell me

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.740
 if I have a fucking email or not.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.820
 Like they have broken that and fixed it in the changelock

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.500
 so many fucking times that I'm just like,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.060
 oh you're never, you can't tell me

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.860
 how many fucking emails I have.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.340
 Like I don't, there are too many layers

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.260
 for USB MIDI to ever work.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.140
 It's just like, it's like Bluetooth, you know?

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.140
 It's like, oh, there are like 10 implementations

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.500
 of these four different specs.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.340
 Like you fucked up, you know?

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.700
 - And it's just like software in general.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.620
 I mean, there's just so many layers of abstraction

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.820
 on top of every piece of software we use.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.820
 And at some point, a piece of hardware

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.620
 will eventually get an instruction

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.900
 but it's gone through libraries and abstractions.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.780
 And it's a miracle any of the stuff works at all,

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.340
 let alone something that's so highly relying on timing,

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.380
 real time processing like MIDI.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.820
 - I've always kind of been the opposite.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.860
 Like you guys are well more versed in MIDI on hardware

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.700
 than I am.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.340
 Like I tend to not even touch it on hardware ever.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.180
 Like--

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.580
 - Did you have like a bad experience with it?

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.420
 'Cause I mean--

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.700
 - No, it just, it wasn't the way I worked.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.420
 Like from the time I've ever started making computer music

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.620
 I've used my computer for recording.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.500
 And it's always been my thing.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.460
 Like as soon as I hit play or record on the computer,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.700
 I want everything else to just be in sync

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.420
 and coming into the computer for recording.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.600
 Multi-tracked out.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.420
 And yeah, it's been like 15 years of the same bullshit.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:58.180
 So I'm kind of finally wanting to shift gears a little bit

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.540
 and maybe go like Nick is saying,

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.700
 you know, go a hardware route here

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.860
 and just sync everything outside of the computer,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.340
 record everything outside of the computer

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:11.340
 and only use computer for layering the final recorded results.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.860
 - Yeah, if I could just get down to just doing arranging

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.140
 and I kind of am.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.980
 The last bit really for me is I still record in Ableton

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.700
 and then do arrangement in it.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.980
 But if I could even remove recording

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.860
 and literally just had, you know,

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.420
 throw these things into Ableton and just do arrangements.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.220
 That would be super okay with that.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.060
 - That's where I'm going.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.220
 I'll always arrange Ableton at this point

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.060
 unless something drastically changes.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.700
 It's just too natural to use that.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.020
 But, you know, I was like,

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.420
 I was thinking about this the other day

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.900
 'cause it was up way too late.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.100
 And I was like, okay,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.980
 I have like a seven core modular, if you will.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.500
 It's just completely distributed.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.900
 There are literal like arm cores in there.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.780
 Some of them up to like a gigahertz of like,

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.020
 okay, like this is my fucking computer, you know?

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.060
 And I was even talking to the Afro rack guy about that.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.820
 And super cool, by the way,

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.220
 super worthwhile program.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.460
 And like we were talking like part of the reason

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.060
 he likes teaching about modular, specifically to kids

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.940
 is to like to have you think about systems

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.780
 a little differently.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.460
 And it's not like, of course you're gonna sit down

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.780
 and like, well, Ableton's done that for you.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.900
 You know, it's a little different thing to be like,

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.900
 oh, I can influence the system.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.660
 Not like this is well-hashed shit,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.420
 but it's just like kind of the way you think

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.020
 about systems is important, I think.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.020
 And like, I don't trust a central threading mechanism

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.740
 for music anymore, you know?

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.220
 - I like that.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.220
 I like that mindset.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.180
 I've kind of been going the same direction as weird

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.820
 'cause I don't think we've even really discussed it

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.380
 until now, but yeah, I've been on a similar page

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:50.740
 during this quarantine, drifting away from the computer.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.940
 Like my trust in it has been broken too many times.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.980
 - Like Nick was saying though, I mean,

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.820
 I think a lot of this is also driving us

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.620
 to think about our relationship with computers,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.340
 even though we had, before all of this,

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.860
 spent a lot of time on computer,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.540
 it was usually like a different computer,

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.180
 or at least a different setting.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.020
 But now when it's, I think there's so much more obvious

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.540
 that like all I've done is sat at a computer.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.980
 - Not just, yeah, not just at a computer,

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:14.820
 but in the same room.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.900
 Like my work from home office is also my studio now

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.780
 and it's also my recreational gaming computer.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.380
 So like, everything is happening in this room,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.180
 usually in front of a screen.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.460
 So like I just have to deviate from that

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.420
 in order to get into the mindset of like creating,

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.380
 you know, it's like what it was.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.140
 - We've definitely talked about getting away

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.260
 from computers in the past.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.100
 - We have.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.140
 - But it was, but like not to the street.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.860
 - It's not just desertizing.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.100
 - Yeah, it's like, it's more urgent now, I think.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.940
 - 'Cause I had to remember too why that started for me

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.580
 and it was when my wrists were fucking up

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.780
 because there were repetitive strain injuries in my job

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.260
 that I was like, okay, like, 'cause I would work,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.400
 you know, my web job, I would do freelance

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.800
 and then I would like, I remember like,

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.120
 bug testing live for and like making music

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.600
 and being like, okay, I literally like,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.980
 I put in 18 hours on a fucking computer today.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.460
 And that's when I restarted a fuck up

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.680
 and it was like, well, you've got to pick,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.880
 like you've got to find something that's different

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.220
 if you want to keep doing any of this.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.260
 'Cause the reality was like,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.760
 or you have to quit like the way you support yourself

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.360
 and you don't have a good way to like fix that right now.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.900
 So yeah, part of it was like just wanting to like,

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.460
 I can't keep using a mouse or I can't like just

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.000
 hunch all day like this.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.860
 - How much did that thing run?

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.780
 - Cost one.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.940
 - You recorded?

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.780
 - Yeah.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.300
 - It was just 900 bucks.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.100
 It's definitely not cheap.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:36.940
 - Yeah.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.940
 - That's the sixth channel one though, right?

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.000
 - Yeah, six channels, right?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.900
 - Yeah, you can get the other one for like 600

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.060
 and it was at that point like, oh, I'm gonna pay like

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.220
 the extra 300 to get double the channels

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.820
 and like the six inputs and the three doesn't have combo jocks.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.500
 Like and that brings us to the zoom F6 is out there too.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.540
 And the zoom F6 is like half the price.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.260
 But it doesn't like, if you look at the front of it

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.220
 that you can't use the knobs very well,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.300
 they're like jammed in together

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.740
 and everybody complained about that.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.660
 And also it doesn't have combo jacks.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.340
 So I'd have to have like a wiring harness

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.020
 just to convert the instruments to pure XLR.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.100
 And that was actually what preventary I would have gotten it

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.820
 if I didn't notice at the last minute like,

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.580
 oh shit, I'm gonna have to like buy cables

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.460
 and make them to fucking use this fuck you.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.180
 I don't have time for that, right?

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.820
 - That's a little surprising.

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:26.660
 - Yeah.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.500
 - That's surprising.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.340
 I feel like the combo jack is like standard issue now.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.180
 - Yeah, you've got a, that's like no brainer, right?

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.540
 Like why wouldn't you pay no trick the extra like,

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.020
 I mean, it's probably an extra dollar

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.140
 but that's money well spent like, you know, dollar

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.300
 like production scale dollars like.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.120
 - Right, right.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.180
 I wouldn't have even checked honestly.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.020
 - Yeah.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:45.940
 - I would have just assumed.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.420
 - 'Cause I didn't buy your fucking product because of that.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.100
 I would have been sitting here using it right now if not.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.620
 And I'm glad like, actually it,

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.060
 I had to read both manuals to see what I was getting

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.340
 and they had so many like this, the mixed pre six seemed

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.980
 like they had thought of everything.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.940
 It was like clear like, okay, people,

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.140
 people used the first one and they got feedback

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.360
 on everything basically and up.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.140
 And it's cool to see that there's a USB C jack

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.300
 and you can like, if I hooked it up right now,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.420
 I could just be also streaming all this audio

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.580
 to my computer at the same time

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.220
 while it's recording internally

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.900
 and while it's backing up on the USB drive.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.340
 It just like, it works.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.340
 Also, I could like throw it down the street

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.540
 and it would fuck up the street more than the device.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.700
 You know what I mean?

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.140
 Like it's really well made.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.140
 I got it and I was like, oh, this is nicer

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.580
 than anything I've ever had.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.740
 - So you mentioned divine was talking about it.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.980
 How was he using it?

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.060
 Is he using it like in studio or is it like something he takes

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.900
 for like field recordings or something?

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.740
 - Good question.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.180
 So this is one of the ones that supports ambisonic recordings

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.100
 like the VR audio.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.900
 But he was also using like their even more expensive devices

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.140
 that were out before this existed

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.020
 just to do like his super high res field recording.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.980
 'Cause you can do like 128 kilohertz on this,

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.940
 which will let you do the trick of like, you know,

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.660
 recording an ultra high sample of rate

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.900
 and then pitching that shit down

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.220
 and getting all those artifacts that you would miss

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.980
 at lower sample rates.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.740
 - Instead of a battery or was he using like a power source

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.820
 or something like a USB power source?

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.140
 - There are a few options for that.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.900
 So it comes with a double A battery thing

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.180
 that clips into the back.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.020
 - Oh, no shit.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.180
 - But you can also get, and you can get those in two sizes,

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.100
 but it also takes the Sony L camcorder batteries

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:28.940
 that people use.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.740
 And apparently if you hook up one of those,

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.780
 you can use it like all day basically.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.780
 Or if you recommend these anchor batteries.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.020
 And they're like, yeah, we've like had multiple days

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.100
 of like multi-track recording on a battery charge before.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:41.940
 - No shit.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.940
 - Yeah, so it's like, yeah, it's pretty slick.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.460
 I was like kind of curious before we started recording.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.300
 Now I really, really want one.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.940
 - Yeah, you kind of got me a little jelly.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.300
 - I would gladly shit talk it if I didn't really like it,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.500
 but so far, so far it's like,

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.980
 it's just, it's doing what I wanted it to.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.900
 - I trust the listeners know that we would not hold back.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.620
 - I saw people bitching online surprise.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.980
 There are two modes for this thing.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.980
 There's a basic and an advanced mode, right?

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.940
 So if you have in the basic mode,

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.900
 you can use it without even looking at a manual

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.580
 out of the box of recorded podcast.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.420
 Like it's, it couldn't be any fucking easier.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.580
 But there was a dude bitching about the advanced mode

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.220
 having too many options.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.100
 And it's like, they gave you a really fucking configurable

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.620
 device and you're bitching because there are too many

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.860
 options to go through.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:36.660
 - So he wanted a basic and intermediary mode

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.580
 and an advanced mode.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.420
 - Pretty much.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.060
 And it was like, man, like, and it was like,

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.380
 I know I'm just like, it's 'cause I couldn't immediately

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.220
 figure it.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.140
 It's like, just shut the fuck up.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.940
 It's like, you know, it's perfect.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.020
 Sorry, I'm in a day.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:49.820
 What is that?

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.020
 - One of the last things is that 32 bit recording,

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.180
 which I'm actually using for the first time right now.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.340
 And they claim like, and the same thing with that Zoom F6

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.580
 is like, you don't need to set the level.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.060
 And on the Zoom F6, you actually can't set any input gains

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.460
 if you have it in that mode.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.020
 'Cause they will say that like, you would have to be

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.580
 turning up the most sensitive mic as high as it goes next

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.980
 to like a jet engine for it to clip.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.900
 Or something ridiculous like that.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.140
 'Cause it's got like 770 decibels of like input range.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.180
 Which is like, ow.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.340
 Yeah, that's fucking, that's ridiculous, right?

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.660
 'Cause it uses a pair of AD converters apparently.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.580
 And that's how they get that much dynamic range,

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.500
 which I don't pretend to understand how that works at all.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.420
 I've read through it and could nod along to myself,

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.500
 but like, I don't know, you know, electrically

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.620
 how that fucking works the way it does.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.780
 - Math, magic.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.140
 - Yeah, saying that I could probably get a much different

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.140
 job if I did.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.780
 So yeah, I'm like super into it.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.100
 I'm sorry that you now want to spend like a lot of money.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.540
 - Yeah, and this is the wrong time to have

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.540
 that discussion with me too.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:02.540
 'Cause I'm like, I'm like, I'm elbow deep in rearranging

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.980
 and rewiring my studio right now.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.660
 Like trying to rework my entire workflow basically.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.740
 - I, that is so weird, 'cause we didn't talk about this.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.860
 And I did the same thing.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.700
 - Yeah, it's like I just finished it.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.140
 - Seems like all three of us are in sync.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.540
 - It's a little creepy actually.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.260
 And yeah, it was just like, I woke up one day and was like,

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.740
 I don't like this.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.940
 It wasn't like I had this like grand plan.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.300
 I haven't been thinking about it for a long time.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.620
 I just like woke up and looked at it.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.020
 I'm like, no, this isn't right.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.180
 - No, I'm the exact same way I did.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:39.780
 - Unplugged everything, took like every power cord,

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.980
 every audio cable,

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.140
 got rid of the like the patch bay just,

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.940
 and just started putting it back up and was like,

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.020
 no, you should be here.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.300
 And you should be here and you should be here.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.660
 And then it was like a weekend.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.300
 And at the end of it, I'm like, oh, yeah,

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.700
 this is what it should have been all along.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.860
 And now I'm super happy with it.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.500
 And like even just having finished that,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.300
 just now I've been like doing a ton of shit.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.380
 - Yeah, the weekend I picked to do that was this one.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.340
 'Cause I was like, I got a three day weekend for the holiday.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.140
 I'm gonna use that opportunity to just rewire, rework,

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.220
 everything.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.620
 I did the same thing, put the patch bay in the closet,

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.900
 got a line mixer that I'm now utilizing

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.140
 every single input and output on it.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:26.380
 So it was 10 inputs, two auxiliary sends,

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.220
 one balanced XLR out.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.860
 So I'm using that to it's like full capacity.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.060
 And I'm thinking about getting a second one.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.220
 And you know, just figuring out where things need to be,

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.620
 like gear wise and within the modular.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.300
 I was rethinking where things should be in the modular

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.700
 stuff like that, coming up with like a better workflow.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.740
 - I think mine may have actually been prompted

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:53.540
 by getting a pallet, one of the intelligel pallet cases

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.700
 to go at my seven U.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.540
 - Same here.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.860
 - So I had things kind of like spread out

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.780
 in like a couple of these tiny like four M.S. pods.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.700
 And the pods themselves were fine, whatever,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.700
 but I was getting noise out of them.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.380
 And I was like, okay, I'm gonna get a pallet.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.380
 And then once I got that, I was like,

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.500
 oh, I think that just kicked my brain into,

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.140
 we were gonna reorganize this, don't stop there.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.260
 - I did the same.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.180
 - That's really fucking weird, man,

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.820
 because I also did the same.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.260
 Last week I mentioned I was gonna swap out

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.780
 the power supplies and my dope for cases again.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.380
 And that was like what initiated this whole thing.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.380
 Like I did the surgery on my second P9 case,

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.380
 got a PSU three in there, eliminated any noise,

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.900
 got enough power to run everything now.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.060
 And that just like started a chain reaction in my brain

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.140
 of like getting everything else in order.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.660
 Like how we were talking earlier, like it's hard

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.460
 to get into the flow when you're also like

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.900
 doing everything else in the same space

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.300
 and starting at a screen and all that.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.020
 So I wanted to come up with a workflow that has like

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:01.140
 is fluid in the most minimal amount of preparation required

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.780
 to get into the groove of creating, recording, editing.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.900
 So I wanted to make sure everything was like set up for that.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.740
 Eliminate things that have too much menu diving

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.260
 which I hate, eliminate anything that just has

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:18.220
 too many key combos or just I'm tired of having to memorize

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.620
 or reference a manual for every little module

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.180
 because they got too much shit crammed

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.420
 into a small interface, you know what I mean?

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.780
 It's like trying to do away with that,

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.340
 stick with modules that I jive with

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.220
 that have all the controls up front.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.980
 My line mixer, I like that.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.780
 I don't have to recalculate like with a patch bay

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.700
 where everything's gonna have to go and relabel shit.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.060
 Like everything has its own dedicated channel,

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.140
 its own mute, you know, gain, attenuation,

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.820
 sends the whole nine yards,

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.980
 like everything is just upfront, ready to go.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.580
 Always plugged in now.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.980
 So yeah, I don't know, it's been a big reworking

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.300
 and like the last step in that was me going back and forth

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.020
 about possibly doing a, you know, a multi-track recorder

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.300
 now instead of depending upon the computer.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.020
 And Nick, you're kind of like pushing me

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.140
 in that direction now, even harder.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.500
 - Yeah, that's so funny 'cause I did the similar thing

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.380
 with the modular itself to like posted

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.220
 fucking Instagram photo of the setup I was using

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.940
 and I like worked with that for a night

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.220
 and that led me to do the same thing.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.580
 Like, okay, like half of the complex modules,

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.020
 like I'm not using them right now

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.180
 and they need to come out and I could take the stuff

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.820
 out of the palette and like put it all in one case

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.500
 and then out of the rhythm and it was just like,

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.260
 it was like no friction, you know,

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.820
 it was just like immediately, okay, like,

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.180
 you should just work with this for a good minute.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.620
 - I am a little creeped out that we all sort of came

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.740
 to this, these ideas independently and around the same time.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.580
 - It's a little weird.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.660
 - Because also I just watched a Minority Report

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.660
 and they have those three--

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.780
 - Shut the fuck up dude.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.140
 - You just re-watched Minority Report.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.460
 - I did, yeah, it was like how did I say that?

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.260
 - Oh, good guy dude, I bought VR.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.700
 I bought an Oculus Rift S two weeks ago

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.540
 and it got me in this vibe where I wanted

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.980
 to re-watch all of my favorite VR,

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.940
 Aug Men in Reality type of fucking movies

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.700
 so I watched "Lama" or "Man"

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.340
 and I watched Minority Report and yeah,

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.980
 Minority Report's like still one of my favorites.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.140
 It's held up incredibly well, in my opinion.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.060
 - I was surprised how much it held up.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.260
 I have it on DVD somewhere, like I don't know why I waited

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.420
 for it to show up on like Netflix to watch it again.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.660
 I was like, yeah, I'm gonna be disappointed.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.740
 This isn't gonna hold up as well and it was fantastic.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.580
 - Yeah.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.100
 - Again, though it is creepy that we ended up watching

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.900
 like a 20 year old movie.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.060
 - Yeah, it's a little weird.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:39.900
 - At the same time.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.020
 - And some strange synchronicities going on here.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.380
 - Get out of my head Dave.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.740
 - Isn't it quiet right now because he also secretly

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.940
 watched Minority Report and is just like,

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.900
 and it's just like completely frightened and terror.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.900
 - You're like, I should be watching it right now.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.820
 - While we're doing this, just watching it, you know.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.780
 - Next up on my list that I haven't gotten to yet

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.020
 was "Brain Scan".

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.620
 I was gonna rewatch that one.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:08.140
 Oh, it's been a little, one of my all time favorites.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.940
 Surprisingly though, I don't think it held up well.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.860
 Like just going through it in my head.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.860
 I can already tell that it probably hasn't,

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:22.700
 prior hasn't aged, aged like a nice milk

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.140
 out in the summer heat.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.420
 - Now do you think it's just not as good?

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.980
 Or do you think it has that sort of like,

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.660
 when you go back and watch any 80s movies,

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.980
 you're like, oh, this is problematic.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.540
 - Was that 80s or was that 90s?

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.620
 I think that was 90s.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.980
 'Cause it got like the internet,

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:41.140
 like the, if I recall it's got like real basic internet

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.580
 functionality going on there from the like,

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.420
 get the updates.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.300
 It's got CD-ROMs, so that's gotta be 90.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.140
 - Yeah, it's gotta be 90.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.060
 - Remember, it gets a little brain scan disc.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.180
 - Oh my God, it's 94, I was way the fuck.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.700
 (laughing)

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.260
 I seriously thought that was an 80s movie.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.220
 - I mean, it's fucking Eddie Furlong,

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.860
 so it's gotta be really 90.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.700
 - That should have been my first clue.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.540
 Yeah.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.900
 - Well, Terminator 2 was 91.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.780
 - Yeah, that was the, that was the start of his career, dude.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.900
 T2, brain scan, pet cemetery 2.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.620
 Ah, better stop, we're gonna veer off

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.860
 into like a horror movie podcast.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:19.860
 - Does it just end there?

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.140
 I mean, I don't think,

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.300
 - Yeah, it might be at that point.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.220
 We might have just summed up his career.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.780
 - So wait, what were we talking about before we start talk?

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.580
 Like this is-- - Virtual reality.

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.780
 (laughing)

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.740
 - While we're in a virtual reality right now.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.260
 - While we're in a simulation.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.620
 (sighing)

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.380
 - 2020 is complicated.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.820
 (laughing)

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.260
 - Honestly though, I feel like me getting virtual reality

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.180
 finally, the timing couldn't have been any fucking better.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:55.180
 Like it is, it's like the perfect social escape

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.500
 when you can't be social, you know?

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.060
 Like, I don't know about many other areas,

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:05.780
 but our county right now is back on lockdown.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.700
 So many other people probably aren't, but yeah, we like,

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.620
 everything got locked back down now for a week.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.340
 Have to practice social distancing still.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.940
 So being able to like hop into a virtual pub

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:24.940
 and bullshit with people in a 3D VR environment,

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.900
 pretty weird and I think the right time for--

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.180
 - Now, is it an actual pub they are going into?

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.300
 - Oh yeah, dude VR chat.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.900
 There's like virtual bars, there's virtual nightclubs,

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.220
 there's completely off the rails things.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.020
 - Okay, I was gonna say that's really disappointing

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.460
 if it's just recreating reality.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.940
 Like the first thing should have been like a space station

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.100
 then go work like off from there.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.300
 Like don't start with a pub.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.620
 - Yeah, it seems to be a lot of like this virtual

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.260
 karaoke bars, people will hop into Discord

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:04.260
 and like queue up requests and then you hop into

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:09.300
 the virtual karaoke world and sing along.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.140
 - Well, that's fine.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.180
 I'm just saying like reality is awful, don't simulate it.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.180
 - Oh, it's awful virtual as well.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.740
 (laughing)

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:20.260
 Trust me, I've seen some things Dave in the last two weeks.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.260
 I've seen some things.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.140
 That's the funny thing too about VR chat.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.780
 It's supposed to be all ages, the band anything that's not,

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.140
 you know, safe for work or like all age friendly,

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.420
 but it is not all age friendly Dave.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.020
 It is not.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:39.900
 - Are you scarred?

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.420
 I mean, it's not a little short there.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.500
 - You can't unsee.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.500
 - Too much.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.300
 - You can't unsee what you have seen

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.220
 in virtual reality Dave.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.540
 It's strange times they're in the virtual room.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.620
 - So I can't remember, were you pro or con virtual reality

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.620
 at the beginning of this conversation?

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.460
 - I'm pro but it's definitely terrible.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.300
 - That's what we had terrible.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.460
 - For sure.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.980
 - It's chaos in our Dave.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.220
 It's a lawless land.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.700
 - Like what they thought second life was gonna be?

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.140
 - I never played second life, but I've heard stories

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.060
 and yeah, I feel like this is exactly

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.020
 all those stories come to life.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.020
 I've seen some cool shit too.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.180
 I've had some cool conversations with people in there

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.700
 and shit so far over the last couple of weeks,

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.980
 but yeah, there's some weird stuff going on.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.780
 - 'Cause you haven't sold me on this at all.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.420
 You haven't even told me it's just like lawn mower man.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.660
 - As somebody who really wants to go on a date right now,

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.420
 this doesn't seem like a viable option to me at all.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.820
 - No, unless you wanna like go on a date with

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:44.500
 a sweaty anime nerd who's drunk.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.500
 - Exactly.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.180
 - And go on.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:52.180
 - Using a voice changer to sound like an anime character.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.740
 - Just email me the details.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:33:01.340
 - Yeah, for the most part, it seems like pretty immature,

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.380
 but I have found like more mature folks

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.460
 in the karaoke rooms and there's some bars

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.320
 called the Great Hug.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.820
 There was more adult people in there

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.060
 just having conversations and stuff, but.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.260
 - So what do you look like?

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.620
 - What do you, like what's your,

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.300
 I don't know if they use Avatar or.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.980
 - I'm a big titty anime chick, Dave.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.180
 What else would I be?

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.620
 - I should have not, why did I ask?

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.220
 - But say for work, I'm closed, absolutely.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.260
 I don't even know what my avatar is, David.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.140
 When I've been using lately, I coffeeed from someone else.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.660
 Some green-haired anime chick, like eight foot tall,

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.700
 glowing green, I have like body armor on

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.940
 and a giant green glowing sword, it's pretty cool.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.900
 And I was like, yeah, I'll rock that.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:46.740
 Why not?

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.220
 - So what's with the height?

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.540
 It sounds like height is a thing in this.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.660
 - Because you can adjust height,

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.420
 there's a lot of people that are like microscopic.

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.740
 Like they're like teeny tiny little avatars,

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.500
 you can hardly see them and they're like running around,

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.540
 but then there's also dudes who are like 20 feet tall

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.100
 bursting through like the ceilings of the rooms

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.420
 that were in and things like that.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:09.020
 Just, I don't know, be big,

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.820
 but my avatar is tall, Dave, 'cause I have high heels, okay?

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.820
 This also just sounds like one giant group therapy set.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.060
 - Yeah.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.540
 - I'm sure there's people writing papers right now on--

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.820
 - Yeah, I don't even mean that in a shitty way.

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.180
 It really does just sound like a lot of people

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.700
 collectively working on their shit in a shared space.

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.700
 I'm actually kind of swinging back around to being like,

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.500
 maybe this is not a bad thing.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.340
 - Yeah, same.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.500
 - Everyone just like, all cards on the table.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.740
 And you hit the ground running.

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.580
 - Yeah, it's--

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.420
 - I don't know, yeah.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:45.060
 Facebook fucking nailed it, you know?

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.540
 - Or like Facebook in this sort of like weird,

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.380
 manufacturer, highly curated presentation of yourself.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.900
 This just seems like raw, uncut-id.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.260
 - It reminds me of old internet, dude.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.620
 Like back in the early 90s, you know what I mean?

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.260
 Where it was kind of like just free-frawl

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.500
 and weird chat rooms and things of that nature.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.100
 And bulletin boards, it's like all that wrapped in the one

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.820
 and put into a 3D space.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.540
 - It's interesting.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.340
 It's the only thing that has felt like old internet to me

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.980
 in well over a decade.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:22.220
 Probably since when 4chan came to life

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.820
 and was becoming popular in like 2004, 2005,

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.100
 like that felt like old internet.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.180
 And I know I'm dating myself pretty hard here,

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.540
 but like that only lasted like a year

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.620
 before 4chan turned into a cesspool.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.540
 But I assume all of our listeners know that we're old.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.980
 - Yeah, I'm an old fuck.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.980
 - I posted a selfie this week.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.700
 I really must have needed some attention.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.500
 I had to like take myself from the side and be like,

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.660
 "Okay, you're kind of a fool."

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.300
 - I thought I was like, "Well, like it took a selfie."

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.300
 - You turn a 40, it's gonna be okay.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.220
 I know you like wanna be seen right now,

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.940
 but you're good, you're good.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.020
 Okay, fuck you're an idiot.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.500
 - Yeah, this is where I'm at.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.980
 - Old, yeah, we're all fucking old.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.540
 People should know that.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.380
 - Yeah.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.140
 (engine revving)

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.900
 (engine revving)

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:20.220
 - I'm trying to find rhythm.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.980
 I think that's the problem.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.340
 I probably am not doing it on a proper quarter note.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.780
 I'm probably doing like one, two, three,

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.920
 and then like a 16th note.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.820
 That's why I'm going early.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.460
 - That's 'cause we don't never practice that.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.300
 So we have sequencers do that for us.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.220
 Never practice rhythm.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.100
 Terrible at rhythm.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:40.140
 That is in cello, that is my 100%.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:42.540
 Like every problem I have is based on rhythm.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.380
 - Oh, I bet.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.620
 - Like my into zero. - Seriously?

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:48.260
 - My problem is that I am constantly going too fast.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.780
 And I've recorded myself.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.460
 I pick up speed.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.300
 - That's interesting.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.660
 - If I've got to do like a half note,

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.180
 I just, I clearly am just like,

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.620
 "Oh, this is taking too long."

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.780
 - See, that's the only thing I don't have problems with

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.820
 is rhythm and things.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.380
 Like I can find rhythm in a lot of things

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:08.260
 that like, I guess you wouldn't normally expect it.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.420
 - Well, no, it can't do them.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.900
 - Yeah, oh yeah.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.660
 That's why I've been playing Beat Saber a lot.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.380
 Like, and it's actually been in the going back

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.180
 to virtual reality.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.900
 Like it's kind of annoying me 'cause I noticed

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.380
 there's a few notes that are off in some of the songs

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.260
 that are not where they should be rhythmically.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.300
 Like just a little bit off and it pisses me off

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.300
 because I have a real good sense of rhythm.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.980
 Like sometimes I think I have like

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.380
 fucking metronome in my brain.

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.700
 - It's the weird thing though.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.980
 The second my instructor starts to,

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.580
 like when he starts playing,

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.860
 I sync up to him instantaneously.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:40.700
 - Yeah.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.820
 - The second it is me by myself,

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.820
 my rhythm gets, like I start to pick up speed.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.540
 And I think the same thing is like when I used to play

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.820
 like a Guitar Hero or any of those like rhythm games

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:56.340
 and I have a visual cue, I'm dead on.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.780
 And if someone else is playing,

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.460
 I will sync up to that and like music,

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.860
 if I'm listening to music, I will tap my toes.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.340
 The second it is me by myself with just my brain,

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.980
 I will start out at the right rhythm and then four bars in.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.820
 - That's interesting.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.380
 - It's already like dude, you're going way too fast.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:12.940
 - I'm pretty good at keeping pace

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:17.540
 'cause I have a tap tempo on my phone.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.780
 'Cause when I go on my walks,

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.580
 which I've been doing late at night now,

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.980
 just to stay away from people,

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.340
 I get a lot of beats in my head, you know what I mean?

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:31.340
 And like, I like to keep track of what the BPM of them are

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:32.620
 and stuff like that.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.540
 So like, I'll just have them like in my head

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.380
 or I'll even like quietly beatbox them to myself,

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.340
 things like that and like I'll tap it on the phone

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.100
 and I'll pay attention to the BPMs and shit.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:47.540
 And like I'm almost always like at a steady number

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.500
 whenever I do that.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.660
 Like I can just punch in a BPM.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.300
 It usually is around 110, like between 100 to 120,

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.540
 but usually around 110 is like seems to be the beats

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.940
 that pop into my head and I can keep track

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:03.100
 almost to the decimal.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:03.940
 (laughs)

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.500
 Like in my head, it's weird.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.060
 Yeah, I can tap it out and it'll just be right on point.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.900
 And sometimes I can even tell what BPM it's gonna be

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.260
 before I even tap it out.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.700
 I like rhythms, I don't know.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.900
 I just suck ass with like keeping track of pitches

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.300
 and melodies and tones.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.740
 I can't do that shit at all.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.420
 Yeah, I feel like I probably should have picked up

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.500
 some drums instead of the saxophone

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.780
 when I was in band as a kid, dude.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:34.340
 I mean, everyone, that would be the better choice.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.340
 Yes.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.740
 We don't need more saxos.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.140
 I just mean structurally wise,

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.860
 like I probably would have been decent at drumming

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.340
 had I started practicing it as opposed to like trying

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:50.340
 to make a saxophone sound like anything that resembles music.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.900
 It's an awful instrument.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.180
 Yeah.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.780
 I mean, people that would play it well,

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.860
 I mean, there are great saxophonyls.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.820
 People can play it well.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.300
 Yeah, but it's like five.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.420
 I was not one of them.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.860
 You weren't the sixth great saxophonist?

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.700
 No.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.820
 Yeah.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.780
 I'm not even like Al Jurgensen level.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.020
 (laughing)

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.740
 So wait, what else was on people's lists?

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.740
 I am personally dying to know about the fucking Pulsar 23.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.660
 Yeah, yeah.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.500
 Yeah, same error.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.740
 You want me to discuss that a little?

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.820
 My brief love affair with the Pulsar 23.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.620
 Yeah, we're getting like the trailer,

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.220
 the Pulsars on the way.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.340
 The Pulsar is leaving the building.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.140
 There are people that have actually reached out to me

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.060
 and were like, "Oh, is he gonna get a Pulsar

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.460
 "because I wanna hear what he thinks about it?"

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.940
 I, yeah, dude, I wanted to hear what I thought about it.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.300
 Like, I was excited for it.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.060
 It seemed like the perfect instrument to me.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.740
 And in some senses, it was.

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:54.860
 We'll start from the beginning.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.700
 You had a set of expectations that you had for it.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.980
 You had like a plan for what you were going to use it for,

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.180
 like what you wanted to do with it.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.260
 I tried to keep my expectations low,

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.460
 but I did have some basic ideas

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.420
 of what I was gonna do with it.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.740
 Yeah, well, yeah, I'll start from the very beginning.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.740
 Yeah, a few Pulsars had popped up on Muff's.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.300
 None of them that I was able to message in time

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.660
 were black and I was really aiming for a black one.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.580
 That's what I had on pre-order.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.100
 'Cause that's the color that I really wanted.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.580
 Obviously, some were white, some were orange.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.500
 And I was like, "Hey, so I let those pass."

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.980
 There was one black one that popped up.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.180
 It sold almost instantly.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.740
 I missed out on it.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.700
 And then in the middle of the night, one popped up

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:36.180
 and I had just gotten my stimulus check finally.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.980
 And I was like, "Huh."

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.900
 I was like, "I think this is fate.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.540
 "Celling me something here."

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.380
 So--

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.260
 You know what, I'm gonna interject.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.780
 It sounds like you were just looking

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.340
 for an excuse to call fate.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.180
 (laughing)

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.500
 That doesn't sound like fate.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:53.220
 Big daddy Trump wanted me to have a Pulsar 23.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:56.940
 So I had to do my democratic duty and buy it, obviously.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.660
 Stimulate that economy.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:59.500
 Right.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.860
 I would not their country.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.860
 Do my patriotic duty of supporting Russia.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:10.300
 So I messaged the guy and I was the first to hit him up.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.260
 So I was like, "All right, let's do this."

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:17.100
 Funny story though, so we agree that I would pay shipping.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.260
 Shipping was not included in the price.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.180
 I was like, "Okay, fair enough."

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.340
 I had, because of the nature of the stimulus check,

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.020
 I had to do half on credit card, half of my bank account,

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:27.940
 whatever, so I sent him two separate payments

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.380
 so that PayPal didn't like destroy me with fees.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:35.740
 And he's like, "Okay, cool, we'll do shipping like after the fact.

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.700
 I'll tell you how much it costs to ship out

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.460
 and you can PayPal me once a tell."

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:41.620
 I'm like, "Cool."

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.500
 So he does that.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.980
 He hits me with an invoice, $230.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.740
 Oh, to ship.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.540
 And I said, "What the fuck?"

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.380
 (laughing)

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.020
 Does he live on the moon?

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.260
 That's the only thing was he goes,

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.780
 "I'll let you know ahead of time

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.820
 if it's anything astronomical."

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:00.700
 What?

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:04.580
 So apparently $230 to him is not astronomical for shipping.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:09.620
 But yeah, he sent it out fully insured through UPS,

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.540
 which is the absolute worst and most expensive

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:17.340
 and signature required, which I asked him not to do.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.860
 So I was a little tilted about that,

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.060
 but it did come in like two days.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.220
 So plugged it in,

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.860
 went to town and immediately.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:34.020
 It is about as far from like an intuitive drum machine

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:38.740
 as can be, but it's not unfamiliar territory.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.580
 You know what I mean?

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.540
 Like having experience with circuit bent devices

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.100
 and things like that, like I was getting it,

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.780
 having lots of years fucking with a modular.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.580
 I understood what was going on there.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.900
 So real quick though, like,

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.220
 are you talking about like the weird little post

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.180
 the most that they have?

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.420
 That's what was like non-intuitive?

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.340
 Well, not just the post, but everything is either body contact

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:03.500
 or using those posts and alligator clips.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.900
 And you can even use like, you know,

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.420
 your body on those posts as well.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:12.220
 Yeah, everything is very tactile, very physical.

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.500
 It's completely different flow

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.300
 than probably any other drum machine I've ever messed with.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.020
 It was interesting to see how everything was laid out.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.820
 And like once you get a feel for it,

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.220
 like everything's kind of broken down into cells.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:31.220
 It's a little confusing due to how everything is like labeled

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.340
 or lack thereof.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:36.060
 I feel like this machine could definitely use

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.100
 some sort of overlay to kind of group things up.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.260
 Like in the quick start guide.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.380
 Is a cell like a sample or is a cell like a track?

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.300
 Like what analog with like typical nomenclature?

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.420
 I guess you could call it a track.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.700
 He Vlad himself might call it a track.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:56.020
 I forget how it's worded, but you get four drum voices.

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:56.860
 All little different.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.700
 You got your kick, your bass, your snare clap

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:04.540
 and then like your hat, if I recall.

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.940
 That's how I was using them at least.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.780
 You know what I mean?

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:07.620
 Like they're pretty--

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.420
 The whole machine is like this for?

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.500
 Yeah, yeah.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.620
 And then everything else around it

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:18.820
 is how you're sequencing or modulating those four voices.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.780
 And then at the bottom of each voice

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.420
 you have like your touch pads,

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:28.580
 which are used to enter notes into the looper.

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.220
 Like it's all like loop based.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:34.420
 Like you don't really sequence you record loops.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.700
 But then that's all real time?

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.540
 Like these, is it like a looper?

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:40.100
 You can quantize, but it's like not real time

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:40.940
 quantization.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.420
 It would be after the fact like once the loop takes effect,

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.460
 could you change a loop?

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.700
 Could you alter a loop that you had done?

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.100
 Like you had fucked it up and that like was it easy

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.540
 to sort of like reset or adjust?

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.780
 You could remove things that you recorded,

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.660
 you could overdub things that you recorded

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:59.260
 and you could mix new loops on top of your previous loop.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.020
 So it's kind of like working with tape,

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.620
 but it's invisible, you know what I mean?

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:07.860
 And like you don't have like a lot of visual feedback.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:08.700
 You know what I mean?

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.540
 You're just kind of going by sound and feel, which is cool.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.980
 It was definitely different.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.660
 And you could also like record notes.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.260
 Like one thing you could do is,

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.700
 there's a big clock divider up there.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:25.300
 So you could actually like send gates from the clock divider

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.380
 to your drum voices and record the notes

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.460
 that is being inputted and you could like

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.180
 break those up in weird ways using other utilities

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.180
 that's on there.

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.100
 - So the way are these loops notes or are they actual samples?

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.140
 Like if you do a bunch of this looping

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.500
 and you make a bunch of these recordings

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:43.300
 and you go, wait, this now the sound doesn't sound right

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.700
 and you make an adjustment.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.460
 - There's no sample, it's all analog.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:49.020
 So-- - Right, but like you make an adjustment

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.740
 and you start playing that loop.

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:54.500
 - You're recording like notes and velocity.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.940
 - So you can make adjustments to the sounds

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.460
 and you will now get those new sounds

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.980
 with the next iteration of the loop.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:01.820
 - Okay, right.

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.060
 - So it's not like a loop or pedal

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.500
 where you're actually recording the sound

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.500
 and hearing that sound now going to play back.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:12.500
 - So you're recording like your interaction.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:16.900
 - Like an MPC, like real time MIDI input record

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.580
 kind of sounds like, you know, hit the pads

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.860
 and it'll quantize on the next pass.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.100
 - You're recording voltages.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:24.940
 You know what I mean?

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.220
 It's basically what it is.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.380
 So like you can have variances in the velocity

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.220
 and things like that, depending on like

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.740
 how hard you touch it or accent it, things like that.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.580
 - No, I'm sorry, I'm harping on this.

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:39.820
 Can you go back and say like,

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.140
 oh, I didn't touch that hard enough

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.180
 and adjust that one time you pressed it?

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.620
 - Yep. - Okay.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.300
 And is that easy to do or was that something

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.420
 that was somewhat cumbersome?

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:51.460
 - I played with it a little bit.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:52.300
 It was a little cumbersome.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.900
 Like ultimately like after playing with that for a day

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.500
 or two, I just started sequencing it, the MIDI.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.260
 I was using my vector for the most part, things like that.

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.580
 Which is one of the things that turned me off

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.740
 'cause I felt like by doing that,

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:11.060
 I was kind of missing out on a large focus

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.420
 of the device itself.

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.260
 You know what I mean?

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:16.940
 Like it seems like the whole looper functionality of it

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.980
 was something Vlad thought out quite a bit

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.220
 and was meant to be used with.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.060
 You know what I mean?

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.380
 Like it's meant to be kind of played.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.060
 - Would you still buy it if it was just like

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.520
 a sound module that was not as much money?

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.360
 You know what I mean?

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.580
 Or is that what you're maybe getting to?

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.220
 Is that that was kind of part of the magic of it?

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.900
 - Exactly, that's like the magic of it.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.060
 I mean you can sequence it like you would any other machine

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:40.500
 but you're missing out on some of the magic there

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.340
 at that point.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.060
 And then if you're just sequencing

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:47.220
 a four voice analog drum machine,

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.220
 then it's like, what are you doing with this then?

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.060
 You know what I mean?

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:55.420
 There's definitely other options out there in the market.

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.980
 If you're just looking for like a small handful

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.460
 of analog drum voices.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.780
 - Now could you see using this something like outside

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.900
 the studio maybe like in a live setting

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.340
 would this be more useful to you?

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.420
 - If you were gonna do your entire performance around it,

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.260
 sure.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:16.180
 But it's kind of like, I mean obviously you can't save

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:21.180
 presets, you can't, you know, recall anything.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:24.780
 You would have to either enter in loops on the fly

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:27.260
 or have it all patched up ahead of time.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.660
 So you're not gonna get a whole lot of time out of that.

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.340
 You know what I mean?

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:35.100
 I was trying to think of a way to use it live.

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.580
 That was part of the reason why I bought it.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.780
 And the more I used it, the more I struggled to see

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.020
 how I would do that efficiently.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.260
 You know, I mean sure it's possible

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.780
 but like it would be a giant pain in the ass.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.260
 - Yeah, I mean we've talked about the whole thing

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:51.900
 of like finding that balance in a live set of instruments

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.460
 between like being able to recall stuff

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.820
 but also having like stuff that you're playing.

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:59.580
 It sounds like maybe this went too far the other direction.

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.380
 - Sure, if you're gonna do like an improvised noise set

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.700
 and you wanted to add some rhythmic elements to it,

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.580
 I think it would be amazing for that.

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.980
 Like if, for example, Nick,

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.820
 if we were still doing like four pie stuff,

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.580
 I think this would be the fucking ultimate drum machine

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:15.980
 to have been in four pie.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:16.820
 You know what I mean?

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:18.580
 - Yeah. - Like just improvised,

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:23.300
 very raw, very analog, very tactile machine.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:27.500
 And that's the type of sound that comes out of it too.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.740
 At least that's the sound.

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.460
 I was pulling out of it.

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:35.460
 It's very heavy, dark, industrial, compatible sound.

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:38.740
 You know, it has a good sound to it.

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:45.140
 It's definitely not a 909808 sounding machine.

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:45.980
 You know what I mean?

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.780
 Like it sounds like something coming out of the abyss.

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.180
 You know, it's just very,

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:56.180
 it's not hard to conjure doom out of it, you know?

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.820
 - See that sounds super appealing.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:59.260
 - Yeah, the effects on it, you know,

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.460
 like it has a couple different flavors of distortion you can get.

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:07.500
 It's not, it's not clean by any means.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.460
 Like I feel like if you're not using those distortion effects

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:14.100
 or the delay/verb that's on there,

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.380
 again, you're kind of missing out on the point of the machine.

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:19.500
 Like if you're stripping away those effects,

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.580
 which feel like they belong there, you know what I mean?

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:26.340
 Like then you just have, again, four analog voices.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.420
 It's like... - Was there a lot of variety with them?

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.020
 - You can get some variation on for sure.

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.020
 There was different modes you could do with them.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:36.580
 Like a phaser type thing with the delay and things like that.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:41.260
 Like I, for only having like three base effects,

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.340
 like there's a lot of variance to them.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.860
 Like you got distortion delay/verb.

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:50.100
 - They also responsive to like touch control and stuff.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:51.460
 I mean, is that how you can put it all?

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.300
 - Everything on it is.

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:54.340
 Everything on the machine is all touch based

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:56.900
 or you're using those posts and alligator clips.

00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:01.460
 And it has a lot of other utilities on board,

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:05.660
 which is kind of what was the tipping point for me.

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.840
 Like you have to be very meticulous with it.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:12.340
 You have to like plan out

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.100
 how you're gonna approach this machine.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:14.940
 You know what I mean?

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:17.020
 Like you have to get your patch in your head,

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.100
 figure out how to make it work.

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:21.140
 And obviously there's a lot of room for happy accidents

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.020
 and discovery along the way.

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.740
 But like you're not just gonna like,

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:28.540
 just plug this in and immediately like

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:30.980
 start banging out something unique with it.

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:35.100
 It takes a lot of effort to get creative with it.

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:40.100
 And I liked that, but I also felt it was very redundant.

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:44.020
 Mainly because I have a modular already, you know what I mean?

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:46.660
 Like everything that I do in my modular

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.580
 is mostly drum and rhythm based.

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:52.100
 Like I kind of have three cases at this point

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.420
 that are all geared in that direction

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:57.100
 that I already have to carefully think out

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.500
 and patch out from scratch every time.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:03.420
 Having a pulsar right next to my modular kind of felt

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.780
 like there was way too much overlap there.

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:09.660
 And just, I don't know.

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:10.500
 You know what I mean?

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:15.500
 Like I didn't need two major expensive machines to do that.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:18.820
 - Especially if it's like a good bit of configuration

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.060
 and patching that it's like,

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.580
 well, I'm already gonna patch over here.

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:23.980
 - Exactly.

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:28.980
 Like it felt like a microcosm of my modular.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.260
 Like the even call it a drum machine, I think,

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:36.180
 is kind of not doing it enough justice.

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.900
 It is a mini modular.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:43.020
 It's four voices surrounded by utilities

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:47.620
 and voltage recorders and voltage controlled effects.

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.540
 You know, like everything in there is broken down.

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.140
 Like you got your clock dividers, your tenuators,

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:57.580
 your like, what else was there?

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.540
 There's a number of things on there

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.460
 that are like modular style utility.

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.780
 - And just real quick, like there's,

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.620
 you couldn't save anything.

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:06.900
 You're basically starting from scratch

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.900
 every time you turn it on.

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:10.740
 - I mean, you can save your loops that you've recorded.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.140
 Yeah, you have a few banks that you can work with

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:17.820
 to save like your recorded loops.

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:21.380
 And that's basically how you would make a song,

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.220
 so to speak.

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:26.460
 You would record different structures into each bank

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:29.220
 and then on the fly you could balance between banks,

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.740
 you know what I mean?

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.340
 And like a monetized fashion or not.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.180
 Yeah, you know what I mean?

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.020
 Kind of like jumping from pattern to pattern

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:38.620
 to create variants with your loops.

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:41.820
 But like you're only gonna do that for like a song.

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.660
 You know what I mean?

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.460
 Which comes back to like performing live.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:47.700
 Like you could probably gonna be banging out that stuff live

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.220
 if you wanna perform with it.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.100
 Because otherwise you're gonna be very limited

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:54.740
 with what you can set up ahead of time to work with.

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.460
 You're either gonna be tweaking it live

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.740
 or you're gonna be sequencing it live.

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.540
 You don't really have enough hands to do both.

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:04.980
 You have to figure out how you would approach that.

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:07.060
 - It's kind of interesting to hear you talk about it.

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.340
 'Cause as I, you know, not to derail too much

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:12.100
 but I sold the MPC1 and it was a similar thing

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.940
 like it was, that thing's a fucking computer.

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.580
 And like it was like you have to do what it wants you to do.

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:20.900
 It was harder to get it to be a part

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.380
 of what I wanted to have done.

00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.940
 And I may be at the point where it's like,

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.500
 I can't, I don't know if I can deal with like another

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:29.540
 something like the analog rhythm that's different.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:32.780
 Like I'm feeling kind of like I need to use what I have

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.260
 and find things that can work with it

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.100
 because I'm not gonna change too much right now.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.140
 Maybe it's just right now.

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:41.020
 But it sounds like a similar like you're not gonna,

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:43.060
 you can't come to the party, I'm not gonna go to yours.

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.180
 Maybe you don't, it'll make like a weird little machine.

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:47.180
 - Yeah. (laughs)

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:49.180
 That made perfect sense oddly.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.740
 - Yeah, I mean, if I were to ever sell

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.780
 or downsize my modular quite a bit,

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.540
 I would probably pick up a Pulsor again.

00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.820
 I think it would be perfect.

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:02.500
 A little self-contained modular percussion box.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.660
 - No, or, but it's just gonna be like that thing

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:06.780
 when Nick and I both got dark matter

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.100
 and we're fired up for it.

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:10.180
 And you were like, I have all these other modules

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.060
 to get that sound.

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.780
 Is this the type of thing we're later gonna be like,

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:17.020
 I've got like two full racks to get what the Pulsor

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:18.740
 was giving me in a small box.

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:20.540
 - Possibly, yeah.

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:23.460
 I mean, it is expensive for sure.

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.100
 Like I felt like the price was a little high.

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:28.380
 But then when I kind of like broke it down in my head

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:30.900
 and I'm thinking, well, if you break it down

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:32.620
 per section of the device there,

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.780
 like you got your utility, your effects, your voices,

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:39.620
 like it's, you're, I don't think you're gonna be able

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:42.260
 to beat that price if you were to build that all out

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.900
 in a modular box, you know what I mean?

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.260
 So like for someone who doesn't already have a modular

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:49.620
 and are trying to get something in that direction,

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:53.540
 you know, like they want an industrial style modular

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:58.540
 drum machine, you could definitely like bypass trying

00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:01.180
 to piece it all together and just get a Pulsor

00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:02.820
 and have everything at your disposal

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.420
 that you would ever need right there pretty much.

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:08.060
 And then if you ever wanted to expand, it's compatible.

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:11.420
 Like there's converters on the top left

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:15.740
 where you can take, you know, modulations CV

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:19.060
 from your Euro rack and it'll convert it

00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.820
 so that you can clip the alligator clip to that post

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.500
 and now direct it anywhere within the Pulsor.

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:25.380
 - Oh, that's pretty cool.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:26.380
 - Yeah.

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:28.820
 So Vlad definitely thought this thing through.

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.860
 Like I just, there was many times when I was playing

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.900
 with it and I was just like kind of giggled on myself.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:35.380
 I'm like this dude really thought this thing through.

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:39.300
 Like he's truly a fucking mad scientist of our time.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.140
 - Yeah, that's interesting.

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.780
 I kind of expected your complaints to maybe be around

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:46.140
 connectivity or like integrating it with another system

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:48.100
 'cause I saw the post and the touch pads and I'm like,

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:50.060
 oh, that might be like a,

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:50.900
 - No.

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.980
 - It's like an A-ing to integrate, but it sounds like no.

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:55.780
 - Yeah, I was able to integrate it seamlessly.

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:56.620
 It was awesome.

00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.620
 For two weeks that it's out on my desk,

00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:02.100
 it was basically an extension of my modular.

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.700
 And that was ultimately why I sold it

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:06.700
 because I was like, I didn't want to extend

00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:07.940
 my modular any further.

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:08.780
 You know what I mean?

00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:12.260
 I didn't want to add something else that meticulous.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:13.100
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.300
 That makes perfect sense.

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:16.820
 - And around the same timeframe of the complete opposite

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:20.940
 side of the spectrum, I had also gotten the electron cycles,

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:23.740
 which I'm still very much enjoying

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.660
 and I like the contrast of it.

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:26.500
 You know what I mean?

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.020
 It's completely different from like the Pulsor

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:32.260
 or my modular sound-wise, functionality-wise

00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:33.460
 and price-wise.

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:38.140
 So I kept the cycles as weird as that sounds for me

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:42.300
 and sold the Pulsor for what I paid for it.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.340
 - That sentence has to be on the,

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.020
 I mean, even in 2020, being the year that it is,

00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:49.380
 that has to be one of the least likely sentences

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:50.820
 that anyone would have thought

00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:52.340
 they were gonna hear this year.

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:57.340
 - I know, trust me, I surprised myself to hear me say it.

00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:02.300
 But I'm still like kind of really digging the cycles.

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:06.620
 If for 300 bucks, I feel like you can't beat it.

00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:09.700
 It's the perfect contrast to what I was looking for.

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.460
 I didn't want something, like I said,

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:14.300
 that felt like an extension of my modular.

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.860
 I wanted something different.

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:19.380
 For when I need to shift gears and not sit there

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:20.660
 and patch everything from scratch,

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:22.660
 when I can create some sounds, save them

00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:25.580
 and then recall them whenever I need them again.

00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:29.380
 So yeah, the cycles has been doing a lot

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:31.540
 in my setup right now.

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:33.660
 And I don't have that guilt either.

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:36.900
 Like I kind of felt, I don't wanna call it buyer's remorse

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.060
 when I bought the Pulsor, but I was like,

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:43.780
 I just, it kind of, it was hard for me to justify

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.140
 having it knowing how much it cost and what it was doing

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.180
 and that there was overlap in the studio.

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:51.180
 But yeah, I kind of felt unburdened when I sold it,

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.020
 to be honest.

00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.900
 - That makes sense too.

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:57.220
 - Yeah, like it felt like when I spent a lot of money

00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:01.860
 on something, I put this weight on myself to,

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:02.700
 yeah, you know what I mean?

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.580
 To make sure that I'm getting my money's worth

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:08.700
 and that I'm not just like spending my money for no reason.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:12.260
 Like I gotta be getting my value out of it and.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.980
 - Yeah, I still have a Jupiter 6 upstairs

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.460
 that I never use.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:19.020
 It needs to have like repairs done on it,

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:21.580
 but like I can't make that happen right now.

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:24.140
 Granted, I paid $700 for that synth,

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.140
 not nearly what it could be sold for,

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.420
 but it bugs me that it sits up there.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.740
 Someone could be fucking using it and that's,

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:34.100
 I don't know if I would be me if it was working right now.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.180
 You know?

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:37.820
 - Yeah, I think it's a great machine.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.300
 I don't wanna dissuade anyone from checking it out.

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:41.140
 You know?

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:41.980
 - I don't think you have either.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.420
 'Cause as you're describing this,

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.780
 like I'm sitting here going like, oh man, that wouldn't.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.380
 Sounds like something I should check out.

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.900
 This sounds like an amazing fucking machine

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.780
 just wasn't for you.

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.900
 - Yeah, I mean, it all comes back to what I was saying earlier.

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:57.140
 Like I'm putting a lot of thought and effort

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.540
 into workflow right now.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:02.260
 And I felt like A, there was too much redundancy there

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:04.420
 and B just didn't fit the workflow.

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:08.140
 It's not that the machine didn't fit my studio

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.500
 or the sound didn't fit me.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.980
 Like quite the contrary, I feel like it was

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.900
 almost a perfect fit for me.

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:18.620
 Sound wise, like I spent a lot of effort

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.420
 trying to make things kind of sound that way.

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:25.500
 And Vlad just has it all there, ready to be tapped into.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.140
 It's pretty convenient, you know?

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:33.580
 But yeah, it's all just a workflow thing.

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:34.420
 - Well, it's cool.

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.140
 I mean, now there's another one out there in the wild.

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.220
 Maybe someone's gonna get this in,

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.460
 make sure that we wanna hear.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.900
 - Yeah, I mean, I hope.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.340
 There also seems to be a lot of people who aren't,

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:46.020
 who are just skimming the surface with it.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.100
 Like I was watching a lot of YouTube demos

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.780
 and there's a lot of people who are just doing

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.860
 like the very base thing with it.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.900
 - It is pretty new and it's a new workflow,

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:57.260
 the new idea, like give people a little bit of a chance

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.460
 to like break out of the mold a little bit.

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:00.780
 - I did see some people buying it

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:05.780
 and just making like four, four X, O, X style sequences with it.

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:09.060
 I was just scratching my head as to like why

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:10.620
 you would spend that much money

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:15.100
 and get a machine that is that like deep to do that.

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.820
 - Oh yeah, like we talked about a little last time,

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.980
 you know, it's like, what are you thinking

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.460
 if you're trying to get nine or nine out of that thing?

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:24.860
 - I don't know, I feel like it's a little,

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:25.740
 it's a little early.

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.300
 People got this, they're going to, you know,

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.860
 the tried and true techniques

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.140
 and while they're getting their feet under them with it,

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.380
 I still have cautious optimism

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.620
 that people can do cool stuff with it.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:38.340
 It's just too early to expect that out of them.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.780
 - Yeah, it's a new instrument.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.980
 It's gonna take someone years to actually get like

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:45.500
 really good with it, you know, maybe not that long.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.380
 But, yeah, do you know, like half of this shit

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.300
 when you buy it, it's like some idea

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.540
 about how it might function

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.340
 and then you get to the reality of it

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.140
 and just might not be what you thought.

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.380
 - Yeah, I would definitely say there's not a whole lot

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.300
 that out there that can prepare you for it, you know what I mean?

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.340
 Like unless you're well versed in modular

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.140
 or circuit bent machines,

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:10.980
 you know, from a percussion standpoint,

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:13.820
 it's gonna be unfamiliar territory for sure.

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:16.620
 - I think he's got a bit of a cult following going on too

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:20.020
 or at least people that are like really psyched about

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.500
 Lira gear, you know.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.700
 - I can see that for sure, yeah.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.300
 I don't know if I wanna go as far as to say

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.180
 that I'm like a Vlad fanboy or anything

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.060
 but I definitely been like paying close attention

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.940
 to everything he's been making.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.180
 - You got the pipe.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.380
 - Yeah, you got the pipe.

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.260
 I did not get the Lyra

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:40.340
 and I had a brief love affair with Paul Source.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.900
 So I don't know what that makes me

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.620
 but I think he's doing great work.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.180
 I hope he keeps it up.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.020
 I mean, I'm sure he will.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.900
 Like these things are selling out, you know,

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.660
 as soon as they're built.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.380
 He's for $200, 2000 bucks a pop.

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:59.820
 I feel like there's gotta be some profit margin in there

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:03.860
 that he's making, you know, for the amount that he's selling.

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:06.340
 For sure, like, I was tempted by the Lyra.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:08.780
 Like as I had the Paul Source sitting there,

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:09.780
 I was kind of like, you know what,

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.100
 that Lyra is even more appealing right now

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:15.260
 would be the perfect companion to that and the pipe

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:18.420
 but yeah.

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.820
 Well, I'm done babbling about the Paul Star.

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.660
 Are you sure?

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:22.780
 I think so, yeah.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.580
 I think that sums it up.

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:27.140
 - So what else was on everyone else's list?

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:29.060
 - I didn't have too much more.

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.620
 We could talk about the effects aid.

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.140
 - Oh, it's still impossible to get.

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:33.980
 - Yeah.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.980
 So, you know, like apparently it turns out

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.340
 there was a shipping issue with the effects aids

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.340
 that were coming to the United States

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:45.980
 and they were in limbo and probably still in limbo,

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:48.100
 technically, but apparently they've cleared shipping

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.780
 but I just checked the analog cave in sight

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.780
 and didn't see anything.

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.780
 - This is becoming like a multi-episode saga.

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.220
 Our quest to get the effects aid, dude.

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.100
 Like we've been trying to get these

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.860
 for the last seven, eight months now, I think.

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.260
 - Yeah.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.860
 - We've talked about it in like four or five different episodes

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:10.980
 but we still can't fucking get one.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.660
 - And then I saw like you can pre-order them

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:16.620
 from a website in Canada that I'd never heard of

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.740
 and I'm just like, well, is this just some idea

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:21.140
 about you getting effects aids

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.620
 or like do you have shit to sell?

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.260
 It's no pre-order. - I wouldn't trust that.

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.260
 - Yeah, no, it's like when is that?

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.420
 See, it's a hard one to get.

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.260
 - Everything's been hard to get right now, man.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.060
 Like anything new that I've got in my rig

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:39.020
 has taken either months of pre-order wait

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.420
 or I just got lucky and like grabbed one the minute

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:45.060
 they got in stock somewhere only to see them go out of stock

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.420
 like minutes after I place my order.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.180
 - Oh yeah, Dave and I ordered audio jacks

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.860
 for our IntelliJel 7U cases.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.580
 Most people don't know this and I didn't either

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.940
 but that actually, there's another version

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:59.140
 of the IntelliJel 7U with different internal guts

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.660
 and it lets you do some different stuff.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.700
 It like normalizes the headphone to the output tile

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.660
 which was the big thing I wanted.

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:09.900
 Those, I even got a survey from the USPS to be like,

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.340
 "Oh, this lost package claim that you filed."

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:13.180
 Blah, blah, blah.

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.340
 How's that going?

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.820
 Everything was zeros 'cause nobody's even gotten back to me yet.

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:21.380
 It's been almost two weeks now and I have no idea.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.300
 Luckily it's just like it's $50

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.420
 'cause they were like 24 bucks each or something.

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.660
 So I'm not like super sweating it

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.740
 but I can't use like two of the tiles I have now

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.860
 because that shit hasn't arrived

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:36.740
 but it's just like, I was getting like consistent service

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.460
 from USPS for years and years

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.620
 and it's just been like chaos lately.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.740
 - This is just a frightening view into the future

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.940
 where like there are no stores anymore

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:46.100
 and everything is delivered

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.380
 and what happens when that falls apart.

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.420
 - Right.

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:53.380
 Yeah, like I got a rample, a squirrup,

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:56.580
 square armpel ordered directly from them

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:58.620
 'cause it was the only place that they were unstuck.

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.220
 It took me like two weeks to get

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.140
 when they said it would take two days

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:06.500
 but I mean I can complain and it's noticeable.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:07.820
 The delay is, you know what I mean?

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:08.660
 - Yeah.

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:13.340
 - Yeah, one of the rample came through,

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.940
 my tip top audio. - So what about you?

01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:15.780
 - I do.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:18.060
 I haven't dove into it too much

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.220
 'cause it's taken so long to get here.

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.700
 I've only had it for like two days now

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.340
 but I've been playing with it a lot over the last two days

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.540
 and I'm digging it.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.220
 - Yeah, you talking about it last time

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.780
 had me going back to check in.

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.260
 It seemed to do a good design on that.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.420
 It looks pretty dope.

01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:35.020
 - It feels rock solid.

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:39.780
 I like to design, the interface is minimal menu adjusting,

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:40.620
 you know what I mean?

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.460
 But at the same time,

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.540
 you kind of have to set up your kits ahead of time

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:45.380
 and stuff.

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:47.540
 Like you're not gonna be doing a whole lot from the module.

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.900
 I haven't looked into it

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.980
 but I don't even think you can record into this.

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:56.220
 But everything is with a single touch of the button

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.980
 or a double tap to enter the alt mode.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.420
 And I've been liking it a lot.

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:03.420
 Sweet.

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:05.540
 It's kind of exactly what I've been looking for

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:09.060
 for a sampler module, you know what I mean?

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:13.700
 Nothing too complicated, nothing too limited.

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.940
 It's like a nice in-between.

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:19.820
 It's like definitely not a 301 or like an assimilator

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:22.700
 but it's also well more,

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:25.620
 much more versatile than like a tip top one

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.340
 or something like that, you know what I mean?

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.300
 Yeah, I think they hit a good sweet spot

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.620
 with that mix of stuff.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:34.220
 And a little more appealing than the sample.

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:38.620
 Yeah, I liked it over the slop-hole or whatever

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.420
 'cause it has effects per channel.

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:43.540
 You don't have to like limit

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.100
 which channels you want to be able to pitch,

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.260
 adjust and things like that.

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:49.300
 It seemed a little more versatile

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.780
 even though the sample has recording in

01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:54.820
 and some functionality that this one doesn't.

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.340
 This is more compact.

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.860
 It's cheaper and it just seems more versatile

01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:02.780
 in the ways that I gave a shit about.

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:04.060
 So so far so good.

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:08.180
 Haven't even gotten to the point of like making my own kits yet.

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.900
 I've just been playing with what's on board

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:14.140
 and bit crushing it and playing with the sample rates,

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:16.900
 sample start times, all that, just messing around.

01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:18.260
 But yeah, that's one of the only things

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.860
 that have arrived that I ordered.

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:24.500
 I got the tip top Z-verb finally.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.340
 Oh, right.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.260
 That was luck.

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:29.660
 Like that had been sold out everywhere for months

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.300
 and I had them like,

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.460
 I had one on pre-order, perfect circuit

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:37.980
 and just never showed up so I canceled it.

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:40.620
 And then like one day I just happened to check Detroit modular

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.900
 and somehow some way they had a black one in stock.

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:45.300
 So I grabbed it up.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:50.300
 Kind of, I like it, but I don't love it, you know what I mean?

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:53.620
 It's not that amazing.

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:57.340
 Like it has 24 different algorithms,

01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:00.460
 but they're only like marginally different, you know, like

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:05.300
 sonically, just so much so that it's hard to tell

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:06.660
 what is what.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.860
 So you don't have a screen,

01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.860
 you just have to push the button and flip through them

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:12.940
 and sometimes it's hard to hear like noticeable differences

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.940
 between the algorithms.

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:16.780
 That's the tough thing about the FX8 too

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.340
 is that it just, it sounds great.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.860
 Like all the presets are awesome that I've heard basically.

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:25.340
 Yeah, and there's so much variance between them, you know,

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.580
 and you don't have to be limited like with the tip top ones

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.900
 like, oh, if you want delay, you gotta get the delay module.

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:33.860
 If you want reverb, you gotta get the reverb

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:37.460
 or you can compromise and get a little bit of both

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:40.980
 in your Z5000 or whatever and it's like, eh.

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:44.740
 Well, the FX8 also has the advantage of it not being real

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.540
 and it's just a computer simulation

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.500
 so they can make it sound however they want.

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.700
 I mean, it makes it a little bit easier.

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.100
 It's a mythical unicorn.

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.980
 Yeah, that we're all chasing.

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.580
 (laughing)

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.380
 So the Zverb though, you're gonna keep?

01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.500
 Yeah, I'm gonna keep it.

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.860
 I'm finding use for it and it's small.

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.340
 It's definitely smaller than like a ZDSP

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.140
 and it's nice to have similar--

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.020
 Your tone is just so down.

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.500
 Like, like-- Dude, I'm not--

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.460
 Like, you're-- Like, this is like the opposite

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.300
 of excitement.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:15.500
 I feel like GUR just made some bad choices with this design

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.940
 as I've stated in the past in a previous episode.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.580
 Like, the fact that it's mono in is kind of dumb.

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:25.220
 The fact that, you know, you're limited

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:29.660
 to those algorithms and you can't kind of swap them out

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.740
 via software like you could do with an FX8

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:35.220
 or swap out a card like you can do with a ZDSP.

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:39.100
 It just kind of feels like a half-assed ZDSP, you know,

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:43.020
 that you're limited to a very select few of algorithms

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:46.420
 but the algorithms that honor are nice.

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:51.460
 So, you know, the biggest appeal that's making me keep it

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:54.860
 so far is the fidelity function.

01:11:54.860 --> 01:12:00.140
 It's like the same idea of manipulating the CV clock

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.060
 on the ZDSP.

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.340
 Oh, now do you have to have like a 30 kilohertz?

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:06.500
 You don't. You don't have to have any CV to do it.

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.700
 It's a dedicated knob.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.380
 Oh, that's-- So, so you just--

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.020
 Yeah, like you just twist on the knob

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:14.300
 and you immediately start like,

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:17.180
 circuit bending the algorithm.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.820
 That's a lot better than the ZDSP

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:21.460
 because like the ZDSP you had to get like a Dixie

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.620
 or like a video oscillator

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.820
 to actually have something fast enough

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.220
 to like even meet the clock.

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:29.980
 Right. So you can get some interesting

01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:34.260
 aliased, strange, low-five reverb out of it

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:35.540
 by fucking with the fidelity.

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.940
 But on the other hand, we--

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.860
 I don't even think we can give Ger credit to that

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:43.420
 because Erika's FX module,

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.260
 black hole has the same thing.

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.420
 It has an op dedicated to doing the same thing,

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:48.660
 which I liked on that one too.

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.460
 But-- So why don't you have that instead?

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:54.700
 I just-- I didn't like the algorithms in that one.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.900
 There was too many that I didn't need.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:01.140
 Whereas the Z-verb, it's all reverb

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:02.620
 and that's all I gave a shit about.

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:06.540
 Like I bought it mainly just to do reverb, you know what I mean?

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:10.580
 But if it had stereo in, which the Erika did,

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:12.260
 I would be way more into it.

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.940
 Like the way that I've readjusted my workflow,

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.460
 like everything at the end of chain

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.860
 goes through the modular at some point.

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:24.660
 So having a reverb unit that I can't really use

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:29.180
 for external stereo processing just feels stupid to me

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.580
 in the year 2020, like there's absolutely no reason

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:36.420
 why you can't have a stereo input on that thing.

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.460
 Maybe it saves a few bucks, I don't know,

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.420
 but I would have gladly spent a few extra bucks

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:43.180
 to have that capability.

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.740
 Everything else that I've ordered recently

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:49.740
 is still up in the air, still waiting on the reminder,

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:54.420
 still waiting on the flex temporal sequencer.

01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:56.460
 Got a few other things up in the air too.

01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:58.100
 Just waiting for them to come.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.700
 So the theme of this episode is just you

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:03.820
 looking longingly out of the front window.

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:07.580
 And like some sort of like postal truck starts to drive by

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.740
 and you're like a dog, you start panting.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:12.060
 But it's not for you, it's for one of your neighbors

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:12.780
 and then you.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:16.060
 You know, I ain't gonna lie, like I've been buying stuff

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:20.300
 probably because of, you know, the lockdown.

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:24.740
 And I have nothing else to do or look forward to every day

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:27.980
 except for when the mailman drives down the street

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:31.100
 hoping it's gonna stop at my house and give me a new toy.

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.100
 - Jesus, I was kidding.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:36.700
 - The mix pre I was like, so where are you gonna go

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:37.700
 on vacation this year?

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.260
 Oh, you're not fucking going on vacation.

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:40.860
 She just buy this goddamn thing.

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:42.500
 Like you know. - Right.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.780
 - That was my justification.

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.700
 I'm like, well, I would have spent this much on a trip

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.100
 to like the Outer Banks or something,

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:48.260
 but that's not happening now.

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:51.260
 So I'll just buy more shit.

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:53.840
 (upbeat music)

01:14:53.840 --> 01:15:16.680
 (upbeat music)

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.260
 (upbeat music)

01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:22.000
 (dramatic music)
