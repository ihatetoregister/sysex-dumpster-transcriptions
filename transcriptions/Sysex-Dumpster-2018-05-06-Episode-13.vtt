00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 (dramatic music)

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.760
 (clippers buzzing)

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.760
 (clippers buzzing)

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.600
 (machine whirring)

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:23.380
 (machine whirring)

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.540
 (machine whirring)

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.140
 - I'm gonna be drinking, that's a cool can.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.020
 - Drinking still water spaced beer.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.460
 - Oh shit, that's a cool can.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.540
 - Which is, their beer's pretty good.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.300
 It's a lower alcohol.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.140
 - Where they are, where they're from?

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.740
 - 3.8%, which is pretty a low gravity IPA,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.940
 pretty low for an IPA.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.060
 Where they out of though?

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.540
 I think it's DC, but they're shit's pretty good.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.780
 - It says artisanal right on the can.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.100
 - Uh-huh.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 - I'm crafting it. - I know that some serious shit.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.220
 - Everything about this was crafted.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.140
 - Especially that design, mmm.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.980
 Very hypnotic.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.780
 - Yeah, it's a good beer.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.900
 - Let's check it out.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.940
 - Good podcasting beer.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.620
 - Where'd you get it?

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.900
 - At that beer distributor by where the BBT used to be.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.740
 - Gotcha.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.580
 Gotcha.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.940
 - Which is closed now, which is weird.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.780
 - Wait, it's closed?

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.620
 - The BBT?

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.620
 - Oh yeah, it's for sale.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.820
 Well, you can rent it now.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.300
 And they kept the kitchen and the bar.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.900
 And they've tried turning it into a bonus,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.460
 like, hey, make your own pierogies.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.300
 It's weird to slip.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.540
 - Let's do loft with built in bar.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.940
 - Yeah.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.180
 Hopefully they kept the bathroom exactly the same.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.020
 - Yeah.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.260
 - Anyone wants to be 12?

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.660
 - Yeah.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.500
 - Natural energy.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.340
 - That could be 12.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.900
 - Turkey up.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.740
 - Wait, these chubble?

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.180
 - No, let them dissolve.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.020
 (laughing)

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.860
 - Are you serious?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.100
 - Shoot the shit out of it.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.180
 - It's supposed to let it dissolve, it's a lozenge.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.820
 It's supposed to absorb in your mouth.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.700
 Like, apparently that's how you get better B12.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.060
 It gets absorbed in your mouth tissue.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.540
 - So, I'm doing a peachy.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.620
 - Yeah, it's peach flavor.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.860
 - Suitable for vegetarians and vegans.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.180
 - All right, do we want to talk about a super booth?

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.940
 Or should we wait for these lozenges to finish?

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.180
 (laughing)

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.060
 - I'm trying to get my mind sharp,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.380
 so I'm not all stupid like last time.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.660
 - How long does it take to kick in?

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.060
 - I'm not gonna get the speed of this.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.900
 - You should like, no, this is like speed you up.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.700
 All of a sudden, like I notice I can think more clearly.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.700
 - Mm, mm.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.500
 - It like lifts the blame fog, yeah.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.300
 (laughing)

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.900
 And then next thing I know, it's three days later

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.740
 and I haven't slept.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.220
 (laughing)

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.060
 - Super booth.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.180
 Super booth.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.180
 - Yeah.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.660
 - So many exciting things.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.980
 - There are, how do we want to tackle

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.340
 going through this order?

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.460
 Was there anything anybody absolutely hated?

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.460
 I feel like getting it out of our system,

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.060
 what are the things that we hated?

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.980
 - I think there's two big things right off the bat

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.500
 that we can probably bitch about.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.540
 Number one, I can see it in Nick's eyes.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.380
 (laughing)

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.220
 - The Beringer.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.060
 - Oh yeah.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.900
 - Yeah, that's one of them.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.820
 - For sure.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.660
 - Yeah.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.340
 - Clones, the Clone Wars.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.220
 And it's not just a few clones.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.140
 There's all of them.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.540
 That is a tremendous lineup of them.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.980
 - It's a clone army.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.060
 - It is.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.900
 - Which like, you gotta kind of respect it

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.140
 in some way they're just going for it, you know?

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.660
 It's like no balls about it, that's like a pro one,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.060
 but it's like, I don't get it.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.020
 I don't get why they would, I don't know.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.940
 They're gonna be cheap.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.620
 If that 808's gonna be like a hundred bucks.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.460
 - Yeah.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.500
 - That would be crazy.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.940
 - Not legal is probably the right word for this, but like.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.780
 - That's the cool.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.620
 - Yes.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.220
 - How did somebody go, this is a great idea.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.860
 Let's just fucking do this.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.180
 'Cause it's not like people aren't gonna notice.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.980
 - I don't even think we can blame them, dude.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.020
 People have been begging for this shit for years.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.860
 - It's true.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.780
 - On every forum for years now, you always see,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.860
 well why can't Beringer just make a NATO away?

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.220
 You know, while everyone's been waiting for like,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.140
 Roland to reproduce this stuff.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.900
 So like, we, as a people, have finally got

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.340
 what we've asked for, I guess.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.780
 - But that doesn't like, people asking you to do something

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.860
 doesn't get you out of like ethical quandaries.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.700
 - It's not like someone goes,

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.700
 there's a market there.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.740
 - Like someone can ask for a million things.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.900
 The whole thing. - 20 bucks is 20 bucks, Dave.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.740
 - Yeah.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.820
 Let's go say I'm gonna do a change my life

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.020
 based on what you're saying right now.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.020
 - Dave.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.860
 (laughing)

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.220
 Maybe I've been doing things the wrong way.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.740
 (laughing)

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.300
 - There's the pro one, the 808.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.780
 - Yeah.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.540
 - The 101, the MM101 or something like that.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.300
 - I mean, it's full on, that knockoff even has the handle for.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.340
 - Oh yeah, the key grip.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.500
 - The key grip.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.340
 - I mean, that's pretty a detailed clone.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.180
 - Yeah.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.060
 - Oh, it looks, yeah, very similar to one.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.220
 I do, when I was scrolling through

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.980
 like the Super booth announcements,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.820
 I didn't realize what I was looking at at first.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.060
 I thought it was a 101.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.700
 And I was like, "Wait a minute, I did a double take."

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.100
 And I was like, "What the hell is this?"

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.100
 - But they added some things,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.980
 like they added like a triangle waveform,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.980
 which it doesn't have, like they picked some things

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.940
 out of all of them that they kind of modified,

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.020
 which is kind of weird.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.940
 - All right.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.660
 And this was like a couple weeks after they had released,

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.620
 what were the, there was a series of Yurrat clones.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.820
 - Yeah.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.620
 It's meant to be like the Roland 500 series.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.460
 - Yeah.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.300
 - All right, right, right.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.180
 - As a barringer knockoff.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.660
 - But I mean, Roland is doing their own 500 series.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.940
 - So, which is powered by Maleco, actually.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.100
 He's, Josh has been the one like spearheading

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.540
 that whole project and now a barringer just kind of came out

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.420
 and gave him a dirty Sanchez.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.580
 (laughing)

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.660
 - But they're even like cloning the updates

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.740
 that people made, like they have three filters

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.660
 from the core art bodicy.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.300
 Like exactly the way that the core one did it.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.300
 Like, it's kind of interesting what they're picking

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.580
 and they have the drive circuit

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.100
 from the new core guard bodicy

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.780
 that wasn't on the original.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.660
 - The built-in compressor on the 808,

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.140
 like the TR8 had things like that.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.980
 Yeah.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.820
 - Yeah.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.140
 - Every video blew my mind, dude.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.140
 Like you see all these super booth videos,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.340
 they're in the con, you know what I mean?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.500
 Like they're in a busy hallway, lots of noise,

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.380
 people everywhere, all these booths set up

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.340
 and then you cut to the barringer video

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.340
 and it's just the dude.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.180
 - Oh, yeah.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.540
 - And a camera guy in a completely dead silent room.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.340
 God knows where, it's like they found a closet somewhere

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.780
 where they could set up this super secret demo

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.380
 and they're like whispering, like cutting lines.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.220
 - Yeah, check this out.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.460
 - This is the real deal shit, man.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.300
 We got the clone.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.420
 - Right off the boat.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.860
 - But they knew they were being recorded, right?

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.180
 Like it wasn't the one that sounded like,

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.500
 but it's like they had a hide

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.500
 from the rest of the convention.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.220
 Like they thought they were gonna get stabbed

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.220
 or something, so like super secret.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.380
 Like it was just shady as hell all around.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.820
 But Sonic State, they got in, man.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.900
 They got behind the lines and they got video

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.380
 like everything.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.420
 - Do you think that conversations are,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.820
 hey man, you're not wearing a wire, are you?

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.380
 - I know, I know, fine.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.020
 - They weren't answering questions either.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.500
 Like Nick, right from Sonic State

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.060
 was the one interviewing the baronger guys first.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.540
 Like he got in there with an 808.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.940
 He was like asking pretty direct questions

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.420
 and he just kept being like, yes, 808.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.580
 Like that was his answer.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.780
 Like he was just like dodging every question

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.940
 and every detail, couldn't give price,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.620
 couldn't give like no details, but it was strange.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.980
 - Even one of the videos, there's no audio.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.180
 He's just holding it and talking to the guy

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.340
 and he won't play it.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.540
 - Yep, we came up with a bunch of prototypes

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.300
 that look like they're functional just in time

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.340
 for Superboos so that we could make this announcement

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.900
 and get the hype train rolling in our secret

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.980
 Superbooth closet.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.500
 - And some of it sounded pretty prototype too.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.780
 Like that one at one.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.620
 - I did not like it.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.100
 - Never owned one, but it didn't sound like that

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.940
 when I used one.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.220
 The 808 was like, you know, the TR8,

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.140
 you can complain about it.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.940
 I mean like, oh, it doesn't sound like 808,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.220
 which I've done before.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.380
 That thing sounds amazingly close to an 808

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.660
 compared to the DR 808 that they had,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.660
 which did not to me.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.500
 I don't know.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.100
 Be curious to see what the prices are

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.980
 on some of the shit and if people like,

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.020
 you really want that?

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.820
 You're gonna want that over like the TR8s or something?

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.780
 You know, that'd be my question.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.820
 - Probably have to be like half the price.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.660
 - Yeah.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.460
 - People even consider it, in my opinion, I don't know.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.300
 But who knows?

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.820
 - But I've read good reviews about the Moog clone thing

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.660
 that they made.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.540
 - It was apparently pretty good- sounded.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.620
 Like I couldn't tell a damn difference.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.340
 It sounded like a freaking Model D.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.300
 - I was surprised how much the 101 didn't sound like a 101.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.140
 - Yeah.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.980
 - You know, because I figured that would be

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.140
 one of the easiest things to clone, you know?

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.900
 But like that demo, yeah, just did not sound good

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.900
 or like a 101.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.700
 It was like, I rate that has to be like 100 bucks at best.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.540
 You know what I mean?

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.380
 - Yeah.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.260
 - You can consider something like that.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.260
 Aside from Beringer, the other thing that I kind of,

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.420
 grinded my gears was that endorphins.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.500
 - Oh, black and war.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.700
 - Black and war, yeah.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.300
 - It sounded like garbage.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.820
 I'm glad I'm not the only one,

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.620
 'cause I swear, dude, people weren't hearing the same demo

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.140
 that I was, 'cause the threads concerning it were all like,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.180
 oh my God, it's so fat.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.580
 It's so big sounding.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.940
 I'm just like, I'm not hearing that.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.020
 I'm really not, like the kick sounded decent at best.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.100
 Everything else sounded very lo-fi-

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.940
 - Thin.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.780
 - Thin.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.100
 - No-fi, thin.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.660
 It sounded like an LXR, but not even as good as an LXR.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.500
 - No, no.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.340
 - You know what I mean?

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.980
 LXR has that like, ali-est sound to it.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.700
 It's kind of bit crunchy.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.300
 That's nice, that's part of the character of that machine.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.700
 But to get something that's being advertised is like,

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.580
 dark wave and dark techno and all this shit

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.860
 and then like hearing that, I'm like,

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.340
 I'm not hearing that.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.500
 I'd listen to the demo twice, 'cause like,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.300
 did I just miss something the first time through?

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.140
 And the second time I was like,

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:12.980
 I'm not feeling that.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.180
 I'm not, I would not spend the money on that.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.700
 You know, I don't know.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.380
 But then on the other side of the coin,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.420
 I listened to the demo of the Erika sense

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.340
 and their drum modules.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.460
 And they also specifically, you know,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.500
 are catering to a specific genre, I guess you could say.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.340
 You know what I mean?

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:36.340
 In every video, they said, you know, industrial techno.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.100
 And I'm like, okay, when you drop that fucking name,

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.940
 I'm gonna have a specific sound and standard

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.820
 that it gotta meet.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.460
 And I listened to that video and I said, fuck yeah.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.500
 I said, that's nailing it, you know what I mean?

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.820
 Like these guys are nailing it.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.260
 And it's not just the drum since like they got the whole,

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.700
 the whole lineup, the whole system mapped out there.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.260
 They had the drum sampler, they revealed.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.140
 - That looked really cool. - Yeah.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.180
 Which I think is two sampler in one.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.060
 He says basically like an evolved expansion

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.460
 of the Pico drum technology.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.660
 You can adjust start and stop,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.180
 start and end points of the samples.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.220
 - And it has a screen, right?

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.060
 - Yes.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.300
 Yeah, that's a nice addition.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.820
 You can see the waveform and all that.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.300
 That is pretty cool.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.780
 The bass line module, which is,

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.940
 I think it had three different modes of like bass-osque.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.620
 Plus it has the acid box filter.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.700
 So it's like pretty acidic, three or three-ish.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.220
 Which is kind of cool.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.620
 The entire lineup of like a 909 inspired system,

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.620
 kick, tom, symbol, hat, saw that jazz snare.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.740
 And then they had the dual channel distortion.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.580
 - Yeah.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.740
 - Which looks pretty killer.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.380
 Three different modes on there.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.220
 - Even by itself, it seemed like a great module.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.060
 - Yeah.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.220
 - That was the one where everything was coming through

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.940
 and he turned that on and just,

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.180
 everything just changed.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.020
 - Yeah.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.540
 - It sounded fantastic.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.420
 - Yeah, I guess you could run that in parallel

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.260
 or series or stereo if you wanted,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.340
 you know, it's pretty compact and seemed,

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.260
 sounded great and it's pretty versatile

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.820
 for a distortion module.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.860
 And then the mixer itself also has a built-in compressor.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.340
 It's seven channel mixer, like real compact

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.300
 and it's got onboard compressor.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.180
 So you could further slam and distort, I guess,

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.620
 if you wanted to take it in that direction.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.740
 And then the two channel effects.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.060
 It looked like similar to the dual channel distortion,

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.900
 you know what I mean?

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.900
 You've run it the same way in parallel or series

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.740
 or whatever and it's got, I guess,

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.340
 a selection of the algorithms from the black DSP.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.180
 - Oh, nice.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.020
 - Yeah.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.260
 So it's kind of like a,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.980
 like it would be a good accompaniment to the mixer,

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:58.820
 you know what I mean?

00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.660
 - Yeah.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.340
 - So it's cool, send them returns through that thing.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.140
 - Yeah, it's cool 'cause they've always had, you know,

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.300
 we've always seen them at knob con, like playing live,

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.980
 techno stuff on their modular.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.900
 So it was cool to see them kind of drive that idea

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.460
 a little further, you know?

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.020
 - Yeah, not just talk about their product

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.460
 but show it in action, you know?

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.780
 - Yeah. - Which is pretty cool.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.860
 - We kind of walked away from things,

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.340
 things that looked like shit a little early.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.860
 - Let's circle back.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.820
 - So I had another one.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.180
 - Let's go back, see if I don't know how.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.660
 - The Teenage Engineering OPZ.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.100
 - What does it do again?

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.180
 - It is apparently nothing but a hardware sequencer

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.540
 for an iPhone app.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.820
 - I totally missed that, I didn't even see that.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.940
 - That's the gray one, right?

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.620
 - It's the gray one. - No screen, no screen,

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.740
 and it's got, and you, it doesn't do anything until,

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.020
 it's is a beta, and this is them based on this video

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.380
 and I'm talking about it,

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.860
 but it only works with this iPhone app.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.980
 And like, it seemed like it's integrated pretty well,

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.860
 like they pressed a little button,

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.180
 and then the screen on the iPhone app,

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.500
 like said like filter sweep,

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.060
 and there was some sort of traffic indication.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.060
 It was cute, and they were emphasizing

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.900
 that it was a sequencer, I'm like,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.900
 "Why would you need this dedicated thing

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.180
 "to sequence a fucking app?"

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.380
 It just seemed like a huge fucking misfire

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.380
 compared to like the OP1, which,

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.980
 - If you don't understand, it's usefulness Dave.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.140
 - Yeah, then it's obviously not for you.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.660
 - It's above me. - Yeah.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.500
 - Like most things are.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.340
 - You just don't get it.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.460
 - Yeah, no, I'm wallowing in the dirt.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.700
 I was blown away, I was like,

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.300
 I mean, they've made other interesting things.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.780
 This just seems insanely fucking stupid.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.700
 Like the whole thing could just be surfaced in the app

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.380
 and then you don't have to spend,

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.540
 but I'm sure it's going to be a lot of money.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.380
 'Cause there's shit's not,

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.660
 except for the Baccot operators,

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.900
 shit's not cheap. - No.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.700
 - They've been working on it for years too.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.340
 - I remember like every name everyone's hoping

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.180
 they're gonna be some word about it.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.380
 - Yeah, this is at least three or four years.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.220
 - Wow.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.940
 - Yeah, if that's the result of it, that's shocking.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.100
 - Yeah, I thought it was like a video

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.540
 sent or something, shit like that.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.500
 - That's something else that I think they've still

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.460
 haven't announced that they've been working on forever.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.980
 It's the video thing that's been rumored forever.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.300
 - I had the OP1, 48 hours.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.060
 - Did you really? - Yeah, 48 hours.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.820
 And I was like, nope, right back on eBay.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.340
 - So what didn't you like about the OP1?

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.460
 - The sync stuff, like it wouldn't sync

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.980
 unless you got the fancy sync box

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.620
 that you couldn't buy at all.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.940
 So I was immediately like, all right,

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.740
 like can't do anything with it.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.740
 I don't know why I got it in the first place.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.780
 But then I tried it and was like,

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.060
 let's see what I can get out of it and didn't get.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.940
 I don't know, it just seemed like I was fighting

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.980
 through this novel interface to try to make music.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.300
 Instead of like, oh, this cool little video game

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.540
 helps me make a song or something like that.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.220
 It was, I don't know, it's not what I'm trying to do.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.900
 I just stumbled upon one of my other notes

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.020
 while we're talking about stuff to shit on.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.460
 - Yes.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.980
 - The news EDSP.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.380
 - So wait, is that actually gonna be qualified

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.420
 as a news EDSP or is it just a new fucking panel?

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.260
 - Nope.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.100
 - What's different about it?

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.060
 - It's considered Mark II.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.180
 What's different about it?

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.460
 More headroom for the feedback path.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.300
 - Are you fucking kidding?

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.140
 - No.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.140
 (laughing)

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.140
 - It's a very ugly panel.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.420
 - I mean, I get it they're going with,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.300
 they've got some sort of idea

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.660
 that that's their new aesthetic and it looks like shit.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.740
 Okay fine, you got a new panel.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.740
 - Oh wow, that looks bad.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.540
 That looks like shit.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.900
 They've really jumped the shark.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.100
 - You look at it and it's the exact same parameters.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.020
 It's the exact same novel.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.020
 - It's the exact same model,

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:47.340
 but they said they've redone the hardware behind it

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.980
 and they said it's a little better quality

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:53.340
 and more, I think it's 10 decibels less

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.620
 before it like clips out on the feedback channels.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:03.500
 So if you had a problem, turning the knob,

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.660
 turning the game down, problem solved now.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.260
 - Yeah.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.780
 - Were they gonna do the mini though?

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.940
 That was the thing, right?

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.780
 - They've never confirmed that.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.020
 Everyone has been wanting one forever

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.940
 and that's what everyone thought this meant.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.780
 - Yeah.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:19.940
 - It was right before Super Booth, they announced

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:24.940
 that ZDSP is now end of life, this version.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.220
 And everyone was like, oh sweet,

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.100
 can't wait to see what they announced at Super Booth

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.260
 and then that's what they dropped on us.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.660
 - Nah, like us already owning one.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.780
 It has a place in our system,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.540
 but if you're building a system

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.660
 and you want a DSP effects module,

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.300
 what are you gonna pick at that point?

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.420
 Are you gonna get the new ugly ZDSP

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.900
 or are you gonna get the black hole DSP2

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.300
 or the couple Pico DSPs?

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.820
 - Yeah, like there's other options now, you know?

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.940
 - That new aesthetic just looks bad.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.340
 - It looks like a pickle.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.600
 (laughing)

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:06.220
 - Noise engineering, the memetic digitalis.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.060
 - Yeah.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.900
 - Yes.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.060
 - Now available and shipping.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.820
 - I've got one one pre-order.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.860
 There's not shipped yet.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.860
 - Do we wanna explain to our listeners what it is?

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.260
 - It looks like a smaller voltage block to me,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.380
 like something where you can do parameter locky

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.500
 kind of recording, but you can also step through

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.020
 any of those steps on like this little four by four grid

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.340
 you get, edit those notes, but also do

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.340
 randomization of any pitch on the scale

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.860
 or randomization within one octave,

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.580
 which is a pretty cool feature.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.420
 - That is cool.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.220
 - They said they built it mainly just for live use,

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.860
 like it was multiple years of like,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.860
 we wanna build a little live sequencer

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.700
 and I was like, cool, that's kind of what I'm looking for.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.020
 A lot of quick ability to record pitch sequence

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.860
 and CV to send to stuff.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.100
 So, hoping it can fill the bill there.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.940
 But it's again, there's no way to get sequences back out,

00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:59.820
 which is fine.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:05.060
 And it's like 16 banks of four CVs that are pitched.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.380
 That's kind of what you have to work with.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.540
 - I did see you have like an undo function on there,

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.380
 which is cool though.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.220
 - Yeah, there's no way to--

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.060
 - There's no way to--

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.060
 - Miles patterns out, but like if you have a pattern set

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.380
 and you're tweaking it live and you wanna go right back

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.700
 to where you were, that's pretty cool.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.380
 - Yeah, and you can dupe 'em pretty easy in there too,

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.660
 which is nice.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.180
 Seems you can make variations pretty quick.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.220
 - Did I also see something about them doing reason plugins?

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.740
 What?

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.700
 - How did that come about?

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.540
 They want to know?

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.140
 - That was another surprise where it looks like

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.060
 they're doing sound generating reason extensions,

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.540
 like variations of the little calic

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.420
 and the similar engines that do certain parts.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.540
 I'm sure it's using some of the exact same code

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.260
 because they probably had the ability to port it over,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.220
 but I didn't dig in much further than that.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.340
 So I don't have reason.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.180
 - So--

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.020
 - It's the same here.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:53.860
 - That's kind of where my interest stops,

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.820
 but that looked cool.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.740
 It sounded good when I heard the samples,

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.820
 but it's nice to see that they would kind of

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.340
 contribute something like that.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.220
 - And I didn't even realize that kind of contribution

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.500
 was still an active thing with reason.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.260
 'Cause I don't follow it at all.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.980
 I don't know what's going on with it.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.740
 - Yeah, reason now, not only do they have the,

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:17.740
 like third party rack stuff that you can buy separately

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.620
 and some are free, you know?

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.260
 They also have VST support type stuff now.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.340
 So they've really opened it up over the last couple years

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.300
 compared to what it was.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.140
 - It's about time.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.660
 You know, and so what they're always been asking for

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.740
 forever with reason.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.940
 Like, so yeah, that's kind of cool.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.060
 It's a type of thing that I would expect to see

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.220
 in like reactor.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.060
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.220
 - Like noise engineering reactor block or something.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.220
 - I've seen it in reason, like that's pretty cool.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.700
 It tempts me to want to get back in a reason, honestly.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.500
 You know what I mean?

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.260
 Like, that sounds cool.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.820
 - Well, speaking about programming then,

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.860
 there was that weird core prologue programmer board.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.100
 - Oh yeah, what's up with that?

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.540
 - So apparently it was only available at Superbooth.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.020
 It was like an experiment.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.540
 And it's not gonna be readily available.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.740
 And it's just one single processor.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.980
 But it has all of the audio in and out

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.180
 and CV capability of just like one of the processors

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.420
 from the prologue.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.260
 And the idea is that somebody who was interested in

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.300
 writing code, you could go up to Superbooth

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.380
 and get one of these.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.420
 All the code is in C.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.460
 So it's pretty low level stuff as far as like programming.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:32.220
 But it was enough for you to write and see that, you know,

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.060
 your idea would work on one of these single processor.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.060
 And you're basically just confirming that your code

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:42.500
 would work on one of the however many the prologue has.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.740
 And yeah, it was just a way to start experimenting

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.980
 with programming for it.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.060
 - Well, it'd be really cool if they'd put like a graphical

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:51.900
 front end on it.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.780
 You could do like, no modular style, make like a single voice

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.740
 and like design patches or something.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:57.980
 - Yeah, that would be awesome.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.140
 That would be interesting.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.900
 (dramatic music)

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.660
 (dramatic music)

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:24.420
 - Do we wanna talk about that now?

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.740
 - Yeah, let's talk a little bit about it.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.980
 We just were, Scott was there at Superbooth

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.380
 from Industrial Music Electronics

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.700
 and AKA The Harvest Man,

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.260
 I see Will Forever Be in Our Hearts.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.100
 - Yeah.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.580
 - And it was like a 45 minute video.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.700
 I'm just talking about like piston, Honda Mark III.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.740
 - Wait, was that from Superbooth?

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.260
 Or was that the release party that was before Superbooth?

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.820
 - Oh fuck, that was the release party before it.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.660
 - Was it?

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.420
 - Yeah, and I think it was in Portland.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.980
 - Oh, my bad.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.020
 - But it was like a day, like two days before Superbooth.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:22:59.860
 So I think it counts.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.900
 - It kinda all blurred together in my head, but yeah.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.340
 Absolutely, I think you're right.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.300
 Well, regardless, let's lump it in

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.940
 with Superbooth announcements.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.620
 I think that's, 'cause yeah, it's shipping now.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.860
 It's out, like as of this weekend,

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.660
 like you can buy the piston Mark III.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.860
 I haven't pre-ordered one,

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.860
 but it's definitely on my like to get list

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.540
 into very near future.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.460
 And I was just playing a Nick how it doesn't have

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:31.020
 the LFO mode anymore, but it has two oscillators.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.380
 And we were just saying it would be cool

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.260
 if you could have had like the second oscillator

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.100
 in LFO mode or--

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.580
 - I was gonna say, does it go down to LFO rates?

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.060
 - I don't think it does.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.620
 And I was reading online, like,

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.980
 I can't remember if you mentioned in the video,

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.340
 but something about like the high fidelity-ness of it

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.700
 prevented him to be able to do that.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.420
 Like I guess you couldn't have both.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.660
 Like being able to go into LFO mode,

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.060
 I guess kind of jacked up the quality a bit.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.100
 In fact, it's not there anymore,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.220
 like it is on the Mark II.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.060
 - Right, right.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.660
 - But there are a lot of more interesting features

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:04.900
 that you put in there.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.860
 Like the presets saving, the preset morphing.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.980
 - The preset morphing is, I got a little jealous

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:14.300
 'cause that's something I really wish the graphic VCO had.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.380
 And it doesn't, and I hope--

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.220
 - Not yet, at least.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.700
 - I assume that's gonna be there eventually,

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.700
 but I have to, I was like,

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.860
 "Ah, that has to write out the gate."

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.700
 Yeah, it would just--

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.820
 - Apparently you can tweak,

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.260
 like exactly what you want it to randomize,

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.340
 and you can have like per gate triggered randomization

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.580
 and unison mode on both oscillators,

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.420
 where you can have like,

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.100
 I guess it's up to four copies of like, to detune.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:38.940
 - Oh, absolutely.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.300
 - So you can kind of get into like 352 territory

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.140
 where you're kind of making a cloud at that point,

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.700
 you know what I mean, of the waveforms,

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:51.060
 which is something I like a lot of the 352.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.780
 So it'll be cool to be able to get into that type of stuff.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.660
 And the weirdo piston realm, you know.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.260
 Still has the processing mode, which is pretty cool.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.580
 Just seeing the capabilities of the piston mark three

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.660
 makes me even more excited for the BFF at this point.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.500
 You know what I mean?

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.940
 'Cause I'm sure it's gonna be similar,

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.020
 it's gonna be a synth designed around the piston basically.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.860
 You know what I mean?

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.820
 - That's so dope for, yeah.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.180
 - Paul's gonna hate me.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.660
 That's a little bit 352.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.140
 - Wait, what did he call you?

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.420
 It's like a shithead or something?

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.020
 - Who was it?

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.020
 - I forget. - Oh, what the fuck was that?

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:29.300
 - But I felt very honored to be called a name from Paul.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.140
 - Paul, if you're listening.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:32.980
 What did you call it right?

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.820
 - Was it a dunderhead or something like that?

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:35.660
 - Yeah, it was not.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.620
 - It was something like old time.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.500
 - It was not a recent insult.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:44.980
 What else was there on everyone's lists?

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.180
 - The XAOC thing, do you know they want you

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.340
 to pronounce that as chaos and that kind of bugs.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.340
 - Really?

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.420
 - I know, right?

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.940
 - I pronounce it ZAOC.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.940
 - Yeah, like ZAOC.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.780
 - ZAOC.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.700
 - Nio before ZAOC.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.980
 - See, you think that's a real bummer

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.260
 'cause I'm really excited about the Zadar

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.460
 which I was already a little on the fence about calling it that.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.420
 They hear them so so they call this chaos.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.260
 - ZAOC.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.420
 - I'm not calling it that.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.540
 But the Zadar is, that looks awesome.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.940
 - Zadar looks, yeah, looks fucking dope.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.540
 - So I was really fired up for it

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.660
 because I'm finally at long last getting rid of my double

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.500
 andor.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.260
 (gasps)

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.580
 Yeah, gasps.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.180
 With the paint noise chip.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.500
 So I've been on the lookout for like another digital envelope

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.100
 generator and this one looks kind of bonkers.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.300
 So it's a four channel, 200 different digital envelopes.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.420
 And then there's tons of ways like morph those,

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.460
 you can flip it.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.540
 - You can like bend them right?

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.900
 - That's real appealing.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.180
 - Yeah, I remember them saying that you can't write your own,

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.020
 like you can with the Omni mod.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.900
 But it looks like there's enough flexibility there where,

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.940
 - You will not miss being able to draw it in.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.780
 - Right, right, yeah.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.260
 - And it was all kinds of different stuff.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.380
 It wasn't, I mean, it had like your basic ADSR, you know,

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.740
 linear, like it went from that to sort of like noise.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.300
 And the fact that it's four channel

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.500
 actually makes it even more appealing.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.500
 - Yeah.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.460
 - With assignable CV inputs,

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.660
 you can pick which parameter you want it to affect

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:18.780
 when just pretty cool.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.340
 - I think it kind of fills a gap.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.060
 I still think that there's like a gap with envelopes.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:24.900
 - Absolutely.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.060
 - Absolutely modular.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.980
 Overall, it's just people really haven't taken it to

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.260
 any interesting levels.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.220
 - I mean, especially like with digital envelopes.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.300
 I mean, when I was, when I was like,

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.500
 okay, I'm gonna get rid of the double hand

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.460
 or what else is out there.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.420
 And it was a handful of things.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.260
 - Yeah, it was nothing.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.100
 - Now envelopes.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.420
 - Envelopes.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.260
 - Fuckin' millions.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.100
 - Diamond doesn't.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.100
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.940
 - I think it would make a nice substitute for those

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.580
 who didn't want to get involved with the Omnimod mess also.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:51.420
 - Yeah.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.380
 - Personally, I still would like an Omnimod,

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.580
 but I just don't.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.860
 I don't trust it.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.860
 This looks like it does exactly what I was going to use

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.860
 an Omnimod for.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.700
 It began with, you know what I mean?

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.980
 Like, I don't give a shit about all the extra weird features

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.820
 that he was putting in there.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.660
 You know what I mean?

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.220
 Like, I just wanted a very versatile digital envelope

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.020
 wave shape based, you know what I mean?

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.140
 That you can mutate in interesting ways.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.340
 And it seems like that's exactly what this is.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.100
 (dramatic music)

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:40.980
 - How about you, Dave?

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.940
 (laughing)

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.940
 All I have is the graphic VCO from Erica Sintz.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.220
 We were playing with it earlier

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.900
 before we started recording.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.660
 I'm stoked on everything so far.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.020
 And it looks like we're even going to be adding new stuff

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.940
 on top of that.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.060
 It's a digital wave table oscillator

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.660
 and it's got a bunch of different modes.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:07.540
 One is AB, where you morph between two wave shape.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.620
 The other one is a single wave table

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.660
 and you sort of morph it.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.980
 And the last is this matrix where you set the boundaries

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.540
 and it goes through all of the wave tables in it

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.340
 and the X and Y controls,

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.700
 the sort of shifting between the wave tables.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.900
 And so there's different effects you can apply.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.060
 Like FM, Overdrive, Crush.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.860
 There's a huge list of them.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.660
 And then the different snapshots.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.700
 So as you save a setting,

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.500
 then there's a bank of these snapshots

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.060
 and then you can just go through

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.940
 and pick those as you need to.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.740
 Like Greg was asking,

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.900
 it would be cool if there was a way to cycle through

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.780
 the snapshots you've created.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.060
 But as of yet, there isn't.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.500
 - Be cool if you could morph between them.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.140
 - Yeah. - That would be awesome.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.980
 - That would be crazy.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.420
 - Yeah, more finger, just sequencing.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.500
 - Just sequencing between them.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.580
 - Just selection.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.980
 - Yeah, right now you've got to like go into that menu,

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.300
 hit and select it and then open that menu again

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.220
 and go back to it.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.300
 But like I said, it looks like they're adding new stuff to it.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.780
 There's like a like coming soon type

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.540
 of like little boxes.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.540
 So it doesn't seem like they're done with it quite yet.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.780
 But what's theirs already amazing?

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.980
 - Fuck how it sounds dude.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.260
 That thing looks fantastic.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.100
 - Yeah.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.700
 - That panel, the little stars and the comet.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.540
 - Yeah.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:29.540
 - And the, I love the black intelligel, knobs and caps.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.620
 That's what I've done my whole system with.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.420
 So props to them for good knob choice right there.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.260
 - It's aesthetically very pleasing.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.620
 And there's in a oscilloscope that if you're so inclined

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.620
 you can just sit and stare at for hours.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.980
 Everything visually about it is also.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.380
 - I mean it is a graphic PCOS.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.220
 - It should have graphics.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.660
 - It's gotta be eye catching.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.780
 - Yeah.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.340
 - They did a good job there.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.340
 - Yeah.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.740
 Is there anything I'm forgetting?

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.740
 - The sub oscillator.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.580
 - Oh the sub oscillator.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.420
 - That was pretty.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.260
 - Yeah. - That was a nice touch.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.780
 - It is a nice touch because there's two outs.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.980
 The first out is without the sub oscillator

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.860
 in the second one you can then mix.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.740
 How much of the sub oscillator in the original signal

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.500
 comes out of that and you can go all the way down

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.660
 to just the sub oscillator but all the way back up

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.260
 to just without it.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.540
 And there's a bunch of choices for the sub oscillator

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.900
 like how much it's detuned.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:30.980
 And also which wave shape the sub oscillator is going to be.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.220
 And you got a couple of basic ones.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:40.340
 Triangle, sine wave, square wave, what you would expect.

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.460
 But also it can be one of the wave tables.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.540
 Just you can just choose one of the wave tables

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.180
 or it can actually just be a copy of the original signal

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.100
 and then it's just detuned.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.740
 - It's kinda like the, like we were saying earlier,

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.420
 like a better version of the orgyrown accumulator

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.860
 in a lot of ways.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:58.700
 - Yeah.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.540
 - I like that module.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.540
 We both have them.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.740
 It always frustrated me that the tuning range

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.900
 was so limited.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.220
 You know, it's kinda like,

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.100
 I think the reason we're getting some of these things

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.060
 is 'cause they're like frustrations

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.900
 with some of these earlier modules that people have like said,

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.140
 oh, this is a problem like and fixed it

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.940
 whether it's their company or not.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.100
 - Again, before we started recording,

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.340
 we were talking about, I had a Pittsburgh generator

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.020
 for a really long time and I really loved it.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.740
 And then the noise engineering,

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.500
 Lukelek replaced that for me.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.860
 It just does all of that and then a million times more.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.860
 Like it's that, like cranked up.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:36.260
 And the same thing with the graphic VCO is the Orgon cranked up.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.060
 It's, you know, it's addressing all of its deficiencies.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.700
 It does everything that I loved,

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.140
 that module does and more evolving.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:44.980
 Evolving this.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.020
 - Yeah, it's got a nice, you know, visual display

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.780
 for everything that you do on it.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.620
 That's pretty cool.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.860
 - And you're only about one step or move from everything.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.220
 There's a sort of main menu with eight selection.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.300
 Then you can go through that really quickly

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.060
 and then you just go to one other screen.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.940
 It is not a huge dive.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.580
 - Yeah, it's not like a shape shifter,

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.340
 which is kind of like the opposite.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.180
 - Yeah.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.020
 - That seems like really menu driven.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.540
 This seems like they did a really good job

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.220
 with the UX on it.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.300
 - Yeah, totally great.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.460
 And I mean, there's a dedicated back button

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.300
 for every one of them.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.180
 So you're going in, you hit the back button.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.780
 - That is what the shape shifter needed.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.620
 - Yeah.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.980
 Just a simple back button.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.580
 It would have helped a lot.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.340
 I've played with pretty much every wave table loss

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.900
 that I've been able to get my hands on.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.740
 You know what I mean?

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.260
 And it reminds me of a weird combination

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:42.300
 of like Oregon cycle box and piston Honda.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.140
 You know what I mean?

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.380
 It's like the XY that you can do on there and everything.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.220
 It's pretty slick.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:51.420
 - As of right now, I haven't made my own wave tables.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.020
 You know, basically, I only got this like a week ago.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:54.860
 So I'm still in like--

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:55.860
 - What the fuck, dude?

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.380
 - Once again, I have failed.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.060
 But even with just like the stuff that it comes with,

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.900
 crazy ass sounds.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.860
 - Oh, so you just like presets now?

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.020
 - I love presets now.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.460
 (laughing)

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.780
 - You haven't hand drawn every wave manually.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.860
 - I did play with me.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.860
 - It's just sketch mode.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.380
 - It is straight up at the sketch.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.820
 Maybe with a little bit of practice,

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.740
 I'd be able to do it faster,

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.420
 but my first experiments was drawing it.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.540
 Drawing a wave shape was a little growing.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.860
 And I love tedious tasks.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.900
 And even I was crying.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.780
 (laughing)

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.060
 - We saw that video with them recently.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.340
 - Oh, yeah, the aircocents.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.420
 It was a very nicely shot,

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.540
 like them explaining where they are in Latvia,

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.900
 like the city that they're in.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:51.380
 And their weird basement podcast thing.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.100
 - Yeah, that looks pretty cool.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.860
 I didn't know that they were doing that

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.140
 until I saw the video and I was like,

00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:58.700
 "Oh, I'll check that out."

00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.540
 - Yeah, seriously.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.340
 - I would hang out with those people.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.420
 - Yeah, I remember seeing the dude with the Nohawk,

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.420
 like demo and stuff.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.100
 I think that was at knob con or something.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:07.940
 - Yeah, yeah. - Or something,

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.580
 I can't remember, but I was like,

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.580
 "Yeah, these guys look cool."

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.540
 And then like all the stuff they even put out lately,

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.580
 I just, it's like, "Okay, yeah, these guys get it."

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.420
 - Yeah.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:19.000
 (loud music)

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.580
 (loud music)

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:38.400
 - Also a Geiger counter.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.280
 - I loved the little, you know, format of the box,

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:47.000
 but yeah, the yellow red color scheme is such an eyesore.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.080
 And I didn't, I was one of the first orders apparently

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.760
 to ship out and I didn't know it at the time,

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.000
 but there was a limited run,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.040
 very limited run of like a gray box.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.520
 Dark gray, yeah, and I was like, "Son of a bitch."

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.080
 And by the time I found out,

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.800
 it was too late for me to like change my order

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.360
 and they were already sold out.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.360
 - That's awesome. - Yeah, that's awesome.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.720
 - That was really bummed.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.120
 I was like, I would have really enjoyed the limited edition,

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.000
 but yeah.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.640
 - I just hate the color yellow.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.000
 - Yeah, I'm not a fan.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.080
 - And it's like a Pittsburgh color,

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.240
 so it's like everywhere in this fucking city.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.240
 - This also, that makes it look like Metasonics.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.000
 - Yeah, we can rather like radioactive green or something.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.840
 - Yeah.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.120
 - You know, like one of the yellow,

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.440
 which I always think of like Metasonics

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.600
 or like fucking traffic sign, you know, like road signs.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.040
 I don't know why.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:38.880
 - Or McDonald's.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.720
 - Or McDonald's.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.640
 - Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to stimulate appetite

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.480
 or just like the hunger.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.480
 - The colors in McDonald's were chosen for a reason.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.320
 - The hunger.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.960
 - It gives you hunger.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.320
 - Catch up mustard colors.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.160
 - Yeah.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.880
 - Condiments.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.440
 - I don't know. - I love condiments.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.680
 - Yeah, I'm gonna hunger now.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.600
 - We could all eat this pedal.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.440
 - Okay.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.240
 - There's probably almost no nutritional value.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.880
 And I'm just gonna break my teeth.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.440
 - Well, it is full of sonic goodness.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.680
 - Jesus.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.080
 - Oh, if you break your teeth, we can drink the blood.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.640
 (laughing)

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.800
 - Now I do love the box.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.280
 It's pretty large improvement

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.120
 over the original Geiger counters.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.440
 It's been a long time coming this version, you know what I mean?

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.000
 It's been rumored and hyped up for a few years now,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.040
 but I suppose it was worth the wait.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.520
 It's got a bunch of new shit.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.800
 And just the quality overall,

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.720
 I feel like the sound quality is pretty nice.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.320
 It goes higher up, it's not just eight bit anymore.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:45.360
 You got a higher sample rate, higher bit rate.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.560
 And just the wave bank itself is much larger.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.160
 I don't know if they did,

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.440
 but it sounds like they did make improvements

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.400
 over the preamp.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.240
 It just sounds a little cleaner.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.560
 And it reminds me of the same preamp

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.440
 that's in the trash masters.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.640
 You know, and it's got a nice balance with all of it.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.600
 'Cause you have your white dry,

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.600
 the level of the preset,

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.160
 and then the master volume.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.800
 So you can get a nice balance with everything in there.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.760
 You can CV the tone now.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.920
 Yeah, what you couldn't do before.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.400
 That was something I actually emailed WMD

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.040
 when I first bought the module like years back.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.440
 I said, I love tweaking this tone of on the modules.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.600
 Is there any way to CV the gain and tone?

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.880
 You said at the time it wasn't possible.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.400
 Now it is on this boat.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.520
 So that's pretty sweet.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.520
 You can CV both, gain and tone, all that.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:51.520
 You get two assignable CV inputs, which is pretty cool.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.520
 I mean, I would rather this was a module,

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.600
 but the fact that it's not,

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.440
 and you can still CV it is pretty cool.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.720
 So what are all the other knobs on this?

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.680
 There isn't really any new knobs,

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.160
 aside from the master and the level and stuff like that.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.600
 But you can save presets now, which is nice.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.440
 Oh, that is cool.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.120
 You can also, there's a rand button.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.480
 You can just randomize a preset,

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.000
 find something you'd like, save it.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.120
 You don't even really need to touch the knobs

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:20.960
 if you don't want to.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.880
 You know what I mean?

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.920
 Like if you had a preset and you wanted to load another one,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.360
 is it smooth or is it like cut out?

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.200
 It's real smooth.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.200
 Okay, cool.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.160
 Got it preset, oh preset down.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.080
 Knobs here.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.960
 So I mean, it's still, you know,

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.400
 stomp pedal format.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.320
 Yeah.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.800
 So if this was a module,

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.560
 I think it would be nice to have CV control

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.160
 over that randomized function.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.440
 And the presets, you know what I mean?

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.920
 So you could have a bunch saved,

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.200
 and then CV sweep through them or sequence them or whatever.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.000
 Maybe hit the random function with a gate

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.480
 to just generate some new chaos.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.720
 Is random everything random?

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.560
 I believe so.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.400
 Okay.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.160
 I'm limited to a certain things.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.720
 Ehh, it might be.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.160
 Like I don't think it'll,

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.800
 I don't know if it would hit the gain in tone.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.920
 That's a very good question.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.760
 Or the wet and dry,

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.440
 because that would be kind of, oh yeah it does.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.680
 It definitely hits everything.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.560
 'Cause you could see the LED indicators

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.560
 for the tone change and the wet dry change, so yeah.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.400
 We could probably insert a sample right here.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.520
 Insert sample here.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.360
 Yeah.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.120
 (engine revving)

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.880
 (engine revving)

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:52.440
 And while we're talking about the 301,

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.720
 you said there's a new firmware, you just saw recently?

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.360
 - Yeah, so he just got.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.680
 Yeah, it's got, so there are new sample types

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.200
 where there's like a clocked player

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.360
 that will time stretch.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.920
 And it'll even respect the slices that you have set up

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.240
 and it'll time stretch those individually

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.360
 when you send it like a group of slices.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.400
 So you can play that stuff just in at a clock

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.120
 and it'll like able to in style be like,

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.160
 okay, this is how long you wanted me to play it, right?

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.440
 And then there's also the one that does not,

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.640
 that will affect the pitch only.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.000
 So you can send like a loop in it,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.840
 it'll actually re-pitch it

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.760
 so you don't get the time stretching effect.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.760
 He put another bunch of stuff in here,

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.040
 but man, it's crazy how much he's adding to this platform.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.400
 - The Digitag doesn't do any of that.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.560
 - No looping.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.360
 And with the pedal loopers now, you can record like

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.240
 perfect loops, put them in a buffer,

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.240
 load them into that clock time stretch thing.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.600
 And it's just what you would expect it to be.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.440
 - It's interesting.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.280
 - It's nuts that he keeps like,

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.520
 it's just honestly, I've had problems right now with Squarp

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.720
 because my pyramid touch pads lifting,

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.760
 they've delayed their release for the fourth month now.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.760
 - I don't buy it, man.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.760
 This is a one man shop running the 301,

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.760
 building them all, supporting it all.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.760
 Somehow he has a clear roadmap,

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.760
 some tile people know when the next units will be available,

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.760
 he never misses his dates.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.760
 He just told everybody on the forum,

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.760
 he's like, "I'm going on a bike trip for a month.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.760
 "Don't bother calling me or like emailing me."

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.760
 He's like, "Cool, have fun, man."

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.760
 I'm not gonna be expecting anything from you.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.760
 Whereas if you keep pushing a release,

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.760
 like electron and Squarp,

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.760
 it's like, "Eh, why am I fucking with you?"

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.760
 Shit doesn't work.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.760
 - He added slicing stuff,

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.760
 oh, he finally added like, sesteing loops.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.760
 So if you hold down, it'll play the sample,

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.760
 and then you define a loop,

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.760
 and then it'll loop through that part of it

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.760
 until you let it go.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.760
 - Which actually the bitbox added,

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.760
 and that was even more flexible.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.760
 - Yeah, it was even more flexible.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.760
 - The bitbox, they really took that to the next level.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.760
 But the slicing, like the spectral slicing,

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.760
 I was like, "Why would you want that?"

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.760
 And I'm like, "Oh, he had field recordings."

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.760
 Like, slices on spectral energy instead of thresholds.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.760
 So you can have a noisy ass mic,

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.760
 and it won't matter until you get to like,

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.760
 whatever you're going for,

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.760
 then it will slice it there.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.760
 I'm like, "Man, you're fucking smart."

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.760
 Yeah, there are lots of cool granular stuff he's added.

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.760
 Like the stretch one is actually a granular clock stretch too.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.760
 So you have some granular controls over it.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.760
 There's different noise types.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.760
 Like you can take a,

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.760
 there's a velvet noise in there,

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.760
 which I'd never heard of before.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.760
 - Yeah, right?

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.760
 - I've never heard of that.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.760
 - But you can take that and you can pitch it down real far

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.760
 and assign it to like slices.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.760
 Like I think that MLOGRADER is doing,

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.760
 it's like true randomization.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.760
 But you can control that too.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.760
 So you can have like only an amount of that randomization

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.760
 offset and attenuated to the range you're going for.

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.760
 Yeah, and then you can have that point it to slices.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.760
 Like, it's crazy.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.760
 I think I told you guys this too.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.760
 You can take like a whole folder of samples,

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.760
 be like, "Load this up and make it into a sliced up thing."

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.760
 And it'll be like, "Doop, just take the starts and ends,

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.760
 put the slice there so you can have all that stuff just on one

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.760
 channel and then scan through it with CCs."

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.760
 - Wow.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.760
 - Or CVs.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.760
 - CCs pizza?

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.760
 - Yes.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.760
 - Oh, you can eat?

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:07.760
 - CC DeVille from Poison.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.760
 - Mm-hmm.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.760
 (upbeat music)

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.760
 (upbeat music)

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.760
 (upbeat music)

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.760
 (upbeat music)

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.760
 (upbeat music)

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.760
 (upbeat music)

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.760
 (upbeat music)

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.760
 (upbeat music)

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.760
 (upbeat music)

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.340
 (upbeat music)
