00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:26.640
 - Good morning, Vietnam!

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.680
 (groans)

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.520
 - Ah.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.240
 - What's everyone drinking?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.840
 - Oh, I have a boring lime perrier.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.560
 - It's not as boring as mine.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.920
 Water.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.640
 - Okay, yeah.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.400
 - Yeah, that's what I had last time.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.720
 - I've got an ice coffee and a pop made from a soda stream.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.240
 - You're drinking an iced coffee at night?

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.240
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.240
 - I think drink coffee, go to sleep.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.240
 - Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 - Yeah.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.240
 - Did you carbonate your ice coffee?

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.240
 - I didn't.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 My partner was, I mean, as soon as we got this thing,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.240
 I wanted to start just carbonating everything.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 - Right.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.240
 - And to her credit, she was much more of an adult than me.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 It was like, let's just stick to water for now until we get used to it.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.240
 I'm like, "Oh, look at all these liquids that are not carbonated.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.240
 This is bullshit."

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.240
 - Well, the trick I've discovered is to, and I haven't had one in a while though,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.240
 but when I did, I wanted to carbonate everything as well.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 It was working with some juices and things like that,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.240
 but it was just kind of making it nasty in others.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 The trick is to not carbonate the juice.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 You got to kind of water things down with your carbonation.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 If you want a carbonated orange drink, like I did,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 I would make some fresh squeeze, O.J.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 and then I would water it down with carbonated water from the soda stream.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.240
 It was a lot better than trying to actually water down the O.J.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.240
 and then carbonate that.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 For some reason, it was not working out as well.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240
 - Makes sense.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.240
 - Plus, I mean, you're just going to gum up the works.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.240
 That was the thing that I was worried about.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.240
 A legitimate concern was that it was not designed for anything other than water,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.240
 so fucking knock it off.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.240
 Well, I will try that. Thank you.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.240
 I didn't do that for this though.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.240
 These are separate beverages.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.240
 - Is somebody typing?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.240
 - I had to get my list. I'm sorry.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.240
 I'll be done in one second. I'm just going to the list.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.240
 - No.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.240
 - Unprofessional.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.240
 - You're going to print it in the sound?

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.240
 - Fuck now.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.240
 There it is.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.240
 - All right, I'm good.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.240
 - Yeah, my work was kind of busy.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.240
 - I was at only had time to really shot up some notes about the noise engineering thing.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.240
 I don't know if I'm going to be able to dip into the reminder.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.240
 Unfortunate.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.240
 - Oh, yeah.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.240
 - I kind of want to know about that, but I understand if you don't want to go into it.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.240
 I was looking at that the other day, and, uh, yeah.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.240
 Let's not talk about it though.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.240
 [laughter]

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.240
 - We're just going to edit this out, or is it just going to be this like weird tease?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.240
 - Weird tease.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.240
 - Here's something we could have talked about.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.240
 We can just list all kinds of things that we could talk about, and then just not.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.240
 - Stay tuned and find out if we actually talk about it.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.240
 [laughter]

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.240
 - That's for our patreon's.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.240
 - Yes, exactly.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.240
 - You back for the patreon we don't have.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.840
 - If you've backed us, uh, actually then in the patreon you go there, it's just us listing

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.240
 more things we could talk about.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.240
 - If you really want the juicy stuff, add me on snap.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240
 - Oh.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:55.240
 - Also, I like that people, um, listen to this with no context of what the fuck we're talking

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.240
 about, and I don't know how they process it, but that happens.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.240
 So, hi people, that listen with no context of synthesizers.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.240
 - Fuck.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.240
 [laughter]

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.240
 - Oh, wait, we're talking about synthesizers?

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.240
 Fuck, I got the wrong notes.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.240
 - Yeah, wrong podcast.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.240
 [laughter]

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.240
 - This one's about laxatives.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.240
 - I thought we were talking about anime and weed.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.240
 - Okay.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.240
 I'm ripping up the fat vape pen right now.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.240
 [laughter]

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.240
 - Listeners.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.240
 - I think I spent most of the last episode talking about VR.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.240
 - There was some good content.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.240
 I can hate that word.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.240
 - It was good content.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.240
 [laughter]

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.240
 - Am I a content creator now?

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.240
 - Are you an influencer?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.240
 - Oh shit.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.240
 - Was anyone influenced to buy VR after that lengthy explanation?

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.240
 - I don't know.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240
 - Get us up.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.240
 Tweet us.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.240
 Tweet us friends.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.240
 - Add me on snap.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.240
 - I didn't want snap.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.240
 - You only have to kill one person to be a murderer, so if you influenced one person to buy VR shit,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 you're an influencer.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.240
 - Yeah.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.240
 - By definition.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.240
 - Yeah.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.240
 - Do you put VR shit on your snap?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.240
 Like weird shit?

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.240
 - I can.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.240
 - I'll call it.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.240
 - I'll request for anyone on my premium.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.240
 - I don't use snapchat, but I'd probably sign up for that.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.240
 [laughter]

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.240
 - It's just me with VR goggles on, flogging myself.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.240
 - You can't see what I'm seeing, but just use your imagination.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.240
 [laughter]

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.240
 - Oh shit.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.240
 - So the index though, that's popping off right.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.240
 Did we talk about that last time?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.240
 I can't.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.240
 - I didn't have it last time.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.240
 I just had my riff.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.240
 - So I thought.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.240
 - Yeah.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.240
 So I just spoiled it.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.240
 [laughter]

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.240
 I was going to dip back into it, but I suppose I can't.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.240
 I sold the riff that shifted out yesterday.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.240
 Got the index in.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.240
 Got the full finger tracking.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.240
 Hi, Rez.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.240
 - Wait, wait.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.240
 Slow down, slow down.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.240
 What is all of this stuff?

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.240
 - It's the future, Dave.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.240
 - Yes, but those of us who aren't in the future can at least give us a overview.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.240
 - It's the new VR headset and controllers from Valve.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.240
 - That's virtual reality.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.240
 - Virtual reality, yes.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.240
 Like Johnny Nemonic.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.240
 - Mm.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.240
 - Loma or a man?

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.240
 - A documentary.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.240
 - I continued on my movie spree as well.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.240
 - What'd you go to?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.240
 - Wait, wait, wait.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.240
 We just deviated from VR in our heard--

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.240
 - Well, I wasn't deviated.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.240
 - No, okay.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.240
 - It's VR-related movies.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.240
 Like I started watching, I watched "Existence."

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.240
 - I love that.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.240
 - I like that movie.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.240
 - Yeah.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.240
 - Holy shit, that's so good.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.240
 - I forgot how much I liked that movie.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.240
 - Yeah.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.240
 - Underrated.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240
 Highly underrated.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240
 - Very.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:05.240
 - Now, his son is making a movie also in the VR vein that--

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.240
 - Damn it.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.240
 - I can't remember the name of, but the trailer looks absolutely fantastic.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:18.240
 It looks like if you took "Existence" and "Video Jerome" and like they had a baby in 2020.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.240
 - Mm-hmm.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.240
 - This is like, yeah, it just looks insane.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.240
 I'm gonna have to Google that now.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.240
 Hold on.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.240
 Stand by.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.240
 - "Posesser."

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.240
 - Is the name.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.240
 - "Posesser."

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.240
 Is there a unnecessary Z in it?

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.240
 Like, existence?

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.240
 - Uh, no.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.240
 - Yeah.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.240
 - Yeah.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.240
 - Also, watch it.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:43.240
 - But fun fact, he had a big hand in the special effects of existence.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.240
 I didn't know that.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.240
 - Not a normal size hand.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.240
 - Just a huge hand.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.240
 Like in the Foo Fighters video, you know?

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.240
 - So fucking bad.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.240
 - Jesus Christ.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.240
 - I'm a child.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.240
 - You should slap a Z in there, though.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.240
 - There should be a Z.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.240
 So wait, what's the premise of this movie that he's making?

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.240
 - I don't know.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.240
 Some, like, the trailer is complete nonsense, but it looks awesome.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.240
 Like, it's just somebody, um, kind of, like, altered states-ish.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.240
 Like, it looks like they're doing some sort of experiment.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.240
 This woman's a volunteer.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.240
 She keeps strapping herself into, like, this hardcore VR get-up.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.240
 They're, like, injecting her with stuff and attaching this stuff to her face.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.240
 And she's, like, going into some virtual realm.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.240
 It just looks pretty, uh, pretty insane.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.240
 - Sweet.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.240
 - Fucking hate altered states, by the way.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.240
 - What?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240
 - What?

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240
 - That movie drives me fucking insane.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.240
 - What?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.240
 - Wow.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240
 - Okay, but here's the thing.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.240
 Like, I saw it as a kid, and, like, the first three quarters of it, I was like, I was fucking

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.240
 there.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.240
 I'm like, oh my God, this is literally the best thing I've ever seen in my fucking life.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.240
 And when he turned into the 8-bit, it just fucking was so disappointing, dude.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.240
 - He's going back to his primitive monkey brain.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.240
 - It just...

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.240
 - But did he turn into a monkey, or was he just having a bad trip?

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.240
 - See, that's the thing.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.240
 We don't, you know, it's kind of...

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240
 - It just kind of big.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240
 - I wanted it to...

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.240
 I wanted it to go into a psychedelic realm that it couldn't have gone into, maybe, at the

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.240
 time.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.640
 And the aspect, it was like peeking on a trip and then ending up just somewhere that wasn't

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640
 really...

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.240
 - Ended up in a subway bathroom.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.240
 - Yeah, I was going to say like a Dunkin' Donuts or something like that.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.240
 Yeah, like, some fucking hallucinatory fluorescent light pulsing away, just like...

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.240
 Maybe it was a pretty good movie.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.240
 Maybe that's why you were consulted about how that movie should end.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.240
 Alright, so we go to Dunkin' Donuts.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.240
 - Time to make the donuts.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.240
 - Actually, I don't think I've seen it in a pretty long time now.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.240
 - It's been a while.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.240
 - I'm gonna be sure you watch it.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.240
 - I used to love it.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.240
 But it's been amazing.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:09.240
 I sampled the living shit out of it over the years, but...

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.240
 - What parts in particular?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.240
 Like, what was a good sample?

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.240
 - I liked to sample a lot of the screams from it, especially towards the end when they're

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.240
 in there, that like psychedelic whirlpool.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.240
 And he's like mutating and screaming.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.240
 - I remember talking to you about this years ago.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.240
 - Yeah, I think 'cause you asked me what some of the samples I was using and some of the

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.240
 Prometheus stuff was.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.240
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.240
 - And we ended up discussing altered states.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.240
 - It's a fucking A, right?

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.240
 You know, let's kick it off.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.240
 - Yeah, I mean, I heard people have lists.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.240
 It was a list.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.240
 - I have 80 things, but I don't want to kick it off.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.240
 I'm feeling like that.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.240
 - Well, who is the longest list?

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.240
 They should go first.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.240
 - I got four things.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.240
 - I've got three things.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.240
 So, Nick, I think you should go first.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.240
 - First?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.240
 - Uh...

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.240
 - Bionic Cluster.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.240
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.240
 So I'll give my Bionic Cluster three review now that I have one.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.240
 'Cause you guys had one and I didn't bite on it a while ago.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.240
 And really wanted a stereo filter 'cause I was trying to do a stereo signal path in the

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.240
 modular.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.240
 I was like, "Okay, don't have quite the filter I want.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.240
 ER 301 can do filtering, but that is by far not at strong point.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.240
 Those filters don't sound like a Bionic Cluster or anything else, really.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.240
 They're cool, but not that cool.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.240
 Bionic Cluster three though, holy shit.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.240
 I did not realize that Scott modeled that somewhat after a Nordlead one, I guess, or a Nord--one

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.240
 of the Nord leads, maybe the three.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.240
 But man, the resonance is really fucking amazing.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.240
 The swept modes, and we've covered some of this before, but going into the comb and the

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.240
 resonance are probably my favorite things.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:12:00.640
 And just the overall--I feel like it's--like he's--it felt like the peak to me of some of

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.640
 his designs because it's so fucking easy to use and so flexible and it just seems like

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.640
 really solid.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.640
 And yeah, just huge props, really, really like it.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.640
 So glad I picked it for the stereo filter, even though it's digital.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.640
 Zero complaints really so far.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.640
 It's fucking tremendous.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.640
 I think the comb filter was definitely like my favorite aspect to it.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:29.640
 Although I never really used it in stereo, believe it or not.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.640
 It's kind of sending one channel to the other dual processing.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.880
 Now that you mention it, I was using it in the linked stereo, but that makes me want to

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.640
 try it in unlinked stereo to do some different parameters.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:49.640
 Some weird, like, binaural filter sweeping.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.640
 Yeah.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.640
 Yeah, like the presets and the way you can kind of morph through them.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.160
 I haven't played with it too much, but it's just pretty--it's nice to be able to recall

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.680
 that shit pretty quickly.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.680
 Definitely digging that.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.680
 Yeah.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.480
 So yeah, super good stereo filter that I use in mono and stereo a lot.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.080
 Definitely scratch the itch for sure.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.200
 Yeah, and the overdrive is nice too.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.560
 It definitely adds a nice color to some thinner digital things that I've been trying to beef

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.960
 up a little bit.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.120
 Yeah, and I like that it can be subtle.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.560
 Just put a little bit on it or you can really crank it and turn it to shit.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.560
 Yeah, add a little bit of that digital soft clipping crunch.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.560
 Yep.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.800
 Yeah, I definitely--I don't have it much past noon, I don't think.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.080
 But yeah, it's definitely--I've used it a lot for smooth shit.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:49.280
 The resonance is pretty nice in some ways, and it handles like disgusting things as well

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.000
 as smooth, just like bass sounds and stuff like that.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.240
 So definitely super into it.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.040
 I'm not into fucking 303s that don't work.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.880
 That's fucking not cool.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:07.880
 So I'll go into the acid saga quick because that was a quick review.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.440
 So yeah, fucking 303s.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.760
 I like to use them sometimes.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.600
 I was finishing up trying to finish up some material and I was reviewing some tracks and

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.400
 was just like, huh, there's like something missing.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.920
 And then one morning I just started to fucking got the TB3 out, which is still maybe my favorite

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.360
 acid box in a way, but that's the next thing.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.720
 But I just started to add some 303 lines to some tracks and immediately I posted something

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.440
 stupid on Instagram and immediately, like three people that I respect were just like,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.800
 fucking--fuckin' do this, like finish the shit.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.920
 And I was like, okay, I want to keep drilling into this a little bit.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.960
 And that made me want to have some competing 303 lines on tracks.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.320
 I wanted two things and I wanted one to be just different.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.640
 And the TB3, like the disgusting Ira one that I still kind of fucking love, that's green

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.080
 and weird, a few people remarked to me that it sounds like a VST quote unquote.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.880
 And I'm like, okay, I kind of hear what you're saying with that.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:08.440
 It's like not raw analog, but it's still like my favorite sequence at a program.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.160
 So at first I was like, okay, I'm going to get an XOX box.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:17.400
 And I took the risk of like a 300-some dollar XOX box on Reverb and got it and like screw

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.600
 immediately fell out of it.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.040
 It was making fucking ground loops and buzzes when I touched the panel, but it did run.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.320
 But then I started to notice it was like writing rests when I touched the panel.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.680
 And I was like, oh fuck, like this is--

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.680
 That's hilarious to me.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.080
 Yeah, it was--but the thing is like, I didn't have much recourse.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.040
 I bought it as is, you know, it wasn't even like shop policy.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.680
 I knew it was like, okay, this might be a thing, but it looks like it was modded to--it had

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.160
 another oscillator and all that shit worked, kind of, except from the rest and everything

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160
 like that.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.200
 But then I fucking made the mistake of taking that panel off.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.760
 And I, as I had to do to check it out and realized it was like definitely like the fucking

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.520
 shittiest drunk solder job I've ever seen.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.200
 Like, not even--I don't know.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.040
 Nobody gave a fuck about any of the solder joints.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.840
 I immediately wanted to reflow the whole thing and it was just like, okay.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.680
 I'm imagining like, you pull the panel off and it's just like a giant rat's nest of like

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.240
 cave pop and cockroach comes crawling out.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.280
 There's like a cigarette button there.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.760
 It was a little gross and like the nature of the modded XOX boxes, like it's fucking packed

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.760
 already.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:28.320
 Like, you've got a--even like, you know, Luke who like--he's a very high level like builder

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:36.160
 of things and mechanical and electrical and he had to get his like helped from Brian Casketer,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.640
 the XOX I/O guy, like just to fix like a mixer and something because it's that complicated

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.640
 and difficult.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.640
 So it's already kind of klugey.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.480
 This dude, it was like the tape was coming off the fucking flying wires.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.800
 It was just like an immediate mess.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.040
 I took it apart and some of the internal structure of it like the screw fell out and I was like,

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.560
 oh shit, I'm going to have to rebuild this thing like right now.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.720
 So I did and I screwed it back together and the fucking sequence I wouldn't even come

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.720
 on at all.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.680
 And it was just like, okay.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.320
 I like definitely almost rage broke it but I've been meditating every morning so I didn't,

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.320
 which was cool.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.920
 And it's just upstairs now in a fucking box.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.560
 Dude, that masking tape you peeled off.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.440
 That was a structural that actually was holding a lot of it up.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.960
 It has load bearing masking tape.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.200
 There was like, there was, I touched the back at one point and the hum went away and I was

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.000
 like, oh shit, okay, there's just like a ground wire that's fucked up here or something like

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 that.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 I've just got to find this and make a new ground.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.360
 So that was kind of my mission and then the fucking mission went awry and everything

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.960
 just fell to shit.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.960
 Is it salvageable?

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.960
 I mean, can you repair the server?

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.960
 Oh yeah.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.960
 I'm going to fucking fix it.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.400
 There's nothing in this that couldn't be redone.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.680
 I highly suspect that maybe an IC got fried because of a short or something like that.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.000
 I'm just going to check that out.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.120
 But I don't have the heart to get into that.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.720
 I wanted to start making fucking music and I wanted to continue doing that.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:01.680
 So the next stop was to, I borrowed Prezolob's TB03, which is the newer Roland clone.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.200
 And it sounds way better.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.320
 It sounds really good.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.920
 It's the first time I was like, okay, there's something that the TB3, the original is missing.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.920
 There are liquid territories it can't go to.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.680
 I like having the envelope modulation on just a regular fucking knob and the decay instead

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.520
 of the weird-ass touchpad and shit like that.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.120
 So yeah, I really like that.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:30.160
 But I was still like, okay, that's 400 bucks and I don't really want to do that right now.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.400
 And I was there at the studio to pick it up and Ruderman had the TD3, which is the parent

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.920
 your clone that just came out.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920
 He played it on the monitors.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.880
 I was like, okay, it sounds better than the XOX.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.800
 It's got some liquidness to it and the bass is really good.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.800
 It sounds alive.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.560
 Like as cheesy as that is, it sounds analog.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.760
 So it was like, okay, it got one for $130.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.920
 I compromised the bare thin ethics that I try to have getting this fucking baronge or

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.920
 piece of shit.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.080
 And it's like, I took it out of the box and it felt like it was going to float away.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080
 I remember.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.240
 It's just made of cardboard.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.960
 How can you make plastic that fucking thin?

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.160
 I know that I could crush it with my hands right now.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.160
 It's weird, right?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:19.360
 But also like, it's just as cartoon sounding as the fucking thing looks because the gate

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.280
 timing is all wrong, like the accent gate, which is a very particular 303 sound and you

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.840
 could hear right away, you're like, oh, that's like 100, 200 milliseconds too long.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.080
 It sounds fucking wrong.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.920
 It doesn't even pop the filter up right.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.080
 Oh, this has got like no snap to it.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.200
 No, it's just, it's got like a...

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.240
 ...pulse to it instead of a snap, you know?

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.800
 Immediately it was just like, oh, I want to turn the decay down on that gate.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.800
 I want to shorten that gate.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.800
 Yeah.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.000
 So it sounded different than the one Ruderman played for you.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.600
 I couldn't like...

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.160
 All I heard there was like, I heard the bass and I was like, fuck, that's like...

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.000
 You know, it turned the resonance.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.560
 I'll turn the bass and it didn't like, I wasn't there long because of COVID and shit like

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.480
 that and we were inside.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.920
 And I heard it and I was like, I'm going to try it.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.920
 But yeah, this one, like, I don't know.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.920
 And I know like, you could immediately get like, there's books of mods that people have

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.920
 made and the, you know, the accent gates are one of the complaints and you can change your

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.080
 resistor and do it.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.920
 But I didn't want to like, start to gut the thing when I got it.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:21.520
 So you can't do that like, clicky acid thing when you take everything to like the minimum?

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.520
 It kind of does, but it's just not as clicky as you'd want it to be.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.520
 Yeah.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.520
 But...

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.520
 That's kind of important.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.520
 ...one of three of three.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.520
 It is.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520
 It is.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.960
 It just doesn't, it doesn't sound.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.640
 It sounds like a different kind of synth that's trying to be a three or three in a way.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.120
 But I'm still like, I would never return it because it was just so cheap and it was

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.400
 just like, that would not be worth the time.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.280
 And I still think it can be used for music.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.880
 Like I still think it's different enough and that's why I like the tb3 is because it

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.880
 does sound not normal and not like the og.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.120
 It sounds like digital and I kind of, I want it to not.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.920
 I don't want to do the same shit.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.440
 So the difference is kind of a good thing.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:10.120
 But yeah, I think I do want to get the newer tb03 that's discontinued.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:15.240
 So I might actually, hey, if anybody wants to trade the TR09, the baby TR09, get me up.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.760
 I would trade straight up for that.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.760
 Damn, dude.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.160
 I wish I hung on to mine just a couple months longer.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.160
 I could trade you for you.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.160
 Yeah.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.960
 I would trade the TR09 right now, I think.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.840
 I was honestly considering when I sold mine to get the TR09 based on your high praise

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840
 of it.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.680
 I was like, yeah, I'm doing more of drums right now anyways.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.640
 But yeah, I ended up flipping it not that long ago.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.640
 That's a bum.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.640
 It's a connection.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.440
 Yeah, that would have been a great trade.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.400
 But you got the TR, you have the TR8S still, right?

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.400
 Yeah.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.880
 That's the only reason why I didn't get to the L9.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:22:00.520
 I was thinking, just getting it for-- I don't know.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.680
 I don't want to say authenticity because it's not a straight 909.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.200
 But it was close enough.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.360
 And I always-- having a 909 was my dream for decades.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.240
 So I was like, yeah, it would be cool to get-- even if I don't use it that much, I wouldn't

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.400
 mind having that thing decorating my desk.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.400
 You know what I mean?

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.840
 Just as a machine to play with and look at and admire from time to time.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.840
 It's beautiful.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.520
 It's not as playable as they could have made it.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.880
 But it's fucking good.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.520
 And if you don't-- the bitches, if you want to run it off USB power, that's not just a

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.080
 dedicated power outlet.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.880
 There's going to be a ground loop.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.520
 But it sucks because it would be-- it was convenient just to have it hooked up to my

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.280
 modular USB power.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.280
 You know, that was cool.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.000
 And then I realized it sounded like shit.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.720
 I don't know why they didn't build real power supplies for those.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.160
 But we've talked about that.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160
 Yeah.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:59.680
 But yeah, enjoying making acid music, I have three of them I can play with right now until

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.760
 I return Prezlop.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.520
 So it's pretty fun to play around.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:12.800
 So aside from that newer Roland 1, are you eyeballing any other possibilities right now

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.040
 instead of to replace the Behringer with?

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.040
 I would.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.200
 Maybe a modular or something.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:25.280
 If there was the Dinsync 303 stuff still available, the modules, I would get those.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.200
 That's the same boat I was into, yeah.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.200
 Yeah.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.200
 That was actually--

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.360
 I was like, man, I wish these were available.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.920
 I would jump on this right now and I would kind of kick myself in the ass for not when

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.920
 they were.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.920
 Yeah.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.400
 Also, Sean was wrong.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.520
 And that input on the TD3 is not a CV input.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.520
 I should have checked.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.440
 It's an audio input on the filter.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.440
 Yeah.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.440
 And that was a bummer.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.440
 Yeah.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.000
 It's like, I want the module because I want CV control over the filter because that just

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.120
 sounds like, you know, you know you're going to be able to take it to a different territory

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.120
 doing that.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.120
 Absolutely.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.640
 The Roland 1 has a-- had a gate in, I think.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.240
 Yeah, it does trigger in, which is cool.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.240
 Yeah.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.880
 So you can kind of get modular within that regard at least.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.880
 Mm-hmm.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.080
 Yeah, you can feed it some different sequences, which is nice.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.960
 I also realized I don't really like the OG 303 programming.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.720
 I guess nobody really does except for people who've pushed through that.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:29.040
 But the Tb3, the IR1, that's fucking so much easier to program a lot of things.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.040
 Yeah.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.080
 The sequence around that thing was something I miss as well.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.080
 Yeah.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.080
 It's awesome.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:41.280
 But yeah, I was never a huge fan of programming OG 303 stuff either.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.080
 I remember Ryan made fun of me for that one time.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.040
 Yeah.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.040
 I forget where we were.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.840
 We were at a gear store somewhere.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.640
 Or maybe we were messing with someone.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.640
 I can't remember.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.080
 But you knew that I could mess with acid stuff for a while.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.560
 We had many a discussion about it.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.520
 And then I kind of fell off track because I was--

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.200
 even the VSTs that I had, like, shit, what the hell was it?

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.120
 The D9 one or whatever?

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.120
 Oh, the F2.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.120
 F2 is so calm.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.120
 F2 is so calm.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.120
 Yeah, whatever.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.120
 Yeah.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.120
 Yeah.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.800
 I would put it into, like, free mode and I would just sequence it using, like, piano

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.080
 roll and stuff like that instead of, like, sequencing it on the onboard sequencer.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.800
 So I just didn't for OG 303 sequencing.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.800
 Yeah.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.920
 I remember the one time I was trying to do something and I couldn't remember off top

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.920
 of my head.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920
 I was like, shit, how's that work?

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.720
 And Ryan was just obviously like, wait, you don't know how to program a 303.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.520
 I'm like, I forget, dude.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.360
 I was like, I kind of always hated it.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:41.360
 And I just kind of, like, you know, stopped giving a shit about remembering how to do

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.280
 it because, like, any time I'd do acid, I would find some other way to program it.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.520
 Even on the-- what the hell was the round one that I had?

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.440
 Oh, the fucking revolution.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.440
 The revolution, yeah.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.440
 That was it.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.440
 Look.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.760
 Like, even the revolution, I was kind of taking external sequencers to that thing most

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.760
 of the time, you know?

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.800
 I mean, I had the 777, but I still don't miss that.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.800
 You had that?

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.800
 Yeah.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.400
 I depth-- that's how I got my 808 as I traded the 777.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.400
 Oh, dude.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.120
 I always wanted one of those.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.880
 It was cool.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.680
 Like, yeah, it was good, but people compare it to like a pro one.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.680
 And I don't know.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.680
 I've never really used a pro one, aside from that on the hook that I just built.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680
 That's kind of why I liked it.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:30.040
 It had that, like, more industrial vibe to it than the straight, like, 303 emulation.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040
 You know what I mean?

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.920
 It was like a weird base-sense sound of its own thing going on.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.440
 I always wanted one, but--

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.640
 It was way more than that.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.640
 Totally agreed.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.120
 Yeah, I had that Futurato XS, too, and I did not like it.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.680
 And that one was more MS-20 kind of filter.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.680
 Yeah.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:52.040
 I just don't-- I like his stuff for the way it's kind of designed, but I can never gel

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.680
 with the sound really.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.320
 Still want an Avalon, but--

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.320
 Yeah, that's--

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.880
 I don't think that's ever going to happen at this point.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.880
 That's the thing.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:06.360
 There's a perfect circuit has an RE-303 right now that didn't sync one, a black one that's

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.280
 actually 1,200 used.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.280
 That's by far the lowest I've seen for one of those, but that's not-- that's not happening.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.760
 I don't want-- yeah.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.200
 I'll spend $1,000 on a 303.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.200
 That's the thing.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.840
 Like, I don't know.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:29.240
 I've never heard huge, huge differences between a VST, you know, and like the OG.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:34.400
 Like my ear for acid isn't that well-trained.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:40.800
 I just know what I like and I know what I don't like when it comes to acid lines, but spending

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:47.240
 something that costs over $1,000 is just unjustifiable to me to make something that you can make for,

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.840
 you know, a Zoxbox.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.240
 Like you spent like, what, 300 on yours, you know?

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.240
 Yep.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.280
 The Barringer's 130, for fuck's sake.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.280
 Uh-huh.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.480
 You can get VSTs for even cheaper.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.480
 I don't know.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480
 It's hard to--

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.000
 You get the TB3 for like 120 bucks on eBay right now.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.920
 That's fucking-- that's really cool.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.720
 Like, as I was telling somebody, like nobody was bitching at the rave when that was ripping

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.720
 away.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.680
 Like, nobody's like, hmm, that kind of-- it's close to a 303.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.680
 Yeah.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.640
 It sounds good.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.280
 Nobody was bitching at the rave when that thing was ripping away.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.480
 What the fuck happens to me?

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.480
 We've already discussed-- uh, reverb, though.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.480
 Yeah, straddle.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.480
 I can't get back into that territory.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:34.880
 I was just saying how insane it is that people are charging well over a grand for 303 emulations

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.400
 at this point.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.040
 Like you said, Greg, it's-- there's more like-- for me, it's more there are certain reference

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.040
 points with music.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.040
 And a lot of it is weird plastic man shit that I know that when I hear it in the machine,

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.040
 I know like that it's right.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.640
 You know, it's just my total bias of it.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.560
 Like, I don't like distorted 303s.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.680
 I like when they go into like liquid territory and the shit that can happen there and like

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.680
 slides.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.800
 And I did-- I like the slide sounds from the TD3 so that'll be useful.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.200
 And it's really-- that's a lot of what I'm enjoying fucking with right now.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.200
 Yeah.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.120
 It's like the worm aspect of it, you know.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.920
 Yeah, fucking 303s.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.680
 Fuck 'em.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.680
 Fuck 'em.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.680
 I love 'em.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.280
 Wait, was that the takeaway from all that?

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.280
 Yeah, fuck ass.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.280
 Sorry, man.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.280
 Fuck 'em.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.880
 Yeah, if I'm having fun making ass--

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.480
 It is funny, though, how people will be like, "Oh, that--"

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:29.480
 That sound is so tired and then it's just like, everything is done, you know?

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.320
 Like, just enjoy it.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320
 It's all over.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.320
 There's nothing new.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.160
 I mean, that's kind of the mindset I was in for the longest time, dude.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.320
 That's why I was trying to avoid anything 303s for a while.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.720
 It's like, "Yeah, it's been done to death."

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720
 You know, I was like, "I don't need--"

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.720
 "Gree."

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.720
 "I don't need any more acid in my life."

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:50.320
 But like, after being off of it for so long and like-- just listening to a lot of

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.600
 break-horse stuff lately, like my passion for it has been rekindled.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.600
 That's all once again.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.320
 Yeah, I was there too, where I was like, "Oh, I'd never use that again."

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.120
 And then, it was that TB3, which is like-- I don't know.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.360
 I like to program that thing on the couch.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.520
 It's a lot of fun just to sit there with headphones.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.560
 It's USB powered, so fucking cool.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.480
 That might be the one I end up with in the end.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.480
 I'll just eventually record the baron-dr while I'm destroying it.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:24.480
 I'm doing demos on the poly and tracker with acid loops too,

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.320
 reminding me how much I used to love.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.040
 Hearing that and fucking around like that, you know,

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:37.720
 showing up stuff, nothing like shattering an acid line in a tracker with some broken

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.720
 beats.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.720
 You know what I mean?

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.720
 Oh, fuck yeah.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.120
 That to me is more like my speed when it came to acid stuff.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.440
 I never really got into too much acid techno, unless it was like--

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.440
 the super fucking distorted shit on top of Gabbar.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.440
 Like DJ Tron or DJ Paul, shit like that.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.440
 Blit-erating somebody's nice acid line through 20 preamps.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.440
 Shit like I just had like--

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.440
 I do like it.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.440
 Like if it's going to be distorted, I want it to be taken to that level.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.440
 Yeah.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.440
 I don't want like the-- I'm not a chemical brother fan,

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.440
 but I always hated like the distorted, like--

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.440
 it almost has like a subtitle like distorted 303 on like the movie caption, you know?

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.440
 It's like, ugh.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.240
 But yeah, when it's really blown the fuck out, like I've been that thing running through

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.440
 the effects aid has been fucking sick.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:32.440
 That's been like the signal path really is all the acid boxes through the effects aid

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.440
 and the H9 in parallel or series, I'm sorry.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.440
 Well that could be a good segue into the effects aid.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.440
 Truly.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.440
 You guys finally got them.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.440
 And I still don't.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.440
 The journey of the effects aids.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.440
 I'm a little bummed.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.440
 The white whale has been caught.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.440
 We just end the podcast now.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.440
 Still like--

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.440
 Got the white whale.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.440
 We got two of them through lights of fancy.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:09.440
 But like how do you get a module from Glasgow to Pittsburgh in like under 48 hours for like 12 bucks?

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.440
 And but signal sounds could do it.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.440
 They were the only place that had effects aids.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.440
 Tons of people bought them from the States and we all had them like the next day.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:22.440
 I think like at that point FedEx was just is still just trying to show up the USPS that's been

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:27.440
 crushed under the boot of fascism.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.440
 But yeah, signal sounds got the modules here.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:36.440
 We had another route that we actually ended up getting a second one through that I passed

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.440
 on to Dave.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.440
 Dave and I both have effects aids now.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.440
 What do you think about the effects aid?

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.440
 I think it's incredible.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:55.440
 The stereo in and stereo out is a nice touch and kind of amazing given it's only 4 HP.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.440
 Every algorithm I just have the original set of algorithms.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.440
 I haven't screwed with them yet.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.440
 Mainly because, you know, like I've sort of tried each of them but I've not dug in.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.440
 I've just got out of it just with the base set of algorithms.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.440
 There's plenty of them already.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.440
 And I have yet to find one that didn't sound good at least in some way.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:22.440
 Which I can't think of the multi effects I've ever had that everything sounded good.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.440
 Like this does.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.440
 Oh yeah, I fully agree.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:32.440
 Like if you couldn't upload more algorithms, I would still recommend it just as strongly.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:38.440
 If I had to pick one fucking effects processor in the studio hardware software that I could

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.440
 keep, it would be the effects aid.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.440
 I'm pretty comfortable with that.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.440
 Same here.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.440
 I don't know.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:49.440
 It's the amount of like there's a lot of a really small and cramped module granted the Excel was

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.440
 just released which is cool.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:59.440
 It's got the right amount of control that single CV in but also the wet dry in the sample rate

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.440
 stuff which is actually really cool and I haven't played with too much yet.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:07.440
 And like you said the full stereo path and the fact that it just sounds like it's just

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.440
 like kind of a little bit magical.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.440
 Yeah and the CV is assignable which I think is a nice touch.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:21.440
 Being able to be able to set what parameter you want the CV to control even like even

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.440
 the Pico DS he doesn't have that.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.440
 Isn't he doesn't have that sort of reassignable or configurability to it.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.440
 How do you do that?

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.440
 You have to use the software editor to set those parameters or use the buttons.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.440
 It's with the buttons.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.440
 Yeah.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.440
 Yeah it's real intuitive too because I'm getting a little worried.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:46.440
 I'm like oh this is crossing over into like a thousand button combinations but really the

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:52.440
 buttons are for left right algorithm select and then there's some holding down things for

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.440
 assigning the CV.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.440
 You assign the CV to which parameter which argument you want and then it's just it's

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.440
 persisted.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:05.440
 And also nice that some of the algorithms use a mono input and the second input is for

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.440
 the clock so you can do clocked delays and then do multiples of the delay time synced

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.440
 beats.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:15.440
 So it's like it covers everything basically.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:21.440
 It is funny sitting there because I have it like right beside the ZDSP and I can't get

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:28.040
 rid of the ZDSP because mainly for halls and Marianna trench but looking at the two of

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:33.840
 them I'm like alright I'm going to use this FXA that's 4 HP all the time and everyone

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.240
 wants it all to use this monstrous oversized ZDSP.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.440
 It's kind of painful to look at how much space.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.440
 Yeah I can like oh yeah or I can just get like six FXAids in that same space.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.440
 Yeah.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.440
 That's what like kind of throws me is they're both spin FV1s right.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.440
 I think the Pico DSP has also spin.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.440
 Oh no shit okay.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:59.000
 It's not like it's some crazy brand new hardware that they're you know they're just getting

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.440
 a lot out of this in a way that people have not in the past.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.440
 Right.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:09.440
 I mean I will say there's one obvious complaint and it's pretty minor especially considering

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:15.120
 it's an FX module and I'm not going to be you know sort of jamming on it that much.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.160
 The knobs are absurdly cramped.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.360
 Yeah they are.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.360
 It's a little intense.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:24.920
 It's full on like I can't turn all the way.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:29.640
 You sort of spin it like you're loosening a screw is how I've been using it.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.640
 It's a minor complaint.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.160
 If I was it was like a filter cut off or residence that I was like jamming on and needed to

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:39.560
 like have a lot of tactile control over it might be a bigger issue but I don't know I

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.160
 tend to just have a set it and forget it when it comes to FX.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.160
 Right.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:49.800
 It's kind of I was kind of surprised they used full knobs on there because you can get those

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:56.040
 tiny ones now from like Thonk that shit I don't remember what they're actually called

00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:02.920
 but they're like barely bigger than the the Jack you know what I mean like they save so

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:10.040
 much space like I had them on my Bifaco bursts.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.160
 They just came on there to like save space because that was a pretty cramped module too

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:20.280
 and they're like really nice you know kind of want to buy a bunch of them from Thonk

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.720
 and replace all the tiny knobs on some of my stuff with those but I don't think they

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:31.400
 come in D shaft I think they're shit whatever that other format is that set screws or whatever

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.400
 they are.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.400
 Yeah but I mean it's it's a super super minor.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:42.400
 I mean it's definitely not enough to dissuade anyone from getting it and I think the XL seems

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.000
 like it's maybe handling it a little bit better.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.680
 I'm not really I'm not rolling out getting an XL just for the extra little bit of space

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:54.200
 and stuff that it adds to it because you know if it's just this plus more there's nothing

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.600
 wrong with that sounds.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:03.160
 Yeah I want the XL definitely eventually when I get it looks the 4 HP one makes sense if

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.200
 you have the XL because that's like okay I've also got this tiny one that I can put into

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.840
 like a smaller rig and still get it done.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.840
 Yeah.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.920
 Yeah I'm kind of holding out for the XL now that it exists.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:19.760
 Yeah they were up on signal sounds too and they sold out with the quickness of course

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.720
 I think it was like 40 minutes.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.040
 I didn't even try to look I was like oh that's cool I'll get one of those someday.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.400
 I knew there was no possibility I mean getting one immediately so.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.440
 I mean great if you can find one I think I think you'll you will dig it I think it's

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.440
 um.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.680
 Delay with foul filter in the feedback loop.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.320
 That's the fucking hotness.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.280
 How many algorithms can you have loaded in there at a time?

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.280
 32.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:49.160
 Like there's more than like more exist than you can fit on there one time right so you

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.080
 got to kind of pick and choose what you want.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.080
 Okay.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.080
 Yep.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.560
 It's not a hard decision though I mean because there's a pretty good amount that you can

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.560
 put on it.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.640
 Did the XL expand upon how many you could have in there or is that still the same?

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.240
 Nope I think that's the same.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.240
 Right on.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:10.240
 Just further control more CV inputs dedicated sample rate reduction input which is cool.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.120
 Micro T18 knobs is what I was thinking of.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.960
 Good job.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.360
 You can get them from Thonk now.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:23.480
 They're pretty awesome but yeah they're T18 shaft only no D shaft unfortunately.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.440
 Hopefully they do they do both at some point.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:31.920
 Yeah I want to put some different ones on the 352 I'm just really tired of those fucking

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.760
 the ones that Paul uses look good and all but they're too big and you always nail the

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.440
 knob like the fuck the pitch up.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.560
 It's frustrating.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.640
 Something smaller would be cool.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.040
 While we're on the topic of effects I could dip into the noise engineering thing real

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.040
 quick.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.600
 Yeah I took a leap.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.520
 I decided to buy another module when I was trying to take a break and not buy any new

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.520
 shit.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.320
 So I'm just trying to get some recording done and I didn't want any more distraction

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.840
 or have to learn something new.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.360
 But I did it anyways.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:08.440
 I got the noise engineering desmodus versio.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.680
 I have no clue if I'm saying that correctly but close enough.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.680
 That's right.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:17.000
 Well we thought we were right before and then when we talked to them it turns out I think

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.320
 we were mispronouncing most of the module names at the time.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.440
 So I'm going to assume that we're mispronouncing this.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:30.640
 It's like pronouncing a taker or moog, moog.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.080
 We're just going to have their own variation of how they pronounce it.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.320
 I'm fine with that.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.400
 Auditure, Otter, Tomato, Tomato.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.280
 Is there a proper way to say Otter?

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.280
 Otter.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.280
 I think it's Otter.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.280
 That's what I thought.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280
 Okay.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.040
 Or is it just debatable?

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.040
 We'll never know.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.800
 Back to the desmodus versio.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.200
 I wasn't too hyped about it.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:00.120
 I don't think any of us were really after the demos that we saw from I believe it was

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.120
 too hyped.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.120
 Yeah.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:08.560
 The gentleman with the bed nail polish showing off.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.520
 White noise sounded through a shimmer algorithm.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:17.560
 I wasn't totally against it but it was entirely based on the idea that I trust noise engineering

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.320
 and I was like you know what this is probably just a fucked up demo.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.080
 I'm going to keep an open mind.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.080
 Yeah.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.600
 I tried to keep an open mind in the background.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:29.680
 I was like I'm not going to write this off based on these horrible demos.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:34.880
 I was like I'll see how it develops.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.160
 I took a gamble about it.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.440
 It's not the cheapest effects module out there.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.000
 It costs $3.45.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.320
 For kind of like a one tricky pony.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.320
 You know what I mean?

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.240
 What is the trick that it does well?

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:56.920
 Well, it's strictly reverb but it's a very malleable reverb.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:02.040
 You can take it into like weird delay territory as well.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.640
 It's not the smallest now that effects aid exists and it's definitely not the largest

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.040
 compared to like a ZDSP or something.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.040
 It's 10 HP.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.920
 It's like kind of middle ground territory there.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.120
 And yeah, it's stereo in, stereo out or mono in, stereo out.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.360
 So that was like right off the bat.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:29.680
 A significant improvement over the tip top Z-verb that I had which I just sold this week actually

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.440
 after playing with the Versio enough.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:37.720
 I was like yeah, this thing is definitely still in the spotlight.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:42.440
 I have a few criticisms of it but I'm just going to go over the important shit first

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.840
 that I like.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:48.960
 I like how they crammed that much functionality in there into a tiny package.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:56.840
 It doesn't feel cramped but it's definitely utilizing the full panel.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.240
 I like the form factor of it.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.320
 It's very reminiscent of other noise engineering modules.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:09.320
 It's got the two three way switches, the control, the different modes, all the knobs on there

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:14.440
 aren't full rotary which I'm very much into.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.720
 As we've discussed in the past.

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:25.920
 It feels more like the BIA than anything in my opinion and it pairs up with it very well.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:31.880
 I can easily see having a dedicated Versio for each BIA in your rig.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:36.480
 Like I have two BIA's currently and I want to get a second Versio just to have them like

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:47.160
 paired with the BIA's because it just opens up a lot more sonic possibilities from it

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.760
 more so than other verbs that I've paired with it.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:59.680
 It seems to be very percussion oriented which is one reason why I'm really into it.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:06.520
 I didn't need another big room, big hall sounding verb.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:12.360
 Like the Z DSP halls of a hall I already cover that territory pretty well.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:19.440
 In my herb herb I think can cover that some degree even though I usually use that for medium

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.440
 spaces.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:26.960
 Yeah, if it's running tiny sounds through it to give it more character I think is the

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.720
 strong point of it.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:34.040
 I was wondering what you meant by percussion but that makes total sense.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:40.120
 Just like letting that kind of space characterize the sound a little more than some wash.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:47.040
 Exactly, I feel like it really shines on as a percussion sound processor adding a stereo

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:56.880
 feel to smaller monophonic sounds or even smaller granular sounds.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:03.760
 For example something you're processing through clouds and you have it really tight, really

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:10.560
 short grains and you want to give that more space more manipulation.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.120
 I don't know just more manipulation.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:16.200
 You can pair the two up really nicely.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.360
 My experience is so far.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:25.080
 I wasn't hyped for the shimmer aspect of it at all that was featured in those early demos.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:32.120
 Never been a huge fan of shimmer but even when you have this thing in shimmer mode you

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:37.040
 can take it down into other territories, weird delays, things like that where it doesn't

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.640
 sound like your typical shimmer.

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.800
 It just sounds like something unique.

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.360
 You can really sculpt with it so far.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.040
 You have three different reverb modes.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.800
 You have limit, distort and shimmer.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:59.760
 Limit is very clean, has integrated limiting to keep the feedback way under control.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.960
 It won't go off the rails.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:07.640
 Then you got the distort which is like lo-fi saturation verb and then your shimmer which

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:13.720
 is your standard pitch shifting shimmer stuff.

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:19.080
 But then on top of those three modes you have three different modes that control how the

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.240
 regeneration and delay lines are handled.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:27.120
 You have blend, interpolate and jump.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.640
 Blend is very smooth, it's cross-fated.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:37.400
 When you shift the delay lines you can hit this mode very hard with CV and it's going

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.480
 to keep everything intact.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:44.520
 It's not going to sound like when you're just tweaking the time knob on a delay pedal type

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520
 of thing.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.920
 It keeps the shifts smooth.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.840
 Interpolate, you start to get that type of typical pitch shifting effects with the delay

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.160
 line shift and all that.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:06.000
 Then you have jump which is more like glitchy, drastic jumps in between the delay line shifts.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:13.720
 Between those six modes you can get into a lot of different areas.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:19.080
 It is kind of a one trick reverb but at the same time you have enough flexibility there

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:24.000
 where you can do all kinds of different sounds with it's one trick.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 I guess you could say.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.240
 Do you see yourself keeping this or is this something that you don't see having along the

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.240
 lifespan?

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.080
 I'm kind of loving it already.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:41.200
 I don't think it's going to be going anywhere anytime soon.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:47.440
 Like I said I do a lot with percussion and this fits in with that very well so I don't

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.680
 see me flipping it for anything else at the moment.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.720
 There's nothing else that I own currently or would like to own that I think would do

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.240
 this better.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:03.120
 I mean you can use this for like bigger verbs but I just don't think that's a strong point.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:07.560
 You could probably do your blade runner stuff through it.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:16.720
 But as I kept messing with it to my ears I kept hearing skinny puppy mangled delay drums

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:21.040
 or like oddature style percussion glitching.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:27.520
 It's more of a mangler than just like a set it and forget it reverb.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:34.280
 Like it kind of begs to be modulated and hit with envelopes and accompany percussive

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.280
 stuff.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.280
 So yeah I'm digging it.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.280
 Like I said like it pairs with clouds very well.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:50.480
 It's like a Riggs and Murtaugh type of buddy system I got going on there with between the

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.480
 two.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:57.120
 It's like a lethal weapon of modulation and mangling one could say.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.320
 But you're not too old for this shit.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.160
 I am too old for this shit.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.720
 Oh god, definitely.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:11.240
 But yeah no clouds have still never gone you know anywhere recently in my rig and I feel

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.160
 like this is going to pair very well with it and with my other noise engineering stuff

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:19.800
 and with my drum modules in general.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:27.120
 Also has a tone knob which is important to me and is definitely going to add to like

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.840
 the longevity of this thing in my rig.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:37.360
 Like all of my favorite reverbs whether it be a VST or a pedal or a module have been

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.320
 ones that feature tone control.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.760
 And this one I love how they implemented it here.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.600
 It sounds good.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:51.520
 If you like a 12 o'clock there's no filtering applied and then as you move clockwise it

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.840
 goes through high passing and it sounds pretty nice.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:01.440
 Anywhere counterclockwise you start low passing and you can get pretty dark territory out

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.440
 of it.

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:07.800
 It sounds like it adds some resonance but not like out of control you know like I don't

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:14.000
 know what type of filter circuit it is but it's pleasing in my ears.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:22.040
 Being able to high pass the processed signal is especially good in my mind for percussive

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.760
 and drum processing.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.360
 You know what I mean.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:32.640
 Doing weird reverb mangling was always something I would do pre-distortion and so being able

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:38.080
 to get the low end in control without having to patch the wet signal through like another

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.240
 filter or anything like that.

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:45.280
 Pretty convenient before hitting like my saturation circuits and things like that.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:52.640
 Yeah overall digging it my criticisms are minor which I could start getting into I suppose.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.440
 There's no time like the present to get into criticisms.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:03.400
 So first criticism is that the CV inputs while there's a lot of them they're all zero to

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.880
 plus five.

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:10.920
 Never been a huge fan of positive only CV inputs.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.440
 I've always been a fan of bipolar.

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.440
 Same.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:18.400
 Yeah so a little bummed to see that on here.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.480
 But you know like I said envelopes work well with it so I've been using my Zadar with it

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:25.000
 and things like that.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.680
 Because it's so much easier for digital stuff you know it's a lot simpler if they can just

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.640
 deal with positive zero to five.

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:34.640
 Right.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.000
 But not for us.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:44.640
 Right yeah and I get that but I have seen many digital modules with negative voltages

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:49.240
 you know compatibility so it's like I don't mean maybe it adds to the cost overall and

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.040
 they were trying to keep it you know not as expensive or something.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.040
 Not sure.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.200
 Just something I would have liked to have seen.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.200
 Yeah for sure.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.400
 ER301 does it with no issues.

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:08.040
 Yeah but yeah the other minor criticism is there's no pre-delay or clock sync.

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:13.000
 Yeah I would have liked to have seen that for sure.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.920
 Again like I can see how there's no possible way they could have crammed that into the

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:22.960
 panel in its current state it's pretty full.

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.840
 But if I don't know if they were to increase the size by like another two to four HP I

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.280
 feel like they could probably have fit that on there and that would have made this all

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:36.280
 the more better you know especially for percussion processing and things like that.

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:42.680
 You could have had things in sync to your clock or you know shift the clock in conjunction

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:48.600
 with your percussion sequences things like that CV control the pre-delay like I do a

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:57.640
 lot on like the herb verb for example just to give things a weird glitchy character.

00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:03.680
 It's just one of my top favorite features of reverbs and this one is lacking it.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.560
 So it's a bit of a bummer.

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:14.080
 Maybe they'll do like an expansion panel at some point to add some more features to it.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.880
 I don't know if that's something they would ever consider but if they do I feel like that

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.440
 would be something to add to it.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:24.800
 Did it look like there were expansion pins on the back of it?

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:30.400
 I didn't really inspect the back too closely I saw a USB jack which I guess is used to

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.960
 update it and things like that or to load the other firmware which will be coming in

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:41.080
 the future but yeah I didn't really check other connections.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:46.640
 And then I guess my last criticism was there's no CV control of the two three-way switches

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.200
 that control all the different modes.

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.240
 That's pretty common for them.

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:57.560
 Very common and you know confused me being that it's such a staple with like other noise

00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:02.440
 engineering modules that they didn't implement it here.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:05.960
 Like at first I thought maybe I was just missing something and there was some way to do it.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:12.480
 I had to like read the manual and I was like no there's definitely no way to do this.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.320
 Again probably just due to the fact that they couldn't fit more jacks in its current

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.720
 state.

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.160
 So again like they were to make it a little bigger or add an expansion.

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.920
 I would love the CCV control over that.

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:29.480
 Read a lay with clock sink in and other than that like I think.

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:32.480
 So I think that's a good thing.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:00.480
 I think that's a good thing.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.480
 Maybe.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.480
 Just me flipping them around manually was fun for me.

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:10.480
 As I was doing it, I was like, man, I really wish I could do this using CV.

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:14.480
 They keep calling it a reverb, but to me I'm just calling this thing a manger.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.480
 I feel like that's what it's best at.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:22.480
 That would have just opened up so many more doors to mangling possibilities if you could

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.480
 hit those with gates and things like that.

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:31.880
 Even if it made it a little bigger or a little more expensive, I would gladly pay to a few

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:36.480
 extra bucks to have that type of functionality on this thing.

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.880
 It's going to be open source, they say, by the end of the year, and they're going to

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:41.880
 have different firmware.

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:47.480
 Maybe there'll be other firmware that will be open that up.

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:52.280
 Maybe they'll steal one of the other CVs and apply it to that mode.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.280
 I mean, it seems like something you could do in a firmware update.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:59.280
 If someone has similar idea to you, that's what they would rather have.

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.280
 Sure.

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:04.280
 Because in its current state, it kind of feels like it wants to be everything like, oh,

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.280
 do you want to do big shimmery reverbs?

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:10.280
 You can do that, or if you want to use it as a CV manger, you can do that too.

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:15.280
 Maybe someone will make some firmware that is strictly like, yes, this is 100% for fucking

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:23.280
 shit up, mangling audio, creating strange, time shifting spaces and textures.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.280
 Parasite, just kind of--

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.280
 Your Parasite firmware version.

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.280
 Exactly.

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:34.280
 And add that type of CV control over the mode switches and things like that.

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.280
 It is a versatile vampire.

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.280
 Yeah.

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.280
 That's what that means, right?

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.280
 Yeah.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.280
 I like it.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.280
 It's got a little bat on it.

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:46.280
 It's got a super proper goth.

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.280
 Unlike the-- what was it?

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:53.280
 The Teretas Manus that I call it, the mall goth version of the BIA.

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.280
 Right.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.280
 Yeah.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.280
 The Versios proper goth.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.280
 I like it.

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:07.280
 This dude-- he's listening to some bot house and trying himself to sleep every night.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:12.280
 If we were going to knob con this year, I would be trying to get some time with their--

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.280
 bigger percido modules.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:21.280
 I would like to try the-- I think it's the Manus percido maybe, is the one that might be interesting.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:26.280
 Because I think it had some wave table shit, if I can remember.

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.280
 Right.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.280
 But yeah, neither of us-- I think we texted about it a couple weeks ago.

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:36.280
 But I've-- it was never-- you know, there's the Teretas-- curses the Teretas and the Lokelic

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.280
 a Teretas percido.

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:41.280
 I think I've tried the Lokelic and I know that's just the regular one with envelopes.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.280
 But I'd like to try the curses.

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.280
 I'm not going to buy it though.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.280
 I want to play with it first.

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.280
 Yeah, I've never taken the leap to get the big ones.

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.280
 I've always done the smaller ones.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:57.280
 And although I've enjoyed most of them with the exception of the Manus, mainly because

00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.280
 I couldn't stand the full rotary knobs.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.280
 Like, that just bothered me.

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:05.280
 I couldn't-- you know, it's harder for me to dial in my sweet spots.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:10.280
 Like, I've enjoyed most of them, but I feel like none has ever, like, usurped the ability

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.280
 to be a player like you served the BIA for me.

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:18.280
 Like, I feel like that is still like their strongest, most well thought out classic module.

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:22.280
 And it's going to be hard to beat, I think.

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:30.280
 And this vampire, I think, you know, is going to be up there with the BIA as being like a classic

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:35.280
 module in their lineup and pairs well with the BIA, like nothing else.

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:42.280
 Like, even if you're just using it as like a weird, you know, to give the BIA a little bit

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:46.280
 of stereo width and like some filtering using the tone functionality.

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.280
 Like, you don't even have to dip into all the delays and things like that.

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.280
 I think it's cool in that regard.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:56.280
 Like, I've been having a lot of fun with it so far more than I expected.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.280
 So, the tip top is out.

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.280
 No more Z-verb.

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:06.280
 And the Versio is in sitting right next to my herb verb and my Z-DSP.

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.280
 You've had the herb verb for a hot minute now, too.

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.280
 I can't imagine you ever letting that go.

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.280
 I don't think I ever will, no.

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:18.280
 Every time I think that I'm bored of it, I find some other use for it.

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:24.280
 Like, there's just so many ways to use it that keeps me happy with it.

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:33.280
 Even if, like, I'm not processing with it, like, just using it as a, like, zero input feedback generator.

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:37.280
 Like, I've gotten so much mileage out of it in that regard.

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:42.280
 Like, it's just a staple in my rack, just like the halls of a holla.

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:49.280
 You know, like Dave was saying, like, as big as the Z-DSP is and, you know, how much juice that thing is drawn off the rails

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:55.280
 and everything, just to run a single reverb algorithm with three controls.

00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:02.280
 It's just a classic sound that I don't see going anywhere out of my rig anytime soon, at least.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:10.280
 That's, like, I think going to be my three staples now when it comes to my big digital processing.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:14.280
 Versio, herb verb, Z-DSP.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:18.280
 Hopefully, someday, I'll be able to squeeze an Fx8 in there, too.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.280
 But, yeah, that's all I have to say about the vampire.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.280
 Versio.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.280
 What else is on people's lists?

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.280
 It's on your list.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.280
 What's on my list?

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.280
 Um, I had the Fx8 on my list.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:42.280
 Um, I have something on my list that's probably not worth being on my list, but I will mention that, uh,

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:50.280
 um, sort of through searching on modular grid, I think other people have found things in a similar sort of way of, like, um, what's this?

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.280
 I didn't know this existed.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:01:04.280
 Um, after later, uh, audio, they make a bunch of mutable stuff, including some, um, one-U tiles in IntelliJail form.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.280
 I could basically not get the plum audio.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.280
 Um, peaks knock off in ornament and crime.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.280
 So, why couldn't- why doesn't that work?

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.280
 They still try to sell things on reverb, right?

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.280
 I don't know how that's- I couldn't get anything to work, uh, buying off of them.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.280
 And they- I was emailing back and forth with them.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.280
 They were trying to think, "Oh, we're so sorry.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.280
 We needed an update to our store and try again."

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.280
 And it wasn't working for me.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.280
 And after, like, it was a couple of weeks.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:37.280
 I really wanted it and, um, you know, they were given, like, a pretty serious effort to get this to work.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.280
 So, I was like, "Okay, yeah, yeah, give it a shot."

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.280
 We both didn't work.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.280
 That's still an end reverb.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.280
 Yeah, neither of them worked.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:51.280
 Um, and so I basically just gave up on- which was a bummer, but then I came across these, um, after later ones.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.280
 And they make a peaks one.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.280
 They've got this dual, um, VCA.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:01.280
 And, uh, what I ended up getting was, um, the one-U peaks.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:08.280
 And they've got a 4-HP version of, um, but it's only two channel- two VCA's of, um, mutables, vase.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:19.280
 Um, which I want, uh, for turning my palette into imagining someday in the future being able to actually play live, uh, live shows again.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.280
 Um, do you remember those?

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.280
 Yeah.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.280
 Yeah, me neither.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:35.280
 Um, but this- this idea of having a- like a small- using the palette for, like, a smaller live setup, you know, being able to just have, like, a two voice, having these two VCA's, and then being able to just use them as a mixer.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.280
 Um, 'cause if you don't have the first one going out, um, it just normal, so the second.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.280
 Yeah, I was like, this is saving a ton of space.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.280
 Only 4-HP, 2-VCA's. That one's not very exciting.

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:53.280
 But yeah, the- the one-U peaks I'm very excited about, and the version of the firmware that they have, um, is also very exciting.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.280
 Uh, yeah, that is who the mods they put on that.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.280
 Yeah.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.280
 Um, I- unfortunately I have nothing else to say about this.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:08.280
 I literally got this, like, an hour before we started recording, so this is a sneak preview of, um, of maybe what I'll talk about next time.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:13.280
 But what I do have to talk about is the WMD Carbon, or Keforbin.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.280
 Oh, right.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280
 Keforbin.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.280
 Um, my intention was to get this to pair with Dark Matter.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:25.280
 'Cause right now I've got, um, or, you know, before I got this, I had a microfold and a filter.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:30.280
 Basically, to sort of process the feedback going out and back into, um, Dark Matter.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:38.280
 And then I saw the Keforbin. It's- 'cause it's got, um, three dedicated outs, low-pass, uh, band pass and high-pass.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.280
 But then also this four-pole out.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:46.280
 You can set it to have, um, the Synchronine wave folder on the output.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.280
 So I was like, ooh, get a little bit of wave folding on top of the filter.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.280
 This might really be killing a lot of birds with one stone.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.280
 Um, and it has a saturation circuit going into it.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:02.280
 And it has, uh, sort of like these four-course modes, like, you know, like off a little bit, a little bit more.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.280
 And what I imagine is all the way on.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.280
 But you can also control that with CV if you want to like dial in the saturation.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:14.280
 Saturation is real subtle. It is not- it's not real TV, but, um, you know, it's nice to have.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:21.280
 Um, I'm willing to bet it's probably the same saturation circuit from the, uh, Crater kick drum module.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:29.280
 It was kind of subtle on there too. It had like three different modes, but they were all kind of like a little more on the subtle saturation side of things.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:34.280
 It would not be my choice if, for like the only saturation, if you were interested in that sound.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:39.280
 Um, but it's nice to have, has a little bit of- takes something a little bland and gives it a little kick.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:46.280
 Um, I- overall, I really like this module. I'm gonna use it, but not what I thought I was gonna use it for.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:53.280
 The problem is there's basically no control over the wave shaping that comes out.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:05:02.280
 Um, you just sort of turn it on and it seems as- it has a relationship with the, um, where the resonance is at, seems to be like dictates its behavior.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.280
 But for the most part, it's just kind of off on its own, doing its own thing.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:14.280
 So it's really hard to dial in, um, with a dark matter and trying to get like, you know, this- this feedback loop going

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.280
 and having something that has so little control.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:27.280
 So I'm not gonna use it what I intended for, but as a live filter, um, which they kind of promoted it as such, um, Alex from WMD, his video,

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:31.280
 which, you know, on one hand sold it to me, I'm like, "Oh, I really wanna get this."

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.280
 But on the other hand, he's kept talking about like, "Oh, this is great for live."

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:39.280
 And maybe it's just my contrarian nature. I'm like, "Fuck that. I'm not gonna use this live. Don't tell me how to use this."

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:46.280
 Like, um, and then after having it for a week, I'm like, "Oh, this is- yeah, I'm definitely gonna use this for live."

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:53.280
 Um, there's a lot of cool stuff, just, um, switching modes on that, um, the- the- the four-pole out.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:06:02.280
 Um, you can do it so you can switch, highlight the one that you want, but if you're holding it down, it won't actually switch to that mode until you let go.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.280
 So you can sort of try to time it, um, with beads.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:12.280
 Same with, um, the wave folder is a button. Um, so you can turn that on and off in time with what you're doing.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:19.280
 The- the filter cutoff has a lot of different ways to- to, um, modulate it, as FM, sort of standard modulation on top of it,

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.280
 and a 10- new-verter that controls that, but it also tracks, uh, a volt per octave.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:30.280
 So you can send a sequence, maybe the same sequence from your oscillator, maybe a different one if you wanna try to do it- uh, screwing things up with that.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:42.280
 Which, you know, isn't really breaking tremendous new ground, but having all of this in, you know, a really well-designed and good sounding, um, or HP filter.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:50.280
 Um, yeah, like I said, it's not what I- it's not what I wanted, uh, but now that I have it, I'm- I'm glad I do.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.280
 Word. Yeah. I was curious about it.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:57.280
 I didn't wanna dip into any more filters, though.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:03.280
 I was like, eh, like, I'll wait to see how Dave reacts to it.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.280
 Yeah, I'm right there with you on the filters.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:11.280
 Yeah, and it's not breaking new ground, especially like, um, still have the bionic luster, uh, still have the gristleizer.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:22.280
 I still have the Jove filters. Those are- those are the ones that have a ton of character, um, and they're- and they're part of making the sound, you know, like they're- they're- they're key-compulsive.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:29.280
 This is a little bit more- I wouldn't go so far to say that it's like bread and butter or like Polaris-level boring.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:33.280
 Which- which is funny because it's actually thinking about getting a Polaris again.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:44.280
 Like, that's actually kind of what I'm in the market for. Like, I have enough filters with character at this point, that I'm looking for something tiny footprint that just handles band pass filtering.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:47.280
 You- I didn't know you went back to zero Polaris.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.280
 Yeah, I haven't had any for a minute now.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:08:07.280
 I- I got rid of them to get the Morgasmatron, which- as much as I love as a like, MS-20 style dual mode filter, um, the- the band passes are kind of not that steep and not that great, you know.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:16.280
 Like, I was using my multiple Polaris as a lot to get surgical with things in like the steepest band pass modes and things like that with a little bit of saturation at the end.

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:24.280
 And, um, I don't really have anything like that now. Like, even my- well, my Belgrade's- or Belgrade's rather.

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:36.280
 Um, you definitely have like multiple different band pass modes, but they're also like huge and very like character driven filters and I like to keep them in use for that.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:44.280
 But I need some small filters with a nice steep band pass to get a little extra surgical on things with.

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:52.280
 I would- I mean, I'm- a- I have a Polaris for sale. If you want my Polaris, I'll sell it to you. Good price.

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:59.280
 I might be into that. Um, I mean, the price does include things like your blood and some teeth.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:07.280
 I like how, as you just start to say that, some weird-as haunting sounds just started happening in the background of your mic.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.280
 Oh, it's a train-out-by.

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:16.280
 I would say it sounded like- It was good. Yeah. Some sort of industrial soundscape was starting in the background.

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:22.280
 But, you know, I have both of those in my house right now and I'm more excited about the carbon.

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:30.280
 Um, because I think it does what Polaris does well, but also has a couple of extra things that are nice for performance.

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:37.280
 Uh, and you can add a little bit more excitement than the Polaris, um, when you need to with, like I said, the saturation and-

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:43.280
 um, the wave folding on the output. So I don't- I don't know. I think maybe you should check it out.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:48.280
 It's like literally half the size of a Polaris. I think it's less. Cause I think the Polaris is 10.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:57.280
 Is it? Okay. I was thinking eight. Yeah. This is less than half. Um, I think we're talking about the same thing because if I had to choose a filter, it would not be this.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:06.280
 Yeah, it would- it would probably be a Bionic Lester or the Joe filters because I get a lot out of those. Um, but if I- but-

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:14.280
 but as far as this sort of utility filter, um, yeah, this is- this is the one- this is the one for me.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:22.280
 Picked my curiosity. I'm gonna check it out. All right. I- I- I- I- I've let him also somehow talk to myself out of a sale.

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:27.280
 I was hoping we were gonna fix that misconnection earlier, but no.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.280
 You're not a very good salesman.

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:34.280
 You want to say I'm selling? It's not as good as this other thing. You probably shouldn't get it. Nevermind. I'm sorry I asked.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.280
 That's how you sell. That's how you sell coffees for closers.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:49.280
 I'm actually- I'm sitting here looking at this after later audio pachinko, which is- I think somebody else made a version of marbles called pachinko because it's too obvious, but I swear I almost hate to say this.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.280
 I think their panel may be better than the original marbles. The after later one.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:01.280
 Yeah, after later audio pachinko. It just- even looking at it, I'm like, oh, that makes so much fucking sense and it's eight. There's six HP smaller.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.280
 More than the OG marbles? Or the smaller- okay.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:18.280
 I love marbles panel. That's one of the few panels that like I didn't replace or shrink because I kind of like how everything's spaced and labeled on it.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:22.280
 I don't like how the buttons are on it to change like the modes. I don't know why.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.280
 No.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:28.280
 This one just- yeah, if you look at this pachinko, it's just like, I don't know. It's just- it makes more sense.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:38.280
 I mean, the build quality on them, like I said, I've had them for exactly an hour and 27, 28 minutes.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:45.280
 Unlike the baronger that you felt you could crush in your hand, these were very well built.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:49.280
 I've high hopes that they'll last for a while.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:57.280
 That is the end of my list. I really- at some point I'm going to talk about the memory palace, but that's, I guess, I will keep that for the future.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.280
 I've had it from once now.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.280
 Yeah. And you've been using the shit out of it, right?

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:08.280
 Yeah, yeah. It's everything we talked- everything we had hoped and sort of dreamed in our "Lobcon" episode.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:14.280
 And I mean, there's been a firmware update since then. Yeah, it's fantastic.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:19.280
 I want one. I definitely need one.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.280
 I don't even really want the audio stuff.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:27.280
 There's bigger noise-enching. Hearing things are more of a curiosity, but I'm not.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:35.280
 I have too many things. I still want to- I want to get a Bibo. I want to get a Paulian tracker.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.280
 I did order the- the- the digit.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.280
 Oh. Oh, cool. That is cool.

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:45.280
 Yeah, it's still- I ordered that a few weeks ago and they said it's basically going to be like two months.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.280
 Would we talk about that last episode?

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:53.280
 No. But we talked about what we're eating our socially distanced back.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.280
 Right, right. I didn't know if we had talked about it.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.280
 Which was like- that was like a pseudo episode that didn't get recorded.

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:06.280
 Sitting in a parking lot eating vegetarian cheesecks.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:12.280
 Seeing each other for the first time in six months and all we could do is talk about goddamn music here.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:15.280
 And I couldn't even make eye contact with anyone.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.280
 Yeah, just staring at the gravel.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:23.280
 So, I got this thing. I can do Convolution Reverb.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:28.280
 I'm gonna ship from Australian two months. I'm really excited.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:36.280
 Well, actually I have my hands on one. And in a different social distancing meet with Russ from Evetan.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.280
 We should have as a guest sometime.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.280
 Oh, yeah. Why are we supposed to do that?

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.280
 I think we're supposed to do that. Yeah.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.280
 Sorry, Russ. Sorry, Russ.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.280
 This will happen, Russ. Something.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.280
 Pandemic is over.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.280
 I mean, he could join us on one of these.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:58.280
 It could. I feel I'd be more fun to have our first guest back for a while in person.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.280
 Oh, yeah. I totally agree.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:05.280
 Yeah. But he was giving me a bunch of monitors that I can use for video stuff.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:12.280
 Which is great because one of them was a security camera that wirelessly hooks up or can beam to a camera.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.280
 So, like, I can just do sort of like these infinite feedback.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:21.280
 That's not what we're talking about. What we're talking about is the digit.

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:28.280
 So, while they're getting these from him, there's also this like this beautiful green monochrome monitor I got for him.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:31.280
 It's stunning. It is. Yeah.

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.280
 Like just feeding anything into it and watching it.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:37.280
 Invert it into these sort of green gradients and like.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.280
 I love green monochrome, dude.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:42.280
 Yeah. Fucking beautiful. Deceivately. Yeah.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.280
 Again, not what we're talking about. He had.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.280
 He has a digit.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:52.280
 It was showing me how it works and all of the setup and I was blown away.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.280
 I'm still confused as to why it's a pedal.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.280
 It should just be a little synth box thing.

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.280
 Why does it go right to that? That's the thing.

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:05.280
 Russ was the one who convinced me to look into it actually.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:10.280
 The reason why it's in like the pedal form, well not the reason but a reason.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:14.280
 It was originally meant to be a cab simulator.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.280
 Like that was its main purpose when he started on it.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.280
 Like it was just doing cab simulations.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:25.280
 So you could have like multiple, you know, kind of like a tar rig in a box.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:32.280
 You know what I mean? You could have multiple different ways to process your guitar through cabinet

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.280
 simulations and this and that.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.280
 So you don't have to lug around giant amp cabs.

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:40.280
 You know what I mean? Or buy the expensive one.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:43.280
 Access. They make the people that made the virus.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.280
 That's what they make now is the Kemper audio shit.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.280
 They just make amp sims.

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.280
 Really? Yeah, there's a market for that.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:56.280
 And it does. It looks, you can even see it looks like the virus tie front panel uses like the same knobs and the same screen, I think.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.280
 Interesting.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:03.280
 But yeah, I guess he was trying to tap into that market. That was its purpose at first.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:12.280
 But somewhere along the line like nerds like us started being like seeing the potential of that interface and form factor there.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:17.280
 It's like PD in a box or like almost a reactor in a box.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.280
 It really is.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:26.280
 The digit that I'm going to be using mainly for like convolution, burb and things like that.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:33.280
 But I also want to get the B-bow to accompany it as like PD in a box.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.280
 You know what I mean?

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:41.280
 You can even load up like he has the code for plates in there and clouds and things like that.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:54.280
 So like I don't know why because I already have these in my modular, but I'm kind of like tickled by the concept of like being able to load up multiple instances of them.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:17:00.280
 In a little pedal that I can have sitting next to my modular.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:04.280
 I might even be able to trim down my modular a little bit.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:09.280
 Well that was the thing I thought was really appealing was the idea of being able to use this in a live setting.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.280
 Exactly.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.280
 Live setting is the big one.

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:18.280
 I don't have to drag out two cases of stuff just to have like my plates and my clouds and some modulation.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:21.280
 I can have that all in something the size of a fucking guitar pedal.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:32.280
 You know like that's and I can save my configuration and my patches and not have to worry about them getting jacked up or worry about breaking my modular and someone spilling beer on it.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:38.280
 And if you're so inclined, if there's something about these that you don't like, just open it up and change it.

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.280
 Yeah.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:46.280
 So I think the digit and the B-bow together is going to be a really fucking powerful like workspace.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:53.280
 And I'm kind of tempted once I get them both to just try and make like an EP primarily using them.

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.280
 That'd be cool.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:57.280
 Yeah, I don't know why I'm just really excited about it.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:15.280
 Probably because for years and years like us three and like Ryan and others we've always had like such in-depth conversations about how we fucking hate the laptop and how great it would be to have like a nice portable interesting interface that could run you know like our favorite

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.280
 type of VSTs.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.280
 And while this isn't that, it's like kind of better than that.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.280
 You know what I mean?

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:34.280
 Like the modules and stuff and the code that he's loading into these things do exactly what I would be doing with VSTs anyways and like modulating convolution verbs fucking up granular shit, you know, generating plates percussion.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.280
 So yeah, I'm really stoked on it.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.280
 It's just the wait time is pretty heavy right now.

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.280
 That's the bummer is that I found out about this like way too late.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:53.280
 Like if it was months ago before basically people figured this out, you know, I don't think Russ waited that long to get his.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.280
 You know, there was a window where you could have gotten one easily.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.280
 The hype train is rolling now.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:03.280
 People are starting to you know pay attention to these plus the guy Pauli FX.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:09.280
 He's like a one man band in Australia soldering these by hand.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:14.280
 So he's cranked in my mouth as fast as you can, but it's like a two month minimum waiting period right now.

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:20.280
 So I'm for our listeners and for me because I'm not as close to this topic.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.280
 There's the bebo and the digit.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:25.280
 It's just two different firmwares on the same hardware, right?

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.280
 Yes, same pedal.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:38.280
 I mean, if you order them from him directly, the digit will be a different color than the bebo like the kind of think right now the, I think the digit is hot pink and the bebo is baby blue.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:42.280
 If I recall what a high level what it's the difference between the two.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:49.280
 The main difference between the two is that the digit is still at like at the core a processor.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:55.280
 It's like it's got all kinds of cap simulation distortion and convolution reverbs.

01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:04.280
 Like a wide range of different things that you can do with convolution verb and granular verb with our call and delays and things like that.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:17.280
 So seems like an IDM processing box that you can get completely modular with and reroute things in the whole nine yards.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:24.280
 Whereas the bebo I think is more like a synth in a box.

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:38.280
 It's like they described as like PD in a box or like generators versus just yeah exactly macro oscillator code and things of that nature percussion.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.280
 Yeah, okay, so it's just going to be looking for inputs on the one.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.280
 I believe so.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.280
 Yeah.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:47.280
 The differences were not all that clear to me either.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:53.280
 All I knew is that I liked both firmware and I was like well I like both firmware.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:58.280
 I don't want to be bouncing in and out, you know, like reloading it on the same device all the time,

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:03.280
 especially because it seems so appealing to run them in conjunction with each other.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:10.280
 So I would rather just have two each running their own dedicated bebo and digit firmware.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:17.280
 No wonder do they have like some front end that you can do the shit in that's not the pedal and then push stuff on there.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.280
 Or is it you're going to do this all through the pedal interface.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.280
 As far as I know you do it all in the interface but it looks nice.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.280
 Like it's a real responsive touchscreen.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:31.280
 You can get a stylus and drag things around very very like audio mulch looking right.

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.280
 That's what it looks like.

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.280
 Ben.

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:39.280
 Ben Flashball did a episode on his YouTube channel to kind of going over the differences between the two.

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:47.280
 But even after watching like his 30 some minute video still wasn't 100% clear to me the differences between the firmware.

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.280
 You know what I mean?

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:54.280
 As far as like a grasp is one is mainly processing the others mostly generators.

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:57.280
 They both seem to be fun.

01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.280
 Laughing thinking about that.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.280
 Do you remember that we are the music makers?

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.280
 Oh yeah.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.280
 Yeah.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.280
 Yeah.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:08.280
 I think it's a flash bulb that was one time that he was supposed to use trying to make like a circular sign wave.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.280
 Or a circular wave form.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:13.280
 It was just like you know there's a logical impossibility there.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.280
 The arguments were pretty gold.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.280
 Sorry.

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.280
 I haven't heard of flash bulb in a while.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.280
 That's what I immediately think of.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.280
 I did get some of his YouTube videos.

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:23.280
 He seems like a chill dude these days.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:32.280
 And he went into depth about these poly pedals but still was a little unclear to me.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.280
 I was like what does what?

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:37.280
 I'm like well there's only one way to find out and I'm just going to have to get them both.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:49.280
 I mean I get overly hyped about a lot of things before they're actually in my hands but they do seem like the perfect fucking solution for what I've wanted live for many many years now.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.280
 So a little stoke.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:23:01.280
 I think two of those and like maybe a poly-end tracker and that could be my live setup for a while.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:05.280
 I mean if live performances ever fucking exist again.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:28.280
