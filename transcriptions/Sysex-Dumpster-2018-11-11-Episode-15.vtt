00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 [Music]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 [Music]

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 [Music]

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 I mostly forgot actually.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Yeah, because it was kind of forgettable.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Yeah, much.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 [Laughter]

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 All I remember was going to the cheesecake factory.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Yeah, we did that.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Cheesecake Factory rocked.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 You flipped the script on cheesecake factory.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 You were not a fan before this.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 I went from a total hater to a fan.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 I signed up to the cheesecake of the month fan club.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 No.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 I hope that the structure

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 stole the show at knob con.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 I think that was like, I know that was the main thing that I remember

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 to remember.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Not only the at the booth,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 but then when they were using it for the performances at one night,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 it was exciting to see it in action.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 I just wanted to leave with one.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 I don't care if it's just raw breadboard or whatever.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 There's two of them in action.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 It was pretty sweet.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 It's hard to describe, I guess,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 a video module

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 by talking about it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 I haven't seen anything else like that in the video synthesis

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 world.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 I think it's going to change the game.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Three years we've been watching it develop every knob con.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 This was the closest version

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 to being a complete product I think that we've ever seen.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 You've shown off all the randomization features and all that stuff.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 It was pretty cool.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 What did they say for release?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Did they say like fall?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 It's something that could be a bit better.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 It's supposed to be this month,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 but I haven't seen anything saying it's coming soon.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 It might be looking at winter release.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 I think it is a small company.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 It's not surprising that they may not have the most robust

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 manufacturing process.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Eroginous tomes.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 That is how it is.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 I don't think we mentioned who's doing it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 I think we may have mentioned it in the past because every time we come back

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 from knob con, I think they are included in our best of because it's always very exciting.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 There's a lot of video stuff in general this year.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Actually, we got a presentation from Lars from LXR or not.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 That was the exit.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Very informative.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Yeah, that was great.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 It was a packed house.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Yeah, cleared up a lot of stuff for me about video synthesis.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 It was very informative and presented it kind of simply with examples.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Yeah, it was a really good highlight of the trip for sure.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Yeah, I think if you were to do more in the future, you know,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 and dip into more advanced stuff, I think people would attend.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 He seemed to be surprised that there were so many people there.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Yeah, and you know, and there was a lot of people that had more advanced questions

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 that I don't think he was counting on.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Right.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 It was meant to be like a real 101 type of class and people were hungry for more.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 But aside from that, yeah, I can't root.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 There isn't anything that sticks out in my head about this knob con.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 One thing that kind of sticks out for me and it was more after knob con that I got more into it was that

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 512 sequencer by the guy who makes the numerology software.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 It's like 32 or something HP, like 8 knob sequencer with a bunch of like buttons below it,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 a bunch of inputs and outputs.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 I think I missed that.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Yeah, it looks like really, it was kind of the booth like two booths over from where Ross was.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Okay.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 But yeah, it looks like super full feature.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 It looks like he's trying to share code between the numerology app and the sequencer and have a lot of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 interesting, probabilistic and algorithmic functions to it in the way you could do stuff with steps

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 that I haven't seen much outside of software or something like a circle on, which is much more expensive

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 and hard to get.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 It's interesting, but I'm also not really wanting to dive into a new sequencer right now.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 How many tracks was it?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 I think it was 8.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 But it also had a cool mode where you could able to style step through clips in a session view.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 So it was built for also playback of the sequences that you make.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Kind of like carbon?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Yeah, very similar to that.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Now was this real?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 I mean, is this something that was out and available or is it like prototype?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 He's been working on it for a while.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 It used to be like a prototype with like a wood panel and this one he had looked finished.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 And he seems like, if you email him, he will tell you like sometimes he'll be like, "Oh, I have one

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 I can ship you, but he's not at like full like production release."

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Wow.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 It seems like it's kind of like an ER 301 thing with a hardware stable.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 It's just all about software now.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Oh, that's cool.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Yeah.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 But it looks impressive.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.440
 I think it's in comparison to some of the other URAC sequences I've used, it was a little

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.600
 more straightforward with complexity and not necessarily as abstracted away from like,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.000
 "Oh, I just want to do this note-based sequence and have a little keyboard on it," which is

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 one of my favorite things about the pyramid.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 It's just put like a just a little stupid keyboard on there that I can use to make sense

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 and notes.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 But, you know, it's pretty cool.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 I'll be tracking it for sure.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.480
 I mean, there were two things that I remember from NABCON.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.000
 The first was apparently there's a Stomper module.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Right?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 In the one-huh.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Yeah, that was mind-blowing.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.800
 It was very exciting.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.600
 The guy who had it was Superchill.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.760
 I don't even know if I got his name or his company.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.640
 I basically just, all I remember was Stomper module and one of them was OneU.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.000
 I had thought to go back and try to track one down or get one.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.760
 The other one was the Arduino Shield.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.760
 Oh, the Detroit Underground?

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.760
 Detroit Underground thing.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.180
 Again, I think we talked about this right after we left of like, "I'm not necessarily

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.280
 like, I don't think I'm going to go get one," but it's a really cool idea.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.280
 Yeah.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.720
 To have the analog logic stuff available, that was the twist really over just a straight

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.720
 Arduino Shield.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720
 Yeah.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.720
 Yeah.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.720
 So that was pretty cool.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.360
 But yeah, again, like I'm glad they got funded.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.360
 Yeah.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.240
 The Kickstarter was successful, but I'm not trying to.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.280
 I'm moving more and more away from one into like, program stuff to make a new things.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.480
 It's the Kickstarter over for that?

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.480
 I think so.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.640
 I didn't keep track of it.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.840
 Yeah, because we got the flyer for the Kickstarter, which was either happening or...

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.840
 I've just started it.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.840
 It had just started.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.840
 Two days in.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.840
 Yeah.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.920
 I mean, the only thing from now on, the other thing I was going to say was it was cool to

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.800
 see the WMD sequencer with two of them, because we had seen it last year.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.800
 That weird gate seat.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800
 Right.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800
 I forgot about that.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.800
 Yeah.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800
 And we had seen it with just one of them, and it was pretty cool.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.280
 And they were like, "Oh, you can change them.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.440
 There could be two of them."

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.880
 And this year they had two of them, and it was kind of cool to see them interacting and

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.200
 having like this monstrous fucking sequencer.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.240
 It seemed pretty cool.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.360
 And it seemed like it's got to be getting close to being finished.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.360
 What's it called?

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.360
 I think it's a metron.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.360
 I fucking...

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.360
 Meetron.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.360
 Meetron.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360
 I think it's a metron.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.240
 Yeah, it was pretty dope.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.760
 The two daisy chain was cool, and we got to see them perform live with that.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760
 Yeah.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760
 It was pretty nice.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.760
 But it seems like just one would also, you know, be pretty good.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.680
 Oh, there was a lot of functionality in just one, but yeah.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.320
 Four tracks, I think.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320
 Maybe it was more...

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.720
 I think there's more than that.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.920
 There's four rows with surfaced on the actual hardware as four, but I think there was a

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.880
 way to get more than that out of it.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.880
 Yeah, I like that.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.880
 I forgot all about it, though.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.680
 I don't know why.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.600
 Yeah, that was the thing that like he gave a pretty in-depth presentation for us, and

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.400
 then while he was performing live, I was trying to keep an eye on, you know, how he was hitting

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.360
 the sequencer and calling things up.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.360
 It was pretty cool.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.360
 Yeah.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.360
 Yeah.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.360
 WMD.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.360
 Once again.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.360
 Once again.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.360
 No sign of...

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360
 [laughter]

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.360
 Shit.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.360
 What's it called?

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.360
 Gamma Wave.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.360
 Two, though.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.360
 It's really hoping to see one.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360
 Yes, it will.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.360
 See the glimpse.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.360
 Same hair.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.360
 It's back in the void.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.880
 It was there like twice in prototype form, right?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880
 And then, "boof."

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.880
 Yeah.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.880
 No words.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.880
 No ETA, nothing.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.200
 Yeah, it was almost more like...

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.720
 It was what was missing, it was what stood out from this knob con.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.720
 We all wanted...

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.920
 We had the Zadar infection at that point, so we wanted to see one of those in action.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.440
 There was nothing like that there.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.800
 A few other things.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.440
 It was engineering.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.640
 There was no noise engineering there, really.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.240
 Yeah, there was no Erika Synths present, no noise engineering, no Zadar.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.720
 A group of the things that were drawn are like top list, weren't there?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.720
 Yep.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.720
 That concludes another knob con.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.720
 Yeah.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.720
 [laughter]

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.480
 Halloween has come and gone.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480
 It has.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.720
 What'd you guys go as?

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:24.280
 I went as a nerd at a house party in my house.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:29.760
 Where I sat here and played Call of Duty.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.280
 Yeah.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.480
 But I did have a craving for horror movie.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.760
 And I didn't have my hopes up because there's never anything good around Halloween in the

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.760
 theaters, like ever.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.760
 True.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.360
 It's always another like, Saw sequel or like paranormal activity shit, you know.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.960
 The nth version of some shitty franchise.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.800
 Some found footage bullshit or some haunted house shit.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.800
 I don't know.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:06.600
 So, I didn't have my hopes up but looked online and I guess Venom has done so horribly that

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.800
 the IMAX took it out and put in the new Halloween movie.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.000
 Which I didn't even know existed.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.120
 So that got me pretty stoked.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.760
 It was fantastic.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.360
 It's a direct sequel to the original Halloween.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.480
 So carpenters heavily evolved again.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.560
 Not only with the direction but the soundtrack.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.560
 Nice.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:34.160
 And so it's him and his son, I think it's Cody carpenter, did the score.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.440
 And just hearing that, you know, the original Halloween theme and everything else that they

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.840
 did through the IMAX sound system, it was pretty good.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.280
 It's very old school.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:49.080
 It was like when you get a craving for a food, but you're not sure what that food is.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:55.560
 And you just go to a random restaurant and you end up like sleeping completely satisfied.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.400
 That was my Halloween film experience.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.760
 Great soundtrack, old school.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:06.440
 They kept it gory and just, you know, it wasn't ridiculous.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.440
 Jump scared bullshit.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440
 Right, right.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:13.120
 It's just Michael Beyer's walking around town, slaughtering people for two hours and then

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120
 it's a wrap.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.120
 So that's exactly what I needed.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.120
 As it should be.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.120
 Around Halloween.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.120
 Yeah.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.880
 Still got the music in my head.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.680
 It was like, it wasn't like over done.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.680
 You know what I mean?

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.240
 Like it was the Halloween theme, but a little bit like modernized and they used it sparingly.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.480
 You know, there was just some nice like drone work here and there to make tension.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.520
 So thumbs up the carpenter.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.760
 The carpenter is like this.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.760
 Not the band the carpenter.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.480
 No, not the band the carpenters, but the John and Cody, gotcha.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.120
 Father and son, keeping it real.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.120
 I'm glad to hear that.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.320
 I want to check it out at some point.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.640
 My friends do do the, I do a horror movie podcast just recently did Halloween H20.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.320
 Oh geez.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.600
 That was actually the last Halloween that I've seen, which is why I wasn't too hopeful

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.600
 for this one.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.600
 Yeah, they tore it apart.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.680
 And the one thing though that I remember, I mean, there's there's a litany of problems

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680
 that they listed with it.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.960
 But the one that I had not really thought about before was I don't want to jump scared

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.240
 in my Halloween movie.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.240
 Right.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.680
 What's terrifying is his slow relentless pursuit.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680
 Yes.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.680
 Like he's going to get you.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.240
 And if it's not now, he'll get you later.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.240
 Yes.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.920
 Like you are, you haven't escaped him, but like I don't want like him running someone

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:26.920
 down.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.920
 It's just he shows up when you least expect it and you think you've gotten away and

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.080
 then you turn the corner, you open up a door and there he is and then you're dead.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.080
 There he is.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.040
 I vaguely remember H20 except that Curtis was in that one again.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.040
 Yeah.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.360
 She wasn't really like true to her character.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.320
 I mean, it was it was her and her character, but like it had made a horrible, horrible

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.320
 turn.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.560
 She was in this one, this new one.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.000
 Oh, again, which I forgot to mention and she's fucking badass, dude.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 That's cool.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.400
 She plays old grandma.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.440
 Like she's she's worried about her daughter who she apparently raised up to be completely

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.440
 paranoid her entire life of this boogie man, Michael Myers, who she thought didn't exist.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.480
 So they all think, you know, my mom's crazy and then she has a daughter and she tries

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.520
 to like raise her granddaughter the same way her mom won't let her near her and she's

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.520
 like, you know, keep your loony tune shit away from my daughter and blah, blah, blah.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.520
 You know what I mean?

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:28.280
 So she's just like this crazy grandma who has this fortified shack in the woods with

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.840
 all these stock-powered weaponry waiting for the day that Michael Myers would be up for

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.040
 parole so that if he got out, she would slaughter him herself.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.200
 Like that was the whole plot.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.200
 Wow.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.200
 Yeah, it was it was awesome.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.200
 It was great.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.200
 It was good.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.280
 Also related kind of tangent.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:51.360
 I was in the bar in Seattle a couple days ago and caught like 10 minutes of cape fear

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.480
 and realized like, Holy shit, I got over your watch that movie as soon as possible.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.160
 So let's let's discuss this quickly because I know you ordered one, Dave.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.800
 I don't know if you got one yet.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.360
 I didn't order it, but the two HP cat.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.880
 No, I did not.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.880
 I did not order it.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.880
 He didn't know.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.280
 I thought for sure you would get that.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.120
 No, I was in it was in the cart.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.200
 I got like like I'm like, I'm ready to do this.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.320
 Like did the full on like whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.640
 Is there any chance you're going to use this after the first day that you get it?

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.040
 And they even try to talk myself into them like, okay, no, well, I mean, it's a good

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.040
 noise source.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.920
 Like I did the full like I there was a part of my brain.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.840
 It was like, you want to get this module.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.960
 And then the other part of my brain is going like, dude, no, no, I did not get it.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960
 I'm impressed.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.960
 You resisted.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.360
 I thought for sure you'd have like three of them.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.360
 Thank you.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.360
 And it was it was an internal struggle.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.480
 Like as I'm watching the video of it, like I'm just sitting there and I'm like, I'm just

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.880
 like grinning from air to ear.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.760
 I'm like, this is the most delightful thing I've ever fucking seen.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.560
 And then when they send like a little like sequence to it, so it's like a little singing

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.080
 cat, I'm like, Oh, you fuckers.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.240
 You fuckers.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.440
 This is just full on manipulation.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.320
 Yes, one of those things where I'm like happy that exists.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.640
 Yeah, but I don't have any room.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.640
 Need for it.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640
 Right.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.080
 I mean, just anything with like lighthearted that isn't super serious.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.680
 I think maybe there is a room for that type of stuff.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.600
 Yeah, even just the day I saw it, I remember I was just having like a rough day and I saw

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.120
 it and like that is one thing that is not awful and terrible.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.120
 Thank you.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.120
 Thank you universe.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.120
 That is one thing.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.800
 What do you speaking a little of?

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.800
 No, I'm caught.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.280
 I bet this is on your list.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.800
 You think about that nebulae too, because you got one of those and I'm kind of curious

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.040
 to see where you sit with it.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.560
 I didn't put it on my list because I actually haven't been diving too far into it.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.800
 I'm not.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:41.960
 But with what I have done with it so far, I like it, but I'm also waiting for the new

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.400
 firmware to come out, which they've been teasing for a couple of weeks now.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.400
 I see.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.920
 Because there's a couple of things I could complain about.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.560
 But the one thing that I guess is what everyone's complaining about the most is the fact that

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.560
 you can't render the buffer to the card.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.560
 Oh, I see.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.560
 So like you can't save whatever you record.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.480
 Right.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.480
 That's kind of strange.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:10.720
 You're either using source material from the card or you're using stuff in the buffer.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.760
 You can't really take one and put it to the other.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.600
 Does the like the morphogen do that?

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.160
 Will it kind of record itself?

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.160
 Yes.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.160
 You can record a morphogen.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.240
 If I recall correctly, yeah, you can save whatever you have going on there and you can

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.720
 continuously like re-sample shit with the morphogen.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.040
 But they've been saying with the new firmware that's something they want to implement.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.680
 It's just it wasn't there yet.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.320
 And they were looking for suggestions also for this next firmware.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:49.800
 The suggestion I proposed to them was that the file button not just be like linear.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:55.360
 Like right now, whatever you have on the card, you can change from file to file by hitting

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.720
 the file button or hitting it with a trigger.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.160
 I said it would be cool if there was a mode where it could be like randomized.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.160
 Like anytime you hit the file button with a gate, it would randomly select a file from

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.160
 the card.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.320
 Or like you could CV it.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.160
 So at this voltage, it would play this file.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.160
 Yeah.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.160
 It would play this file.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.160
 Right.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.160
 Yeah.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.160
 I don't know because I mean it just receives a gate.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.480
 So I don't know if there's any way they could make it scale like that.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.960
 Like if it reads like, you know, I don't know between one to five old or something like

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.960
 that.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.960
 I don't know.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.000
 But that was something I thought would be cool.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.800
 It would be basically break core in a module.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.800
 Yeah.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:33.480
 You know, I mean, you just load it up with your pre-sliced pre, you know, tempo breaks

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480
 or whatever.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.960
 And then you can just start bouncing between them and manipulating.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.040
 It would be a lot of fun, I think.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.040
 So when you hit file, does it start?

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.040
 File number one.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.000
 And then it goes file number two.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.520
 And they start from the beginning as they play.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:53.880
 I mean, is there is there no, I think it'll still play the last like file that got played

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.640
 until it receives a new like play trigger.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.640
 Gotcha.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.640
 So you can like switch files until you hit play again.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.680
 I don't remember off the top of my head.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.080
 Me personally, I haven't even been using it as a sampler at the moment.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.280
 Like I haven't even put anything new on the card.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.760
 I've been using it more in real time as a buffer manipulator kind of like clouds.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.760
 Yeah.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.760
 Yeah.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.360
 That's essentially what I've been doing is making it like clouds, you know what I mean?

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.920
 Like recording stuff into it, bouncing between wet and dry and fucking with the grains and

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.920
 all that.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:30.160
 I've even been running it into clouds for like dual, you know, mangling.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.800
 As a cloud substitute, how does how's that hold up?

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.000
 I think it would hold up.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Yeah.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.520
 As a substitute for clouds, but at the same time, I don't know, clouds has its alternative

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.720
 modes, which, yeah, although some people don't like I've always enjoyed more and I think

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.600
 that's why it makes clouds shine.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.600
 Yep.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.600
 You know what I mean?

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600
 You get all that extra versatility in it.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600
 Yeah.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.160
 Yeah, I don't know if I had to pick one or the other.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.160
 I don't know what I picked.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.280
 That'd be a tough choice between clouds and Nebula, but I think they go hand in hand pretty

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.280
 well.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.280
 Yeah.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.280
 So I haven't had a chance to dive too deeply in the Nebula, but I'm looking forward to,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.760
 you know, diving deeper, especially when the new farm work comes out.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.440
 What do you planning to put on the card?

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.040
 Have you ever got to use it?

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:19.600
 Well, I'd like to record stuff right from the modular on the, you know what I mean?

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.600
 Yeah.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.600
 I'd like to do a good rhythm going on the modular, be able to record it in there and

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.400
 bounce the buffer to the cards that I have, like, you know, eight chunks recorded of that

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.760
 rhythm that I can then manipulate and randomize and play back.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.280
 So you're thinking of it as like another buffer almost.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.520
 Like you've got the memory buffer, but then you also have what you're writing to the

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.200
 card that you can fuck with.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200
 Yep.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.200
 Yeah.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.200
 Exactly.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.200
 It seems like you do some really interesting layering.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.200
 Exactly.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.200
 Yeah.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.840
 So, sequence and all of a sudden, you know, you have something way more complex and layered.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.800
 That's what I'm looking forward to doing.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.840
 Making shit complicated.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.200
 Enough about me.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.320
 Let's discuss something that we've all had at hand in.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.320
 Yeah.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.520
 Wait, we've all had a hand in as far as using it.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.800
 To be clear, we did not make this.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.160
 Zadar, or as DIVKID pronounced it, Zadar.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:19.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.160
 I'm not sure what's just the proper pronunciation, but I'm sticking with Zadar.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.160
 Sticking with Zadar.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.160
 I like saying Zadar better.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.160
 It sounds more like sci-fi.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.160
 Okay.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.160
 I guess the better way to put this is, does anyone have a single bad thing to say about

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.160
 it?

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.160
 Let's just start with that.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.800
 Because like, I don't.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.720
 And I've seriously thought about getting a second one.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.720
 Yeah.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.880
 It's one of my favorite ever.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.880
 Love it for envelopes.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.040
 Kind of changed my system around.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.080
 I got that SSF muton.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.880
 Especially because it's going to pair up with that so well.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.160
 And the fact that it has that output attenuator means that I don't need some input attenuator

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.520
 for the CV on the muton.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.800
 I can just handle it there.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.600
 And I was like, oh, that's what kind of sold it for me.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.600
 Yeah.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.960
 The shapes and the modulation and the way you can say presets.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.440
 It's just so well thought out.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.360
 And single click for the analog to digital mode.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.880
 Just fucking brilliant.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.320
 They really killed it.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.040
 I have one minor complaint.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.280
 I'm a pessimist, Dave.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.520
 I was always fine.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.360
 It's a problem.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.240
 I even came to the table and was like, you know what?

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.240
 I love the sync.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.240
 I got no complaints.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.240
 Don't get me wrong.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.240
 I love it.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.120
 I just think that so they have four knobs, right?

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.160
 Each of which you can push and get a secondary function out of it.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.160
 Yep.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.080
 Except for the one.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.960
 The voltage knob, I believe, right?

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.960
 So.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.960
 Really?

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960
 Yeah.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960
 Think you're right.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.120
 It will go faster if you push it in.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:39.960
 Yeah.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960
 Like there's another mode.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960
 Great.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.880
 I was thinking it would be nice that if you push that button, it would toggle on the

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.560
 loop, on and off.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.760
 That would be great.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.320
 It heals me to agree with you, but that's a brilliant idea.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.800
 Thank you.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.120
 It's a great option and it's the one thing that you have to kind of dive into the menu

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.280
 to enable.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.600
 Everything else, like I've barely gone into that menu.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.560
 One thing that I haven't, I've seen a few videos of people using it as an oscillator

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.360
 that were fucking incredible and I haven't tried that yet too much.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.440
 I've used it as like looping LFO but not an audio rate.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.600
 The one video I heard was like ridiculous.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.040
 I didn't, I thought it was a good noise engineering oscillator or something like that.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.040
 It was so like odd.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.040
 Yeah.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.680
 Another shout out to the DIVKit.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.320
 He did a video with it as like a quad oscillator and that was really damn cool.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.960
 And he had like one channel as an oscillator and the other channel like, you know, CV-ing

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.920
 it while it was being awesome.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.920
 You know what I mean?

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.920
 I was like, yeah.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.520
 This is what I'm talking about right there.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.520
 Yeah.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.240
 I mean, it's a hell of a module.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.440
 So much functionality crammed into what is that?

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.960
 Eight, 10, 12.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.960
 I have to think 12.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.960
 Is that 12?

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.960
 Okay.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.960
 Yeah.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.960
 It's 12.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.960
 Four channels.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.960
 You think it's 10?

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.960
 Think of it as how many four HP in there.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.360
 I don't think you could do three.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.760
 Yeah, I think that's 10.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.760
 All right, maybe it's 10.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:07.560
 But I like two that's like, I looked at the manual one time to look at some function

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.560
 I didn't know about.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.280
 You could easily traverse it with no issues.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.280
 Yeah.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.280
 And it sounds good.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.240
 Like it's, I don't, I got that and was like, I don't know why would I want an analog

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.640
 envelope again?

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.440
 Like I'm, I don't know.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.840
 Because it gets super tight in the way you can switch the modes.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.440
 Like, I don't see any reason to have them anymore.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.920
 I think because of that.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.920
 10 HP.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.920
 10 HP.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.920
 All right.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.920
 Fine.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.920
 You're right.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.920
 Hope you're fucking happy with yourself.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.920
 I am.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.920
 Good fucking job.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.280
 I've been with my envelopes since getting it.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.080
 And I'm definitely thinking of just slapping a second one in there.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.080
 Yeah.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.080
 Same air.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.560
 That'll probably handle all of my envelope duties.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.560
 Yeah.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.560
 I mean, even, I even got rid of the quadra.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.400
 I mean, because the only thing that was different, it was it had the, it could, you

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.120
 know, it could take a gate and hold.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.120
 Mm hmm.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.120
 Really the only thing that was different between.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.120
 I see.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:02.040
 That the, the Zadar doesn't have and, and it's so easy to dial in what I want it to do.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.720
 By just all the shape, all of the shaping functions are like, well, this is actually

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.560
 easier than trying to figure out how long to have that fucking gate open in order to

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.920
 get the envelope that I want.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.800
 Why don't I just put it on this fucking, like I can just do it in that much easier.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.800
 Yeah.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.360
 There was some people complaining in the muff thread for it.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360
 Yeah.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.480
 Like, you know, they wanted hold and I wanted all these other like basic analog envelope

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.480
 function on it.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.480
 That's the classic function of like from the sixties.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.600
 And I love their response was like, that's cool.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.120
 That's what Dave fucking did in the sixties.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.120
 This is what I'm trying now.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.120
 Yeah.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.120
 I mean, those exist.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.120
 Yeah.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.120
 Exactly.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.560
 If you want that, there's plenty of choices on there for that.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.120
 If you want something a little different, something a little, you know, off the rails,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.800
 there's, there's Zadar for me to open up the ornament and crime even more.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.960
 Because I was using that as more of a modulator.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.960
 And now I don't.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.680
 It's more, how can I make that thing fuck up the Zadar?

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.680
 Yeah.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.520
 There's one piece that I have where it's like you hit it with a gate and it wobbles like

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.120
 fucking jello, you know, and like slows down with the gravity in that, um, I forget what

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.120
 it's called.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.720
 And one where it simulates gravity and the bouncing ball type thing.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.720
 The wall of the circle, like the circles on the screen.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.720
 Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.600
 It's the one that literally you see it drop down.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.600
 Yeah.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.600
 You get four channels of that.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.640
 Those two are fucking, it's, it's usually in that mode now just to throw that kind of

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.560
 gravity type shit at it from a CV perspective.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.880
 Ah, getting crazy sounds out of that.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.080
 That sounds awesome.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.080
 Such a good design.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.160
 Like they really just fucking smashed it.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.160
 Yeah, they nailed it.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:33.440
 And it's pretty much what I would expect from a weird envelope in the year 2018.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.440
 Yeah, exactly.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:39.760
 And it seems like none of us had problem ones, but, um, based on that muff thread, people

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.400
 that are having problems are having them addressed immediately.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.400
 Yeah.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.400
 It seems seems like a hardware.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.400
 Yeah.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.640
 Type thing more than software, which I think was our concern where it's like, yeah, if

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.800
 it crashed ever, that would be disappointing.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.640
 But just some hardware glitch.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.640
 Then fuck it.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.920
 Who suggested in the email thread about the Mordak's data?

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.720
 I think that was usually.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.720
 Yeah.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.720
 Yeah.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:09.320
 That put a little worm in my ear about it because now I'm looking at those and I'm like, oh,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.520
 yeah, that would be sweet to be able to see like all four channels in real time.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.520
 I'd love to see this.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.360
 I mean, the screen does a good job of showing you what you're messing with currently, but

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.000
 the, the, and it was, I think it was from the dev kid video is right for us all.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 Yeah.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.880
 And I was like, and each screen is fine.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.400
 Like I, I go to A and like, okay, I get a sensible A is doing.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.080
 I go to B and also seeing them all in real time and all this, um, that would be incredible

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.080
 to have.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.720
 Well, that turned out to be not controversial.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:40.560
 Do we have, do we have anything that's controversial where we're going to like fight?

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.800
 We're going to have like a good screaming match.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.000
 Hmm.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.560
 I want more racist modules.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.560
 I don't.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.560
 I'm glad you can verify that.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.560
 Yeah.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.600
 I mean, the only thing I have is a visual cortex.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.600
 Oh, fuck.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.600
 Yeah, you got that.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.400
 Yeah, I don't, I don't really know how much to say because as we went up before, radio

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.320
 and podcasting is not a visual medium.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:10.480
 Um, all I could say though is, uh, I, I'm getting a ton of shit out of it.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.480
 Just it.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.200
 Because one of the things I was a little worried about is not having a ton of, um, their modules

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.680
 or the modules that are specifically designed for video.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:24.000
 Um, but it turns out the, the, the one real limitation is you need to have something that

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.160
 goes above 30 K and it turns out the Dixie does.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.800
 So I have one that can go above well into that to the supersonic range.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:36.680
 Um, and then any of the other oscillators that I have handle the other dimension.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.680
 There's a, there are a couple of things that I would like to get.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.000
 That's what I was going to wonder.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 Like what is it?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.880
 What are the gaps you want to fill in now?

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.240
 The, the main gap that I want to fill in is what the staircase does, which multiplies and

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.240
 divides.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.680
 I send it a frequency and it does, um, multiplications and divisions.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.240
 But honestly, I think that's it.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.920
 Everything else I, I, I have with existing audio modules.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:02.680
 Now to step back for a minute for our listeners, this is the LZX, which one is it again?

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.680
 The name exactly.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680
 This is the visual cortex.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.680
 Visual cortex.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.720
 So it was like the out of stock forever.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.720
 Yeah.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.720
 Nobody could get it.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.040
 And it's kind of a basic, like what is it?

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.240
 Like starter system for video synthesis really.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.240
 Yeah.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.280
 It's basically they're like basic primitive toolkit in one module.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.760
 And it's, um, it's big.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.800
 It's a big honkin thing.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.280
 But what it allows you to get is video input.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:28.480
 So you can, it turns it, um, these different video signals, anti usable signal within itself

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.640
 has a ramp generator.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.400
 It has, um, different ways in order to do the sync generation.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:41.080
 Um, and then it has a mixer for the different like animation, uh, and key generators and

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.080
 all of its module level, all of it takes a lot of stuff from existing audio modules.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.200
 So I can do animations with LFOs.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.640
 You can do pretty much everything with just that and an audio system.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:58.800
 And especially if you're seeing Laura's talk on, uh, at knob con, filled in a couple

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.360
 of the blanks that I was having as far as like, how am I using this audio signal to

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.360
 generate video?

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.840
 Um, I think his talk was great.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.560
 And then they also have a series of videos on YouTube on their YouTube channel that is

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.560
 perfect explanations.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:18.160
 It's kind of funny cause Lars, even during his talk said like, you know, he purposely

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:26.160
 worded things to not be a commercial, but it, it ultimately like definitely, uh, sold

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.000
 you and I'm sure many others in there on his stuff.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.480
 So yeah, I mean, it was kind of cool.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.080
 I mean, I was already halfway there.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.920
 Like, this is something I've been looking at for a long time and had been interested

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.920
 in.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.360
 Yeah, that's all I have for that.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.360
 That aside.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:45.160
 Again, this would probably be a lot more interesting if this wasn't entirely audio medium.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.320
 True.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:55.000
 So I did go against, as I mentioned, my, uh, no spending in October plan got the noise

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.240
 engineering, uh, adoraxic.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.240
 It's here at us.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.440
 We're looking at it right now.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.440
 Holy shit.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.240
 I did not realize how many cables you have plugged into it.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.240
 It's good.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.080
 It kind of likes to be modulated.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.360
 It's getting worked over.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:17.040
 So yeah, it's the big brother to the adoraxic, uh, what's it called?

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.040
 Trans-Litron?

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040
 I believe it was.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.040
 Yeah.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.280
 Trans-Litron.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.040
 Which is like chippy Atari style.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.040
 Yeah.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.000
 You know, I do wish it still had that digital readout screen that would be nice for the

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.160
 waveforms.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.960
 But, uh, yeah, it's pretty nifty.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:41.400
 Um, I've only had it for about two days now because I bought it during the perfect circuit,

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.240
 Halloween sale.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.320
 And then it took FedEx like two weeks to ship it to me for some reason.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.640
 I was supposed to have it last Saturday and then just kept getting delayed and delayed.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:57.080
 But, uh, yeah, now that I have it, I tried to dive into it, um, on Friday night and last

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.120
 night, it's nifty.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.200
 It's, it's not like percussion based, you know what I mean?

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.760
 Like the BIA or anything like doesn't have an onboard envelope or VCA.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.240
 Is there any way we can get a sample of this?

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.240
 Cause I'm...

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.240
 Listen to this.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:32.040
 [

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:37.480
 So, uh, one of the things that caught my attention when I first saw it was the, uh, the comb

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.480
 filter.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.480
 Yeah.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.480
 So how, uh, it's pretty cool.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.480
 It's pretty cool.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.480
 [laughter]

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.120
 It's, it's like, uh, yeah, I don't know.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.280
 Like I haven't had a chance to dive too far and it's not like very resonant or anything,

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.280
 you know what I mean?

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280
 But it's cool.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.240
 Cause I don't know, I've been using it for the last two days to generate like high-pitched

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.240
 percussion stuff.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.240
 You know what I mean?

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:04.320
 I keep running it through VCA and things like that using it like a snare and, uh, comb filter

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:09.160
 helps to like bring out those upper harmonics and, you know, suppress the lowers and stuff

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.160
 like that.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.600
 It's a neat feature to have on there and it's definitely fun to CV have it do crazy stuff.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600
 Yeah.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.440
 But, uh, so is that what you imagine you're using it mostly for percussion?

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.440
 Yeah.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.960
 Cause that's what I used to use the, uh, little guy for, you know, the, the old Hatteraxi.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.320
 I, I had that primarily as like a noisy chip toony snare.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.320
 You know what I mean?

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.160
 I almost always had it patched up like that.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.560
 This is now like a more interesting version of that.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:40.200
 So I can definitely see using it in a percussive, percussive way also.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.200
 Cool.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:49.100
 It's got the three modes, you know, three algorithms which see Vable into three, um,

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.200
 octave ranges similar to the BIA.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.200
 Also see Vable.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.400
 It's pretty cool.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.960
 Um, only thing I don't like about it is once again, like a lot of the newer noise engineering

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.920
 stuff, the, the pitch is a endless encoder.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.920
 I know.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.360
 You know, I'm not a huge fan of that.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.440
 And I get the reasons for doing it.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.320
 But again, it's just not for me.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.480
 It's hard to dial in sweet spots on the pitch like that.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.480
 Yeah.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.480
 Yeah.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.040
 But overall I think noise engineering got another, another winner here.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.520
 Mm hmm.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:28.800
 It's definitely, uh, the sounds that come out of it are unlike, you know, much else that

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.720
 I can think of off the top of my head.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.920
 It's pretty unique, pretty glitchy.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.840
 It's advertised as an over the top glitch oscillator.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.560
 And uh, I think I would agree with that.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.560
 That sounds very appealing.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.560
 Mm hmm.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.560
 It's interesting.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.560
 It's fun.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.480
 And it's crammed into a pretty small pet.
