00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.800
 We've had an interesting variation on what everyone's drinking.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.680
 Not the same as we usually do.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.840
 I have blueberry green tea, and I'm following that up

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.680
 with Trader Joe's sparkling blueberry lemonade water.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.960
 Blueberry kick.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.440
 Yeah.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.920
 Wow.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.760
 Where'd you get the green tea from?

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.160
 Also Trader Joe's, yes.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.160
 Conversely, I lived like a week ago.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.120
 I got bold and tried a blueberry cider from Nockin Noggin,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.640
 or that's the name of it.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.920
 I don't know what it was.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.080
 All I know is it was one of the worst things

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.480
 I've ever tasted in my entire life.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.720
 And I did the full on, like, to my partner.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.080
 I'm like, oh, here, this is terrible.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.520
 You got to try this.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.600
 And to her credit, she gave it a shot and was--

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.200
 and like, winced, like, fizzily winced.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.800
 Do you just not like blueberry, or was it just--

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.200
 was it implemented poorly?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.840
 I love blueberry.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.400
 That's why I gave it a shot.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.600
 I don't know what they did do it.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.800
 It was a calamity.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.120
 It had some element of blueberry in it.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.760
 Like, it wasn't like it was just deviated from blueberry too

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.480
 far.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.440
 It had all these other spice, like, non-complimentary spices

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.160
 and crap in it.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.840
 And it had-- yeah, like, you drink something

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.720
 and it'll have, like, you got your initial flavor,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.280
 then there's, like, the aftertaste.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.560
 This was a roller coaster afterwards.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.440
 It was-- like, it had an aftertaste,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.040
 and then, like, it kind of faded out,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.800
 and then it came back in, and then it was strong.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.840
 It was-- yeah, it was a good, like, three or four-minute adventure

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.480
 just after you finished that first set.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.880
 Sounds horrible.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.080
 Yeah, I feel like there's not much that complements blueberry

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.840
 well, except more blueberry.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 Yeah.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.160
 That might have been where they screwed up.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.840
 It was trying to, like, add something.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.400
 If it was just a, like, a more simple formula,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.640
 it might have worked better.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.520
 I've been eating a lot of blueberries in my breakfast, too,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.280
 and there's just not much you can mix with it, you know what I mean?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.200
 Like, if I dice up an apple or a banana,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.800
 you know, I could put peanut butter with banana or cinnamon

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.400
 and almonds with apple, whatever the fuck, like, blueberry.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.400
 It's, like, just blueberry.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.720
 Like, anything else is just kind of--

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.840
 comes nasty.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.760
 It's good stuff.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.280
 I in antioxidants.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.600
 I could fuck with, like, blueberry on oatmeal.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.120
 Mm-hmm.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.640
 Yeah.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.600
 Like, you know, something that doesn't have much competing

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.520
 flavor.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.920
 This is now a breakfast podcast.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.200
 What are you drinking, Dave?

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.040
 I am just drinking coffee.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.200
 I'm drinking warm coffee.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.320
 I've switched over from--

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.400
 Whoa.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.360
 --iced coffee.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.160
 Yeah, where's the ice coffee, Dave?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.680
 Yeah, it's-- well, mainly because I didn't--

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.960
 it wasn't prepared ahead of time.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.800
 And so this is the pot that was made, like, an hour ago.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.640
 And I was like, OK, fuck it.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.160
 I'm just going to drink warm coffee.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.880
 It's delicious.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.520
 It's not as good as ice coffee.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.920
 But it is also the middle of winter,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.600
 so maybe compromises can be made.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.320
 It's delicious, though, from a big dog.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.280
 It's their blend.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.560
 Oh, nice.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.640
 What about you, Nick, what are you drinking?

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.840
 Drinking some black tea that I got.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.280
 This aged black tea.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.760
 It's really delicious.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.280
 From white to tea, it's this, like, Chinese tea importer.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.280
 And you can get, like, ridiculous teas from them,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.600
 and they're all really cheap.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.000
 It's amazing how much, like--

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.880
 everything I get, it's, like, 80 cents a day

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.600
 to drink, like, the best teas in the world.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.400
 Because it's just fucking cheap to get a big bulk tea, you know?

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.280
 Mm-hmm.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.200
 So it's delicious, though.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.440
 That requires brewing, though.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.640
 It does.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.600
 Yeah, I can't do that.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.360
 It means too much.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.720
 It's too much responsibility.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.080
 Different types of brewing, too.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.880
 You can do your Gong Fu style brewing,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.480
 which is just in a tiny pot for, like, a few seconds.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.400
 Or you can do the grandpa brewing,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.800
 which is what most people do, which is just throwing leaves

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.160
 in a pot for a while.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.280
 Which one do you do?

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.280
 It depends on the tea.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.680
 With this, I did it a little more grandpa,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.560
 because it's a black tea, and it's good like that.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.920
 But some things would be kind of nasty that way,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.040
 if they're a little strong or, like, aged or fermented a little.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.600
 Now, Earl Grey is a black tea, right?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.920
 You know, there's all tea that comes from, like, one leaf,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.160
 and it's just how oxidized it is that makes it, like,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
 a different kind of tea.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.760
 I like Earl Grey, and I fully admit

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.960
 that I started drinking it because of Jean-Luc Picard.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.760
 I was just going to say, because I saw it right.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.760
 Yeah, 100%.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.240
 100% hot.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.760
 And that is what I say every time I make it.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.440
 Yeah, I think it's just a black tea with Bergamot.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.360
 And that's pretty much what an Earl Grey is.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.840
 I like Earl Grey, too.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.400
 I'm similarly, though, like, every time I try to get into tea,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.280
 or, like, oh, I should drink more of that

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.880
 instead of just coffee all the time.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.520
 I'm just too lazy.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.600
 That's the only reason why I'm getting back into tea,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.040
 because Trader Joe's already has a brood and flavored,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.040
 and it's in a bottle, like, convenient.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.200
 It was actually Shawn Dementia that got me back into tea.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200
 A little bit.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.200
 Yeah.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.200
 Oh, nice.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.360
 I'm just trying to introduce caffeine back into my diet

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.960
 after not having any for, like, six, seven years now.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960
 Yeah.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.200
 So I figured this green tea was a nice way to ease back into that.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.880
 There's something about the idea of not having a near constant IV

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.200
 drip of caffeine in your life that is in the comprehensible to me.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.360
 It is for me as well.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.800
 Like, you know how dependent on it.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.440
 I was when I drank it.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.440
 You know what I mean?

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.320
 But I eliminated it to try and help with my insomnia and my anxiety attacks, but honestly,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.400
 cutting it out over the last few years hasn't really made any fucking difference.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.920
 So I'm also going to keep drinking caffeine and get the productivity boost.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.160
 I could definitely use that from time to time.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.760
 It just gets me back to zero.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.760
 Yeah.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.760
 Right, right.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.760
 Yeah.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.760
 Balance is yelled.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.760
 Yeah.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.760
 I don't know, actually.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.920
 It's so long since I even bothered to try to quit.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.680
 Coffee used to make me extremely jittery, but, uh, and like, you know, sweaty palms and

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.160
 like anxiety and shit like that.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.440
 But at the same time, it also made me able to actually focus on things like, I think

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.200
 most of the music that I made with Prometheus stuff was on lots of caffeine.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200
 You know what I mean?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.760
 I'd go down to the beehive, get a triple shot on ice, come back and start working on shit.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.960
 Like that was my routine.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.920
 Probably wouldn't have been able to do it without caffeine.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.920
 You know what I mean?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920
 It's like...

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.800
 That's what I like about tea is that, um, thionine chemical like balances the caffeine

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.600
 out and it's really hard to get jittery because I'll have like six like small pots of tea

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.600
 a day.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.280
 It's like way more than enough.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.680
 Um, but it never like fucks me up as much as like a quad shot will kind of.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.680
 Which I like.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.880
 I'd never, like you said, Dave, I never quit.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.360
 I can't imagine like quitting caffeine.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.640
 I just go between coffee and tea.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.640
 Sometimes both.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.800
 But I'm in a heavy, heavy tea phase.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.440
 It's been fun.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.040
 So it's the end of 2020 here.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.720
 Yeah, let's give some context here.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.040
 We are not socially distanced in my backyard.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.160
 We are back to recording remotely.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160
 Yup, yup.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.320
 Via Discord.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.000
 Cause people can't do the simple thing of putting on a fucking mask.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.080
 No being mildly responsible.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.080
 Impossible.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.240
 I feel like we've been like, I don't remember how like much we've torn into like anti-maskers

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.840
 and basically people making this problem a lot longer and shouldier than had to be.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.760
 I mean, no matter how much we've torn into them, I will say it's probably not enough.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760
 Never enough.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.560
 Fuck them.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.920
 And if there's someone who's listening and you know, getting pissed.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.920
 Good.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.200
 Now as good a time as any to hop off.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.200
 Yeah.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.200
 Please.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.200
 Your stop.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200
 Please.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.960
 We're using Discord and with cameras so we can see each other at least.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.960
 Yeah.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.960
 It's too nice.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.440
 We'll at least see each other this time around, you know.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:23.480
 That was a setback I think with the other ones we did via Discord where we didn't have

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.480
 cams.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.160
 It's hard to read each other's feelings on shit as we discussed it.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160
 Right.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.160
 Right.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.640
 After being used to all sitting at a table next to each other and bullshitting.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.640
 The true way.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.640
 Yeah.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.120
 At least we had one good get together this year.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.120
 Yeah.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.120
 Yeah, that was good.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.520
 A very cautious one, but it was fun nonetheless.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.280
 Well, it was around Halloween.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.680
 The only holiday we're celebrating.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.680
 True.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.760
 Well, that made a, but yeah.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.920
 So it was a good one.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.280
 It wasn't like we were like, we got together for Thanksgiving or some bullshit like that.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.040
 No colonizer shit.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.680
 Just a good Halloween.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.680
 Exactly.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680
 Yeah.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.680
 Why can't every day be Halloween?

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.680
 It bothers the song.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.680
 It just said.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.680
 Yeah.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.160
 Oh, oh, oh.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.760
 So this is the end of December.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.160
 We are recording this.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.920
 I don't actually know what date it is.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.920
 I don't either.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.920
 Anyone.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.400
 Oh, you know, I got stuck in a wormhole on the internet last night.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.800
 I had the bright idea of like, why don't I look at your Iraq Reddit and what pissed me

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.400
 off was holiday songs being played on modulars.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.720
 I listened to a few of them and I'm sorry, but it was upsetting to me.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.720
 I'm sorry, people.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.240
 You don't hear someone's rendition of jingle bells made on Lucas games?

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.000
 No, I don't.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 I don't.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Were they like, Ernest?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.360
 Were they like, like, I'm going to make a good holiday song and it was like what you

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.960
 might hear on like a Hallmark special.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.720
 They weren't terribly produced videos.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.240
 You know, I'm sorry.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.240
 I just don't like it.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.240
 I hate it.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.840
 But it wasn't like switched on holiday music or anything like that.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.600
 Like, like, sounded like super electronic.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.600
 Like it was like.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.600
 It was kind of like who.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.040
 Yeah, like it somehow had that quality to it.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.800
 That's just like, oh, that's kind of a shitty patch to, you know?

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.240
 I'm setting listeners.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.240
 It's okay.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.960
 Got to keep it real.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.920
 Yo, thanks to quarantine.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.560
 My exposure to shitty holiday music has been like absolutely nil.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.040
 Like, I think I heard, what the fuck was I?

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.800
 I was, I think it was like CVS.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.160
 I went up there to grab like some essentials and they had holiday music playing the other

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.160
 day.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.920
 And that's like my only exposure to it that I've had so far.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.320
 It's been pretty nice.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.280
 So who's got something that they want to kick it off with?

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.200
 Yeah, I was going to start with my 2020 roundup.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.200
 Yeah.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.880
 Like what I considered to be my top three picks of the year.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.880
 Oh.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880
 Top three.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880
 I can do a top three.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.880
 Can you do a top three Dave?

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.880
 Yeah, how about you Dave?

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.880
 You got three?

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.040
 I do have a top three.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.920
 But one thing I did want to say is maybe before we got into listing is we had mentioned

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:17.680
 at one point we were talking about over quarantine, doing DIY stuff and then not doing DIY stuff.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.040
 And I have a bold rash announcement.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.040
 You do.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.160
 I finished my Sonic Potions LXR.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.160
 Fuck yeah.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.560
 Let me borrow that shit.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.080
 Mostly now I'm pissed that I didn't do it earlier.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.080
 I told you you would be.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.080
 Yeah.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.080
 It's fucking awesome.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.840
 I knew you would dig it.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.440
 I regret selling mine like every day.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.240
 Oh yeah, this is this is already cold dead hands type of stuff.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.240
 I'm not.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.800
 I can't see getting rid of this.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.160
 And the build wasn't even that bad.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.200
 Like I think maybe I just had in my head like there's a lot of parts, but it was you know,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.200
 it was a weekend to do it and the IO expander.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.160
 And yeah, as soon as I started using it, I was like, what did you wait so fucking well?

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.720
 Even within quarantine, I should have just done that in like the second week.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720
 Like fuck it.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.200
 We're going to be here forever.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.200
 Yeah.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.880
 Then I got the Brennan Clark's alternative firmware.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.880
 What's that?

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.720
 Put it on it.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:19.160
 It's very similar to the 0.37 has a lot of similarities.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.680
 It's just a lot of it's a bunch of like little small quality of life improvements that are

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.600
 actually really fucking useful.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:34.200
 It's worth getting because it's free and you just put that bin file on your SD card and

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.160
 load it up dirt fucking civil.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.280
 But yeah, no, I've a I just want to mention that I actually finished something and I'm

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.280
 glad I did.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.280
 That's awesome.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.040
 B it was fucking amazing.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.320
 Like I'm fucking in love with this thing.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.760
 I love the LXR.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:54.520
 My biggest complaint with it was the lack of knobs and control over the parameters, you

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520
 know what I mean?

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:01.120
 I didn't have like a MIDI control or anything hooked up to it to help with that.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:07.480
 So I used it extensively on the MECA album and then I sold it and I've missed it ever

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.800
 since and every once in a while, like I'll see one pop up used and I'm like, ah, should

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800
 I get that?

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.000
 And then I saw that there's that whole 60 knobs from Bastol.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 Yeah.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.680
 And for that, I would have never sold it for sure.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.680
 Yeah.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.040
 That makes me kind of want to get one again.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.840
 I just don't want to fucking build one.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.320
 So I'm like trying to keep an eye if a nice looking one pops up at a reasonable price.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.760
 I would probably grab it again for sure.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.520
 It still ended up taking me a full weekend.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:39.360
 I mean, it was, you know, and that's you building it like you're compared to me fast,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.280
 you know, and skilled with a soldering iron like that would probably take me fucking weeks

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.040
 to do and I'd probably fuck it up multiple times.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.760
 Yeah, I remember when I got mine, I remember it was snowing years ago and I built just

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.760
 the stock kit.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.960
 It was a full like eight hours.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.760
 Like, I remember you saying it was like a full day.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760
 Yeah.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.760
 Yeah.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.240
 And then the expander came out a little later and that was like a couple hours or something

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.240
 like that.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.240
 Yeah.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.680
 I built the expander from mine and even that was like a full day for me.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680
 Fuck man.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.480
 I don't really want to know what it looks like.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.480
 They're good.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.560
 They sound like the quality of it too.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.080
 I just really like the high hats as you probably figured out.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.160
 It's like where the FM love is kind of.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160
 Yeah.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.040
 Okay, I'm glad other people agree with that because that was actually one of the things

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.840
 I was doing with it the most was making hats.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:35.880
 Like I have, you know, my electron cycles now, which to me gets me into semi-LXR territory

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.760
 that I was using it for, but the hats are kind of trash.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:47.280
 I just don't like the metal algorithm on air for hats and the other algorithms or I

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.520
 guess I shouldn't say algorithms, the other machines in there don't do hats as well as

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.720
 I like them.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720
 You know what I mean?

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.200
 Like the LXR like there was just some really nice crisp crunchy lo-fi hats that you can

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.400
 get out of it and you can do all the micro steps with it and do some nice rolls and shit.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.440
 I fucking loved it for that.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.480
 I think all the hats on the Mecha album came out of my LXR.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.720
 I think going through the Sherman filter bank for added distortion and shit like that.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.400
 I like the separate outs.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.800
 Like who sets a stereo pair as?

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.040
 Being able to just be like, okay here, you guys are going to be the clean ones and you're

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.960
 the one that I'm going to route into the modular and process.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:32.640
 Yeah, the bass drums on it though, kick drums are fucking fantastic on that thing.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.640
 It's...

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.640
 Yeah.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.640
 Sorry.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.640
 Zero complaints.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.640
 Zero complaints.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:47.720
 I struggle to think of a machine up until the rhythm that I was like so productive with.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720
 You know what I mean?

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.720
 Then the LXR.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.800
 Like I was just able to get a lot of mileage out of that.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.800
 Yeah.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.800
 I don't know.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.800
 I miss it for sure.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800
 I think I need to get one again.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.800
 Yeah.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.280
 Every time I find myself tempted by a machine drum again, I'm like, oh wait, why when there's

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.440
 LXRs out there and I can get instead.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.520
 I had a machine drum craving a couple weeks ago and realized like, hey, they're still

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.760
 now they're like a grand just for like a kind of shitty stock one.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.760
 Yeah.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.760
 It's just not...

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.320
 I saw the full blown one are going for like two grand now.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.640
 I was like, yeah, I was like, what?

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.880
 That's what happened.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.960
 I remember a couple years ago when they were going like back down to like 600 to 800 bucks

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.280
 and now suddenly they're like, I guess in flavor again, I don't know.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.520
 So 2020 is wrapping up quickly.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.520
 Thanks.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.120
 Oh, yeah, this will not be missed.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.680
 Before we get into our top lists, one of the things I was thinking was a lot of this

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.800
 stuff is like kind of border 2019.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:55.280
 Like 2020 didn't see a lot of new stuff overall.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.480
 Not a terrible amount of stuff.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.680
 Not at the rate we had been coming into this year with.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.680
 Right.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.040
 A lot of stuff did kind of trying to not unexpectedly given the circumstances.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.200
 I think that was an issue that was going to be an issue this year pandemic or not because

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.560
 I like went back and looked at like some of our previous episodes towards the end of the

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:21.520
 year like from knob con on from between knob con and name like there was nothing on the

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.680
 horizon that like any of us were like hyped up about with the exception of getting a hydro

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.680
 sense.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.680
 Right.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.680
 There was just like nothing.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.680
 You know what I mean?

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.240
 Like the supply chains were kind of fucked up before the pandemic and that kind of crushed

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.240
 them too.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.520
 So a lot of people can't even make modules right now on top of it being like we were talking

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.080
 about it being at the saturation point before.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.400
 Is it like, you know, where are you really going to go now?

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.000
 That's not something digital or something that's just, I don't know.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.120
 I think I think that over saturation is what has been pushing me into pedal territory because

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.600
 there's just some fresh ideas happening in pedals right now that is not really happening

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.840
 in modular format.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.760
 Like, you know what I mean?

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.720
 Like there's just a lot of the same thing being reproduced a hundred different ways right

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.000
 now in Euro rack.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.640
 Which is a shame because it used to be the opposite.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.640
 Right.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.720
 This used to be the frontier of like interesting stuff.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.560
 But I think, you know, that was 10 years ago.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:25.040
 Well, I think this why pedals are having some interesting things happen right now is because

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.720
 like they've been working on these ideas obviously for the last year or two trying to

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.880
 compete with modules, you know, trying to come up with something different.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.840
 And it seems like they're succeeding, you know, like there's a lot of interesting like

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.720
 microcosm is essentially like a clouds on steroids.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.720
 You know what I mean?

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.160
 Like it just seems to like play into that very specific sound that people were using

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.280
 clouds to generate and just focusing on that and blown it out.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.280
 You know what I mean?

00:18:52.280 --> 00:19:00.080
 So all these ways to achieve that faster and almost effortlessly it seems like on some

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.880
 of the demos that I'm seeing, you know what I mean?

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.760
 Like to get certain things like that out of clouds, it requires very specific types of

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.680
 modulation and you know what I mean?

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.680
 And sweet spots.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.560
 So I mean, do you think the fact that it's a pedal and you know, you're you need to shy

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:20.640
 away from having a lot of controls lends itself to that quickness of A to Z getting the sound

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.040
 that you want that maybe having the million options and a million inputs and outputs and

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.480
 modular ends up being a little bit of a detriment to, you know, what I just want to sound.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.480
 Exactly.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:37.320
 Like there was there was absolutely people who were buying clouds but didn't want to get

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.960
 that deeply into modular, you know what I mean?

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.240
 And like who were probably intimidated by all the CV functionality and trying to learn

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.880
 how to use clouds and things like that, they just saw a few demo videos and they're like,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.880
 I want that.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:55.120
 I want to run my guitar into that or my synth into that and get this sound that I hear in

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.200
 this demo.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:02.720
 And so they're you know, they would have to go out on a limb and jump into modular even

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.800
 if it's only, you know, dip in a toe to get that.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.800
 Now they don't have to.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.200
 Now here comes a pedal and they're like, Oh, great.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.200
 You know what I mean?

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.680
 Here comes microcosm which does all this.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.520
 I don't have to worry about CV.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:19.160
 You know, I don't have to worry about Iraq and power for modules.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.920
 Like, you know, does it have like a modulator on board?

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.240
 Yeah, it has some internal modulation stuff going on.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.240
 There you go.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.640
 But a lot of that I don't even think you can control like a lot of it just seems to be

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.160
 like doing its own magic under the hood.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.480
 They've decided what is the best or what is popular or the thing that if you bought

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.200
 this, this is probably what you want.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.320
 And if you're right, 99 out of 100 people that buy it, it's going to work for those

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.320
 people.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.040
 And if you are someone who's like, well, this isn't exactly what I want.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.720
 Well, then go get clouds and a bunch of modulation.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:55.920
 Like, if you watch videos for microcosm, they all sound 100% the same, you know what I

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.920
 mean?

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:03.120
 But like, it's that's a very focused sound that like people wanted, you know, to get

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.960
 out of clouds and other, you know, I don't even know what to really call that.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:15.800
 I guess granular style effects, you know, and like the Chase Bliss pedal, it's the

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.200
 same thing, you know what I mean?

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.440
 Like they all seem to be piggybacking off of things like clouds and other modules that

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.280
 we're doing that type of thing.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.720
 So do you see the future being the path of module comes out?

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.480
 People use it a bunch.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:35.080
 Everything sort of like funnels or converges into well, here's, you know, a good typical

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.440
 sound for that module and then it becomes pedal-ified.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.440
 Maybe.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.920
 I mean, it's definitely happening with a few specific sounds right now.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.080
 Just like the, you know, the lo-fi thing as well, you know what I mean?

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.080
 Like, people want that instant boards of Canada sound.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.040
 They don't want to have to use seven different modules to get there.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.840
 So pedal makers have been cranking out some very interesting lo-fi pedals that will get

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.480
 you there with minimal effort, you know?

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.480
 Yep.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.800
 And I can see why they would keep going because, you know, the attempts to make modular pedal

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.560
 boards kind of failed, you know, multiple people tried it and it never caught on.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.400
 Nobody wants to go that route.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.400
 Yeah.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.240
 It's still, it's still ultimately too complicated.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.800
 You are, you know, you're, that's not your, that's our focus.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.320
 Like, as people that are really interested in this stuff, you know, we want that kind

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.400
 of control and we want to figure with that for hours on end.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.240
 And someone else just goes, I've got notes.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.600
 I've got to work with this band.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.160
 I've got this, all these other considerations.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.560
 I need to hit that button and it makes it sound like this.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:43.040
 You know, maybe like a knob or two to control certain things, but the reality is they want

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.400
 it to be streamlined and very, very few options.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.400
 Yeah.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.240
 Like look at the Poly effects BBO, you know, like that was, that was meant to be a guitar

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.600
 pedal at first.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.400
 And like, it seems like a lot of guitar people were like, what the fuck, you know, like,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.760
 I don't want to deal with that.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.920
 But like modular synth people were like, this is fucking great.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.920
 This is like a mini, you know, modular that I can have in a little pedal board, you know,

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:13.560
 it's like synth nerds definitely are eating up those types of things more so than like

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.600
 the guitar and pedal enthusiasts.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.560
 Um, so is that what you see is like 2020 having a lot of because that's not something

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.640
 I like, frankly, I wasn't paying that close attention to it.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.600
 I knew about the digit stuff, but like the stuff, like the stuff you've rattled off.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.800
 I didn't know about.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.680
 Yeah, I think the most innovation, at least in my opinion, over the last year was in the

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.160
 world of pedals.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:43.760
 Um, from like mid 2019 to late 2020, there was a shit ton of really interesting pedals

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:48.080
 that came out to do very specific types of sounds that previously you'd probably only

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:55.000
 find in modular or with a combination of pedals and secret sauce, you know, and they're coming

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:02.360
 up with refined, you know, all in one pedals that can achieve that specific effect or processing

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.360
 sound.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.360
 And that's kind of cool.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:10.880
 I was always bummed that we didn't see more of the interesting pedals that have existed

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.480
 over the last 10 years get ported into modular.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.440
 And I always thought that that is something that they would do, but there's still not

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.440
 a lot of that happening.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.520
 We got like the Magneto from Strymon.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.440
 We got the afternith from the Dwarfcraft and stuff like that.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.440
 Buzz factory.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.440
 Buzz factory.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.440
 Yeah.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.440
 Yeah.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440
 But there's WMD.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.440
 There's a few.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.440
 Yeah.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.720
 But and most of the time, like they don't seem to be, I don't know, like they don't seem

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.800
 to be a better option over the pedal the a lot of times, you know, unless you're just

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.080
 looking for some CV.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.080
 Yeah.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.320
 It seems like they've just took that take them, taken the pedal, added a couple of modulation

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.240
 points and put, you know, change the power source.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.320
 It doesn't seem like it's a massive innovation or deviation.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.200
 The pedal is still a viable option when you're looking and comparing it to the module on

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.200
 a lot of cases.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.200
 Yeah.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:03.280
 I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm surprised that when someone releases a pedal in this

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.960
 day and age that they also don't have like a modular version of it that comes out at

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:14.920
 the same time, you know, like there still seems to be with a few exceptions, a very distinct

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.320
 line between pedals and modules, you know.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.600
 I feel like at one time I had a lot more pedals.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.680
 And now I don't have it.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.560
 I don't have a single pedal.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.560
 CV controlled effects or just effects in modular weren't nearly as popular at the outset too.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.560
 Yeah.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.560
 Yeah.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.560
 ZDSP was kind of a revolution.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.280
 And now it's like there are tons of things like that or at least, you know, it's crazy

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.920
 how many effects we have now and stereo or is before that shit didn't exist.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.240
 And there's still a lot that I don't consider that good either.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.240
 You know what I mean?

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.240
 Like, yeah.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.800
 A lot of the sex is where there's a lot of room for growth in modular.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.800
 Yeah.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.600
 Like, why hasn't Evan Tide done something that's like, you know, they made that delay

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.440
 module, but they haven't really done, you know, I'm sure they don't want to do an H9

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.440
 as a module.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.080
 And I could see why because it would kind of kill that market, even though they stopped.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.120
 I think they just stopped making those out, right?

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.240
 But they've never done like a real module that we've leveraged like they're crazy,

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.880
 like a like a black hole version or something or just like, I don't know, they haven't

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.880
 gone there.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.600
 I could see why too, because they're like kind of high end, you know, and how much like

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.800
 are people willing to spend on a single module?

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.680
 Some people like bitch a lot if something's like 600 bucks or like a rain maker and how

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680
 expensive it is.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.360
 And it's like, well, like, would you rather it not exist, you know, like, I know it's

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.080
 expensive, but there's a point where like that shit deserves like, you know, how much

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.080
 is an H9000?

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.440
 Like that shit's like five or six grand or something like that.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.440
 Yeah.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.720
 And if they put too much power to module, then it's like, what the fuck am I going to buy

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.720
 that?

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:50.240
 Like looking at something like Paul, Trevor, posting about the evolution of the Hyperion,

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.240
 because it's also expensive, but I think complaints are a little bit less because it's

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.360
 like, oh, I'm I've watched this guy's putting a ton of work into this.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.840
 This is this is their job.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.480
 And I'm paying not just for capacitors and resistors.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:08.120
 I'm paying for all of the all of the work that went into all of the work that, you know,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:14.480
 the program were put into this really getting a better sense of why these models maybe

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.200
 cost away as much as they do.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.200
 I don't know.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.720
 Maybe I'm hoping like that sort of visibility into the entire process from start to finish

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.200
 might make these price points a little bit more understandable.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.080
 Yeah, that thing's a fucking steal, honestly, in the Hyperion for what it does.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.160
 Like, no, but nothing else out there does that.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.760
 The H9 is probably your closest bet.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.000
 And that's like fucking way more expensive.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.480
 But if Paul had been just sort of like, you know, in his house, popped up said I'm doing

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.840
 this, and then months later, put it out, the fact that he's just been really forthcoming

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.200
 and transparent about the process.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.200
 I don't know.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.360
 Hopefully, like it lends people to understand that this is a really hard fucking thing to

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.360
 do.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.760
 Yeah, it's not easy.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:02.040
 Not just porting a VST into a box, you know, like the audio damage effects.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.800
 Yeah, which that's what you get.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.800
 Right.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.800
 Right.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.000
 Surprisingly, there hasn't really been anything since then.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.320
 Like even that was something that I thought would see more of effects wise.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:18.520
 It was like people's, you know, VSTs being ported into the world of modular.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.040
 But yeah, there wasn't many.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.760
 Like audio damage did it.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:27.600
 And that one reverb that you the US verb kind of crashed and burned.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.480
 And that was the end of it.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:34.560
 Like you can't even get like simple little effects, you know what I mean?

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.120
 And modular very easily.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.560
 At least not very good ones, you know.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.560
 So it's strange.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.560
 And those engineering with the other way, they took some of their modules and put them

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.560
 in the reason.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.560
 Yeah.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.560
 Right.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.560
 And they're weird.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.720
 Like people would rather invest in like having effects coming out of like a teensy CPU.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.200
 And there's like that hardware focus.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.320
 And so that software world doesn't get bridged very often because of that software world

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.480
 is, you know, it's not like easily portable.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.840
 That's like stacks of shitty code sometimes.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.240
 The Hyperion come out this year was at 2019.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.200
 I think it was late 2019, right?

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.080
 I don't think they were shipped until 2020.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.080
 Okay.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.640
 Yeah, I don't think so.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.600
 There might have been a few units in fall of last year.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.840
 That's what I think he was still prototyping in like November last year.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.720
 I remember seeing like we were at Opcon.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.440
 Yeah.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.080
 And that was a still very crude.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.080
 Yeah.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.080
 Yeah.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.160
 I don't think anyone got it in 2019.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.640
 Nope.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.400
 And I don't think any of the three of us have it, right?

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.400
 Yeah.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.080
 I don't know the rack space for it.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.800
 I still don't, but I could probably make some space for it at this point.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.000
 So I've sold a couple of things, but it's all my list of stuff to get eventually.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.360
 But like I wasn't in a major hurry because I knew that it was, you know, hard to get

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.360
 at the moment anyway.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.560
 So I was like, okay, I don't have really the money or the space for it at this moment.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.160
 So I'm just going to, you know, put it on the back burner for now, but I know I'll get

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.160
 one eventually.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.400
 The effects aid XL reduced my need for that quite a bit, you know?

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.400
 Yeah.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.680
 That's a pretty powerful thing.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.520
 It's already got what three CV inputs.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.600
 The Hyperion's got four.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.240
 I know his algorithms are different, but that made it a lot less interesting to me.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:24.960
 I still don't have one and I've been kind of putting it off because I just noticed from

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:31.840
 my own habits of buying things and selling things that usually the stuff that has multiple

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.200
 purposes, I end up selling.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:41.680
 Like, I've realized over time that like, I like things that have a single purpose for

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.600
 the most part, you know, like things that I don't have to think about.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:50.320
 Like the new noise engineering reverb, for example, like it's just doing reverb and like

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.000
 I already have memorized my favorite sweet spots for the knobs, you know what I mean?

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.360
 And I just plug something into it when I want that effect.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.360
 Like.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.520
 So you don't want the extra dimension of finding the sweet spot on one of 32 algorithms.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.000
 You like the idea that this is one.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.040
 You want algorithm and you can dial the fuck into it.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.040
 Yes.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:15.240
 And I think that's why the ZDSP has been a staple in my rig for many, many years now

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:20.560
 because my halls of a holocard seldom comes out of it.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.400
 And it's like eight reverbs that I'm well versed in, you know what I mean?

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.160
 I know where I want the three knobs to be for each of those algorithms.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:34.080
 And that's a that's a wrap, you know, like the the FX aid as appealing as it is, it's

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.400
 also very intimidating to me.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:43.800
 And I know I'm going to get lost in like what's the word option paralysis decision.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.800
 Yeah.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.800
 You know what I mean?

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.800
 Like, yeah.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.240
 And so I haven't gotten one yet.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.120
 Like even though I can do all those things, I feel like I might end up being less productive

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.240
 with it because it can do all those things.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.320
 So I've been like biting my time.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.920
 There's a new effects unit that's supposed to be in the works and coming out soon from

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.440
 chaos devices or ZOC as I like to call them.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:17.280
 But they it's going to have a screen and it's going to have like multifunctionality and things

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.280
 like that.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.720
 And like just the fact that it has a screen and will tell me like what effect is what

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.720
 and things like that.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.880
 It seems a little more stripped down.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.560
 I'm kind of waiting to see how that turns out because it's not too much bigger than the

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.880
 FX aid.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:35.000
 I think it's meant to be like a weird bridge between like ZDSP and FX aid.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.960
 Like I think it has a card slot in the whole nine yards.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.280
 So yeah, I'm just kind of biting my time and seeing how that turns out.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.760
 I guess I can understand it.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.560
 I mean, for me though, the FX aid is still the effects are logically grouped.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:53.560
 So there'll be, you know, eight in a row of reverbs and delays and there'll be some number

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.200
 in a row.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.320
 And so I've got, you know, I got to print out.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.560
 I'm doing some quick math in my head that is like, okay, I'm looking for numbers 12 through

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.280
 18 or let me go try 24 through 30.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.120
 And then within those I'm like, okay, I'm going to dial into the effect I'm looking

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.120
 for right then.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.000
 So even that much I find distracting.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 Okay.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Like even though it's not much like you're just referencing like you print out and shit

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 like that.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.040
 Like I find that that fucking slows me down.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.600
 Like I used to do that with the black hole DSP and I found that annoying.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.600
 You know what I mean?

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.600
 Like I don't know.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.280
 Even though it's not much, I don't want to have to reference a piece of paper every

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.600
 time I want an effect.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.760
 I just wanted to know in my head, this is the effect I want.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.520
 I need to plug into this module to get it.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.520
 You know what I mean?

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:46.200
 Like I don't know why it's just, it's only a couple extra steps, but it slows my role

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.320
 enough where it can be severely distracting and fuck up my flow.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.320
 I've noticed.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.320
 Much about this in the past though.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.920
 I mean, these are how our brands work and we can fight it or we can lament.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.720
 I wish I could do this differently, but at some point you're just going to lean into

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.400
 it and go, I know what works for me and what doesn't.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.360
 And it's not working for you and you know that's going to be more stressed than productivity.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.640
 Fucking don't do it.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.320
 That's what I've been working on.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:17.640
 I think 2020 was, I spent most of that of the year not buying more stuff, but just figuring

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:24.760
 out what I don't need and trimming the fat and simplifying my rig into what I like the

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:32.600
 most and that's controls up front, limited menu diving, limited multi-purpose modules,

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.040
 more single purpose modules.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.040
 Even if that means eating up more rack space, I prefer it.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.540
 You know, it's like...

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:46.120
 That could segue nicely into perhaps we can get into your top three, 2020.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.120
 My top three.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.120
 Yeah.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.120
 My top three.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.120
 Did you say that top three?

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.120
 Yeah.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:57.760
 I just feel like I babbled enough already, but yeah, I can shut up for a minute if someone

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.400
 else wants to start with their top three.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.960
 Nick, would you like to start with your top three?

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.360
 You start, Dave.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.360
 Me.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.360
 Yeah.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.320
 All right, I will start then.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:13.640
 I don't think this is a huge surprise considering how long I went into it last time, the module

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.680
 of the year for me, and I just may not even really necessarily qualify.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.920
 It doesn't have to be module.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.280
 Just top gear of the year.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.280
 Right.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:27.120
 Well, does it have to have come out in 2020 or is it just like I got it in 2020?

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:34.440
 I think we discussed this last time and we decided like if you got it in that year,

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.440
 it counts.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.440
 I guess.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.440
 We'll count it.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.440
 Yeah.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.440
 Also, this is our rules.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.440
 We can make up, do whatever the fuck we want.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.440
 Right.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.440
 That's true.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:47.520
 But for mine, head and shoulders above everything else is the humble quad operator.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.680
 We don't need to re-litigate it because I went into depth last time about it.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.160
 Listeners can go back and listen to that episode if they're interested.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:04.440
 I guess the only thing I would like to add is it's not like I've changed my mind since

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.440
 then.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.160
 It's actually only gotten better.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:13.120
 Now that I'm diving into it and getting into it more and pushing different things that

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.360
 you know weren't obvious the first time.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.320
 Yeah, it's living up to what I'd hoped it would be.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320
 And it's still right now.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.840
 It's the centerpiece of everything I'm doing.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:30.680
 So yeah, it's like I said, unsurprisingly, that is my top.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.800
 And that one was easy.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:40.040
 So going on to two and three FX-8 is number two, just because I'm getting, isn't every

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.800
 patch now and everything sounds good.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.200
 It's still, I'm still surprised that it handles and makes everything sound good.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.200
 I don't understand what they did.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.200
 Anything specific?

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.520
 Like are you just using it as a full on multi-effects or is there something in particular you find

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.720
 yourself going to for every patch with it?

00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.720
 No, it's small.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.720
 And I have two of them now.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:04.520
 The original and the XL.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.080
 So now, I'm chaining them.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.080
 Fuck yeah.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.440
 I love chaining them.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.120
 And I'm not, like I don't feel like I'm going to the same well.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.640
 I mean, eventually over time, that's just what's going to happen.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.880
 I know my brain, you know, certain things work better than others.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.760
 So I will start using them more often.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.680
 I think that maybe it almost goes back to what you were saying, great.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.160
 Like everything sounds good.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.960
 So, you know, just as I'm going through, I have to keep track of like, okay, that's

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:32.960
 not a good.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.160
 Okay, those two sound good.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.160
 That's not a good.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.160
 Okay.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.160
 There's about 20 combinations that sound good and I'm not going to start narrowing those

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.640
 down into what, you know, what I actually want.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:46.800
 I could easily have four of them and keep them just on like, I do keep one on this specific

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.400
 delay combo right now and it's like, I'd never change it.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.760
 I could see having like eight of them to be honest, just leaving them on effects and

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.120
 not fucking changing it.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.120
 And I still have not added or changed the effects that came with it.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.080
 And that's probably going to change here soon just because they keep adding new stuff.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.400
 And one of you posted the, the Igor effects now.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.000
 The stereo filters that dropped today, they look pretty sick.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.400
 Yeah, they sound good.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.160
 I think, I think my time of using the stock and not screwing around with changing them

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.480
 is, is nearing an end, at least for one of them.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:29.120
 I'll probably keep the XL as is and use the, the original one as the, the, the guinea pig

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:35.680
 for trying the new stuff, just fill the whole thing up with a bunch of stuff that I don't,

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.960
 you know, like basically trying out, there's enough new stuff that I can have an entirely

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.040
 separate new bank and start experimenting with those.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.920
 So yeah, that's, that's my number two.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:51.600
 And number three, and I think this one really is pushing the boundaries of what constitutes

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.360
 2020 dark matter.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.360
 Oh fuck yeah.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.360
 It was that 2019.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.360
 I think it was 2019.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.880
 I think it was like, yeah, I didn't get it until 2020.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.760
 I don't think I got it until 2020 or more accurately, I didn't start using the shit out

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.920
 of it until 2020.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:14.040
 The, the thing that I think like, like, that I still really enjoy is the fact that I am,

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.240
 it still shocks me sometimes, not physically.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.200
 Like it's, you know, it is properly grounded, but like there are times where I'm like, I'm

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.800
 going to send this through here and I've got like a pretty good idea of how it's going

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.040
 to sound and it does for a second.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:30.960
 And then I just change something slightly and it just goes nuts and it's, and it's like

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.960
 delightful.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.960
 Yeah.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.920
 It is like, oh, I didn't know you're going to do this record is because I may not get

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.920
 this if I, if I cycle power.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:43.440
 Yeah, as far as a fun experiment box and just fucking things up and seeing what happens.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.520
 I fucking still love it.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.280
 It's got a lot of places to like change the gain stage and distortion to in like different

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.760
 ways.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.760
 That's always a lot of fun with that for me.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.680
 Like the sample rate and then the overdrive and then the filter overdrive and there's

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.640
 a lot of play in there.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:05.280
 And like the way it behaves to CV, depending on, you know, even like even slow CV has this

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.280
 sort of weird thing.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:11.120
 And then you put in faster, you know, audio rate stuff in there and it just completely

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.480
 changes the dynamics of everything that it's doing.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.480
 Yeah.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.440
 So that's my top three.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.640
 I think I've covered all of them, at least in an episode.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.440
 So that's mine.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.440
 Who's next?

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.440
 Okay.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:29.920
 I'll do mine in reverse order from bronze metal up to gold.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:36.240
 Definitely will give the bronze metal to the sweet 16 from tester act module or the 16

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.240
 end controller.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:42.760
 Yeah, I should have had a 16 end controller for the 301 way fucking back because that's

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.200
 like a total game changer for that module.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.640
 Changed how I thought about using it in live sets.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.360
 It's just fucking indispensable.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.600
 It's right into the 301 now.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:57.640
 I originally started with the slate and ash 16 end controller, which was output only.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:04.080
 So it had a USB and then CV and I2C output kind of hated the cable hanging out of the

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:07.960
 modular and like having to build like a panel for that and I just didn't fucking like it.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:14.480
 But the sweet 16 I really wanted and had somebody shout out to Pierre Paulo in Italy

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.200
 who actually built the module for me and was like a fucking pleasure to work with.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.360
 Unlike getting the performer built, which I'll talk about a little, but Pierre Paulo

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.360
 was awesome.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.280
 Had that shit like gave me status updates every day about what was going on and had my

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.320
 modified panel out.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:34.840
 But it has inputs so you can have CV control the actual knobs that are controlling the

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:40.520
 301 and you can also do CV to MIDI conversion since it outputs MIDI too.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.360
 So I used to have that H9 module.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.800
 The I forget what the fuck they were called Northern light module or something like that.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.640
 It would control the H9 pedal.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.280
 You can do that same thing with this module.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.680
 That's like the least interesting thing.

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.920
 But CV controlling all those knobs on like 301 presets that you have saved and being able

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:04.520
 to recall that shit like changes how I patch the whole thing like now I just use modulators

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:09.200
 freely during a live set knowing that I can just hook them up to these faders on that

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.560
 16 and controller and it'll control the 301 shit.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.120
 So now it's like oh I need an LFO let me go take that and then patch that in in real

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.880
 time instead of trying to be like all right this is already dedicated for this one patch.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:28.560
 Yeah 16 and controller fucking mind blowing making like little FM machines with the 301

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.520
 and just presets now using the faders that's fucking sick.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:38.040
 Yeah that's the third spot game changer definitely love that module.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:45.480
 Number two absolutely the ILabs flux which is blowing my fucking mind right now.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.440
 When I preordered well yeah I was on the preorder I was after the Kickstarter I was

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.560
 on like the last group of people that got in to get a flux module and of course Greg

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.400
 was going on about it and I was very interested.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:01.480
 I was so worried it was going to be so complicated and take me like off my path but it's not

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:07.720
 it's like dead easy to use in a lot of ways and just lets me add like crazy drum fills.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:14.160
 I fucking love it so much that's some cold dead hand shit for me now for sure.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.680
 That's the number two easy easy I'm not including the effects aid that could that probably be

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:24.040
 number four if I was going to put it on that list that's game changer two.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.360
 So yeah the flux I definitely want sitting right next to the Westlake performer which

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:32.880
 is absolutely by far number one fucking game changing module for me for the year.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.960
 That thing is the fucking best year Iraq sequence I've ever used.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:41.800
 It's the perfect companion to the flux which goes crazier in a different way with the

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:46.560
 roles and the ability to do all that shit but the flux is like the best balance of like

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:52.000
 a it's like a MIDI box in a modular but not as complicated but still like four CV inputs

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.320
 that you can route to like all sorts of fucking shit any it's eight tracks any of those tracks

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:03.720
 can also just be a CV recorder that you can also fuck with CV so I can just you can have

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:08.000
 a envelope sequence that's 64 steps and be like oh I like that I'm just going to record

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.800
 it into a track of this sequencer and then I can free up this envelope to do something

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:18.280
 else and it's also I can play it back now as a preset that kind of changed how I thought

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:23.480
 about shit between that and the sweet 16 that like kind of blew my mind thinking about

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:28.920
 okay I can have these little parts of performance is saved but it just fucking works to the

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:34.320
 Westlake performer there's like a I'm looking right now to remind myself of the features

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:39.080
 at the like simulator that's built in JavaScript that's like a full they push out the new

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:43.760
 GitHub build and it's also reflected in this test drive thing where you can like use the

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:50.600
 module and it's super straightforward I love that it's 64 steps you can hook up a launch

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:55.840
 pad to it like innovation launch pad so I have a launch pad mark three that I got and

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.720
 it lets you just trigger the patterns like Ableton session view and that's also been

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:04.960
 like a fucking mind blower for me because it makes it so easy to like sketch out a performance

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.400
 I can just go to the third session and the next time I boot up the modular it's going

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.640
 to come up on that third session and I can just write the next part and be like oh yeah

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:18.360
 I also wrote part two last night it corresponds to track one of my ER 301 and it's been easy

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.920
 to sketch out a live set with that shit and you can go into like pattern mode to and

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:29.800
 also just change like edit the 64 steps and like any of the pages on the performer and

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:34.040
 it has like no probability and all that shit you can edit any of the pages on the like

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.280
 pad grid which sometimes is useless like sometimes it's like gate length on a track which is

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.680
 kind of cool but it's like why am I setting gate length on a track with a slider it's

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:49.560
 like that's kind of novel but you know I've done it a few times too but it's also got

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:53.520
 the note conditions from the electron which is what really sold me on this because it's

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:57.600
 it's like they decided to make an eloquence or and then destroy it with more features

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.880
 and also make it open source which is what they did it is if you have an eloquence or

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:06.720
 you should probably get this because it's better to it's easier to use honestly cheaper

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:13.320
 to that it's way cheaper I saved money by selling it it has all the MIDI input shit in

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.720
 a smaller space without having the expander which I will say on the eloquence and I may

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:21.760
 have touched on this the last time that my modular like fucked up one day because that

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:27.200
 expander became detached after I took it somewhere to get a cabin and came back this

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:32.400
 doesn't have that problem also like that grid on that eloquence is kind of useless it's

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.880
 kind of eye candy there's like a eye candy mode on the eloquence that lets you get to

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.600
 that and realize like it's kind of pointless to see all those steps at once you just want

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:45.640
 to drill into the thing you're looking at and using you and go to the next track that

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:50.640
 was useless not to derail your conversation but yeah that was one of my I recently sold

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.960
 my yield sequencer as well and that was one of the main things when I bought it I didn't

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:59.560
 realize that you couldn't change views of any sort you're locked to the to looking at

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:05.160
 all those tracks on that grid and you can't do like a zoom in on a specific track and

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:10.840
 like blow it out so that you can see like maybe 64 steps of track one all at once or

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:15.840
 anything like that like it's just not there and I'm like this is kind of this is kind

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.880
 of dumb you know it's like yeah and I like dump sequencers but that was like to dumb

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:26.480
 for me I was like shit because then it dumps everything else to that tiny eloquence or

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:31.080
 screen where you had to get all the info right and though Westlake just has one fucking

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:36.320
 big OLED with all that shit it's like a twenty five dollar OLED it's not a hard one

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:41.400
 to get and they're fucking beautiful and you can get different colors it's like you can

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.120
 choose how you want the sequence to work it's all open source if I didn't say that so it's

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:51.120
 kind of fucking sick you can build it for 200 bucks if you want to do surface mount soldering

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.600
 where you can pay some techno asshole to build you one and then fuck around with you for

00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.880
 a while to never ship you the rotary encoder and give you a broken LED and ship it to you

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:06.520
 in a shitty box hypothetically speaking I won't name I won't name the person that who

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:12.920
 theoretically could have built that for me in New York but fuck you it's I don't care

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:17.640
 that was a bullshit experience you can see the reverb common if you really want to find

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:23.280
 out who because the sequencer is that fucking good that it was still a no regrets I fucking

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:27.520
 love that thing that kind of ruled out that in the flux I don't see much room for other

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:35.320
 sequencers I sold the varigates in the eloquencer to get some other modules and the West like

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:39.840
 was part of that because I paid like 400 for it in the end have it built which was fine

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:44.600
 it does work like his soldering was good it's cool but the module is fucking hype like I

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:49.880
 love building sets with it I love someone referred to it as like a battleship sequencer

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:53.200
 like there are all these sequencers like that that are kind of like super complicated like

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.920
 the vector and all these big battleship sequencers I think it's the easiest one to use there's

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.440
 like no learning curve I haven't even looked at the manual for it that much kind of like

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.080
 the flux to you don't need the manual for that too much either once you figure out how

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:11.480
 to get around that thing they're both fucking sick as hell like those of those have been

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:18.000
 like the top two for the year easy wow I'm intrigued by it but also intimidated like I

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.440
 watched a couple YouTube videos and just seemed like just seemed like really many diving to

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:28.640
 me and I was like this looks like something that Nick would dig for sure but would probably

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.320
 I'd probably be struggling to wrap my head around for quite some time to get familiar

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:38.920
 with it but I definitely am intrigued by the power of it especially the whole like Euclidean

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.720
 areas that you can dive into and things like that I was like that looks pretty red yeah

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:48.760
 the randomization the Euclidean shit because really like there aren't many combos it's

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:53.680
 the same combo on every screen actually which is the nice thing okay and that gets you to

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:58.280
 the extra stuff that you want to get to but it's it's really simple I don't know I'm broken

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.760
 because I'm used to like absorbing these fucking battleship sequencers at this point

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:07.520
 right owned most of them there aren't many I haven't fucking tried I never got used to

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:13.280
 the varigate like that the varigate was like that for me it always felt like I had to remember

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.960
 all these fucking combos to get to things and that's what killed it for me that and all

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:22.600
 the bugs that they never fixed and but not having any kind of screen on the varigate meant

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.920
 that you had them understand all of the blinking lights that were blinking at you and how to

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:31.280
 get into the real-time record mode and like I would overwrite shit all the time by doing

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:37.920
 it wrong and it fucking drove me nuts yeah the the West Lick is dope I fucking like it

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:44.360
 it's it's the easiest one for me it feels less divey than the eloquence or that felt

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:49.560
 like really divey to me I hated it getting to like all the options for the MIDI and shit

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:56.560
 like that it was hard whereas this is like nice to it's you can just take any tracks output

00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:00.520
 and route it to another track too so you can have like a shape track another cool thing

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:06.560
 is like the CV recorder track also functions like a massive if you use that VST style like

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:11.600
 shape design so you can just like make like give me six saws on each of these steps and

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.080
 then they'll affect all these parameters and you can route that to like the clock divisions

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:21.040
 of another track and just do all this internal routing to like you can get massively fucked

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:26.680
 up sequences from it deeper than anything I've ever used you can have a lot of CV affecting

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:32.320
 how the sequencers operate to the point where it's just IDM fucking shit show for sure that's

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:37.160
 one of the best things about it the vector got there and that the vector was super drivey

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:41.560
 for me in a way that I absolutely hated and I think though West Lick is a lot easier

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:47.640
 than the vector for sure the vector had roads that I never attempted to drive down there

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:52.760
 was a few paths that I was well versed with and I was like okay as long as I know how

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:59.880
 to do XYZ I'm I'm content with that but it got to the point where like due to like all

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:05.560
 the updates and stuff like even my XYZ started getting more convoluted and changed and you

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:11.240
 know buried in other functionalities and stuff and I'm like this thing I feel like an an

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:18.880
 asshole for owning it at this point because it can do all this and I'm just using it for

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:24.480
 this you're taking you're taking your Ferrari to go get groceries right take a Ferrari to

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:30.360
 go go to the fucking grocery store it just this is too much sequencer for me you know

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.960
 I mean I was like it has a few tricks up its leaves that I really like that I don't think

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:40.480
 are in other sequencers but it's just I hated the fact that I wasn't I was so under utilizing

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:48.920
 it I was like I should sell this and get a different sequencer and I hate to they still

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:53.240
 haven't gotten the sync input to work on the vector correctly no last I chat yeah that

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:58.720
 was still buggy part of the thing with the performer to and this is upsetting about the

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:03.040
 eloquencers you know he did like that beta at the start of quarantine and there hasn't

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:06.240
 been an update to it since even though it was like oh there's just one more thing I've

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:11.960
 got to fix like half a year ago and I was at the point where unless it's open source I

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:17.400
 don't want your fucking sequencer anymore I want it so that I can maintain it and so that

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:21.680
 I can understand the code and then it can't be like a fucking abandoned where because I

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:26.120
 just don't trust I don't trust these people to finish the work it's too hard but yeah that's

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:32.960
 my top three the performer is easily top one for sure that's awesome I'm glad you're digging

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.760
 it and getting a lot of use out of it I'm also glad to hear that it's working well with

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:43.280
 the flux and there's like a I can't tell which ones the ego which ones the id the super ego

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:49.560
 but it sounds like they're working together to form a cogent consciousness yeah the way

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:55.400
 you can do the drum roll programming in the flux is just brilliant that shit is just fucking

00:53:55.400 --> 00:54:00.600
 genius yeah I try telling you dude but it was like no way for me to yeah to describe it

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.600
 that's why I just kept saying like all it'll handle rules man because like I didn't know

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.720
 how else to like explain like it's one of those things you just got experience it was

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.960
 the compression thing is when I got it to when I realized because I wanted to um I didn't

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.560
 know if you could make rolls longer than a step and then I realized with the compression

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:20.640
 that's how you can kind of stretch that shit out then it was like boom or condense it yeah

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:26.040
 yeah or condense it yep that's the crazy thing is everything about it can go both ways you

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:30.840
 know I mean you can have sequences within sequences or like a full sequence on a single

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:37.240
 step and just blow it out you know like it's fucking ridiculous yeah it's yeah it's awesome

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:43.680
 you killed it that's fucking so good Greg yes you do you have a top three you can you

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.440
 can pick ascending or descending whichever or yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna follow next lead

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.680
 and start in reverse order you could do it like a binary tree and start in the middle

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:58.720
 no start it too so I have a tie for three for the bronze middle or I don't even want

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:05.680
 to call it bronze because like my favorites right now I think are like all gold you know

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:11.160
 what I mean it's like they're all like top picks right now like I'm very happy with all

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:16.520
 them you don't get to say that you love all your show you've got it you've got to decide

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:28.280
 yeah so number three I have a tie with cosmatorronics cosmics and WMD carbon which we've talked

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:33.960
 about we've talked about both of these modules in our you know most recent episodes so I'm

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:40.440
 not gonna go on and on about them in depth again but I just will say that like both of

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:49.040
 them are integral for my patching lately like the cosmics and its ability to just route

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:56.480
 auxiliary shit and then come back in and apply multiple levels of saturation and you know

00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:03.120
 just I'm getting a lot of use out of it is what I'll say and I absolutely love the distortion

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:09.240
 it's the closest thing to like what I used to be able to do with you know an old Mackie

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:15.320
 within a modular that have been you know in a long time I like that it gets me there in

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:21.520
 fact it's it's not only my favorite like mixer module at the moment it's my favorite distortion

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:27.280
 module like I just I love the grime that I can get out of it and the balance that I

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.880
 can get with it as well knowing knowing you for so long that is there's zero surprise

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:38.080
 and that is yeah that is how you've used mixtures in the past yeah mixers that were other people

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:44.840
 would have thrown out right I want a cos mix that's one of the few modules that I want

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:50.320
 right now but they're really fucking hard to find they are I had to go across the ocean

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:58.080
 to get the two that I have in my rack currently and cough up extra for shipping it was like

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:05.360
 thirty bucks a piece to ship but I wondered it that badly that I coughed it up twice you

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:09.320
 know what I mean I was like fuck it it's worth it I imagine you meant that you just looked

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.800
 overseas on the internet but in my mind for a split second I'm imagining you know I took

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:18.800
 a fucking ship yeah like a fucking ship and like you would like fight see like sea monsters

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:28.800
 and I hit away in a big connex box and I got scurvy at one point I had to eat rats yeah

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:39.960
 but yeah between the cos mix and the W&D carbon I getting a lot of saturation combos out of

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:45.400
 the two you know and the wave folding and just the fact that it's a multi mode good sounding

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:51.880
 filter in such a small package like it's it's um it's my go to at this point I need

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:58.760
 to have more of them in my rig I still only have one because I'm trying to only buy used

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:05.400
 right now to save a few bucks when I can and I've only seen one pop up used so far so I

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.800
 mean I'm like likewise I carbon is in almost every patch I have and I think maybe that's

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:14.160
 why it didn't make my list is I've just kind of forgot that it's there it's like the back

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:21.080
 of my hand in a lot of cases it's the perfect utility filter I mean like it's it does everything

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:25.080
 it's supposed to do does everything I want to do I would just stop thinking about it like

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:31.000
 everything we said in the original episodes talking about it still stand mm-hmm yeah I

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.560
 love it I love the performance features they put into it too it's awesome I think all of

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:40.820
 us mentioned that we've been digging into the wave folding more like I know yeah originally

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:44.120
 I didn't think I would even be touching the wave folding in there because I had enough

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:48.680
 things to do that and I just thought okay that's a nice novelty that they threw in there that

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:52.880
 didn't you know that it didn't need to but the fact that a sire is cool but no I'm like

00:58:52.880 --> 00:59:00.080
 actually finding myself utilizing it quite a bit now especially in combination with my

00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:07.440
 plates modules it just sounds good going through that wave folder but that's yeah that's my

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:15.920
 three it's a tie between those two number two also was the flux temporal sequencer it changed

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:23.680
 the game as far as gate sequencing goes just like I had hoped it would had a lot had a

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:30.120
 lot invested in it whenever whenever I did the kickstarter you know I mean like I refrained

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:36.280
 from buying other gate sequencers for several months because I had a lot riding on the flux

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:43.000
 that I hoped that it would be able to fulfill and it has like ten times over like it's it

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:49.320
 does more than I expected it to you know it's definitely a worthwhile investment and then

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:56.560
 number one the poly and tracker which I have a lot to say about to be clear we've not really

00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:01.560
 dove into it in an episode quite yet we've talked about it here and there I don't think

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:08.000
 we've done the deep dive on this not because I had I think the last time we did an episode

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:15.920
 I'm I don't even think I had it yet or it was on the way yeah yeah and yeah I since the

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:24.000
 last episode I finally got one and I spent a lot of quality time with it over the last

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.480
 two months I think it's been it's just a fucking amazing piece of kit in my opinion it's the

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:36.600
 sampler slash sequencer like powerhouse that I've been looking for for a long time

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:44.720
 I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I am like we said before I was never a big tracker

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:53.920
 guy you know I mean like I when it came to like my DAW I was always using piano roll to

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.200
 sequence everything you know and I was mainly using reason FL studio and audio mulch I was

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.440
 never really never really got into a tracker every time I'd mess with one it just felt

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:11.320
 like too weird and spreadsheet like and you know full of arcane hex symbols and shit

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.240
 I'm like I don't know what the fuck's going on you know I mean like I like modular layouts

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.320
 you know I'd like the interface of reason I like the modularity of audio mulch and I'd

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:26.960
 liked just the layout of FL studio as a sampler you know like I would just drop multiple sample

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:35.640
 tracks together use piano roll layer them up done deal this thing kind of feels like

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:43.280
 a really refreshing change of pace and but also not all that unfamiliar like it's I don't

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.320
 know it's it's interesting so it doesn't have the sort of like foreboding density of like

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.800
 renoise or like the thing that sort of like turned you off the tracker software I don't

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.680
 know what turned me off about it honestly like it's just never really appealed to me you

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.320
 know what I mean like I just it wasn't what I started out in and I never felt the need

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:08.320
 to readjust to learn it and I was like right I'm getting by just fine using you know piano

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.480
 rolls I don't I don't need to sequence vertically yeah we talked about this in the past because

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.880
 like to me like had the opposite approach like starting on like fast tracker to and like

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.800
 trackers click with my brain and then renoise was the massive super upgrade to all of them

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.200
 so that's why I was really really interested to hear what you had to say about the like what

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.640
 you had to say with it from like a perspective of not just being like super in the trackers yeah

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:40.240
 I'm super into this one so you know I mean I can't really compare to renoise and things like that I

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.680
 I've glanced at renoise and stuff like that I've used them very very briefly so like my familiarity

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:51.120
 with it is like next to nothing I just knew that like I was struggling to understand what

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:59.920
 meant what you know on each step whereas with the poly end I'm grasping it very well and I haven't

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:09.040
 even looked at the manual yet and I'm making like tracks on it all I did like for Halloween I went

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:17.920
 up to a cabin in New York for the weekend by Lake Erie and I took it with me I was like this will

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.560
 be a good opportunity maybe you know at night to start to learn this thing when I get bored I

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:29.920
 just threw it in my laptop bag with some headphones and that was it and on my phone I pulled up like

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:36.880
 a couple tutorial videos that they had on the poly end site and I looked at a couple videos that

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.680
 Stasma the Jungle Christ had posted on like his Instagram and YouTube showing off some of the

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.200
 crazy shit he was doing and like just from you know glancing at those videos I learned enough to

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:52.480
 start making tracks on it and I might be missing a few things that is detailed in the manual but

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.480
 so far I feel like I feel like I'm navigating everything you know I mean like there's not much

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:03.600
 that is a mystery to me or things that I'm just like not using because I don't understand them

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.880
 like I feel like I'm taking advantage of pretty much everything that's in there currently and

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:16.240
 it's it's pretty cool the speed at which I can work on it is the main appealing thing to me like I

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.320
 find myself not even using the jog wheel much at this point like I'm kind of just pounding away on

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:27.120
 the directional keys and doing the shortcuts already yeah it's I can move quick on it like very quickly

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.920
 now how the words where do you see this residing in your overall workflow either at home or in a

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:40.480
 live set already it's become like the heart of my setup like I'm using it for sequencing and sampling

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:47.600
 in the whole nine yards I currently my sequencing options are limited because I only have as far as

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:55.600
 MIDI to CV goes that um busy circuits mm MIDI module which is only two channels um so I have two

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:01.360
 tracks dedicated all times now on the poly end like going into the air and just um sequencing

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:13.440
 things in the modular I have a um 64 pixels uh CV OCD OCD yeah on the way um that was awesome

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:19.360
 that'll give me a lot more functionality and free up some rack space as far as like MIDI to CV

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:27.760
 goes and then from the once I have that I can pretty much program my entire like drum tracks you

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:34.000
 know on there alongside whatever I have going on like sound and sample wise on the poly end like

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.600
 I've been just dumping files from that I've recorded from the modular into it and just sequencing it

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:48.320
 and um slicing it things like that it's like everything that I wanted to like about bitbox and

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:55.360
 octatrack and shit about but never really jived with um I'm I can do it on this thing and very

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:04.000
 quickly um it has some limitations that I can complain about but even those are minor um

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:12.240
 the main being it's only has one stereo output um you have no ability to route like multiple

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:17.600
 stereo outs to other tracks or to other effects you know processors and things like that you just

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:25.360
 got your main stereo out which is a bit of a bummer um but you can there is an on board function to

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:30.160
 multi-track like bounce down each track separately to to waves and then you can

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:36.160
 port that in wherever but oh that's cool it is that's how I'm using utilizing it currently but

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:42.080
 still it would have been nice to be able to route through multiple hardware paths of effects in

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:49.360
 real time uh the samples are mono only that's kind of a bummer um anything stereo that I put in

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:55.600
 air gets auto converted to mono so I don't have to convert it myself that's kind of nice but still

01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:03.440
 um and then three the amount of project RAM available it's a little limited um I'm not going

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:09.840
 to be dumping like full stems into this thing and using it like I would my teraz um which is

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:16.000
 going to limit um its usefulness for me live what is what is the limit I don't remember the exact

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.440
 number I for some reason I think I'm thinking like 600 megs or 900 megs or something like that

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:27.760
 I could be way off track but that's just the number that's in my head um and there's a max

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:34.320
 length of time per sample too so like I can't have full like stems going in there anything like

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:41.600
 that alongside with like live you know sampling stuff have to keep it to relatively smaller sample

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:48.640
 files or slices but it's more than like a second it's not like it's not like literally a single hit

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:54.960
 no okay like you can like I've already made some breaks on the modular and dumped them in there and

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.680
 I think stasma also had like a default sound pack included in there there's a little bunch of

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:04.320
 different like amen breaks that you can practice slicing on and shit like that and then the fourth

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:12.320
 and final like minor complaint is the it only comes with two dongles yet there's four ports

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.440
 which is a little weird to me like you have to pick and choose what you're going to use the two

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.520
 dongles for that they gave you either you can either use it for your midi in or your midi out and

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:26.480
 then the audio ones for your audio in and audio out so like can you get more and use them all

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:33.040
 you can and they're expensive like the official ones from polyan cost 20 bucks a pop

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:44.240
 and I ordered them and this led to a weird email exchange with them so on their website they

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:50.960
 advertise these dongles of being corded braids high quality and you know they have the polyan

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:55.840
 logos on them so that like you don't mix them up with the five other billion dongles that you

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:00.240
 have sitting around you know you know it's the right type you know what machine it goes to

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:05.360
 and i'm like fair enough i'm sold fuck it so i bought the two more so that i could utilize all

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:13.280
 four ports on the thing and the midi dongle that i got wasn't braided and it didn't have the logo

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:16.640
 on it and i was like what the fuck so i held it up to one of the ones that i've gotten from

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:24.960
 amazon recently the generic ass like two dollar midi dongle yeah identical i was like did they

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:31.360
 seriously just sell me a generic dongle for 20 dollars so i emailed them and i was like what the

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:38.160
 hell and they shipped me the correct one which was nice um and they said it was a warehouse mix up

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:46.240
 which i guess shit happens fair enough um but still it's it felt a little weird it seems weird

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.680
 that they even had those at the ready do you know what i mean like why were those even in arms reach

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.160
 i don't know because you can't buy a generic one from their store you can only buy their

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:04.000
 so i'm like i was confused by why yeah so but they sorted it out and now i have the official dongles

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.520
 but um i i feel like you know this thing only has four ports like why not include

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.120
 dongles for all four ports like i feel like that should be a given um it should be

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:22.720
 but other than those four minor complaints i'm like in love with this thing like i don't see it

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:30.320
 i i don't see it not being in every patch that i make right now like so do you see a scenario where

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:38.160
 you have a second one i've already considered that yeah um i have to be honest yeah because i mean

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:44.560
 it is a little limited and it would be hard to bounce from track to track in like a live performance

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:49.360
 especially if you're doing something kind of broken up or you're shifting tempos and things

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:55.760
 like that like i feel like it would be beneficial to do it old school break core style and have two

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:00.560
 of them and maybe a dj mix room between the two that you can fade and bounce between or you know

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:08.320
 i mean have one maybe focused on drum duties and then your second one focused on like your melodic

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.040
 elements or things like that that way you can shift things around more um and for the price and

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:18.880
 the size you could i feel like yeah it's it's kind of a no-brainer you know i mean like you get two of

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.160
 these things especially if you're getting them second hand for lower the cost and you know a

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:31.440
 laptop or two NPCs or two terazas or whatever to octa tracks for that matter you know i mean like

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.400
 i feel like the price for the functionality that you get out of this thing is kind of insane and

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.360
 plus you already have the suitcase that has two electribes and a shitty dj mixer between them

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.840
 ready you just take the electribes out you put these two the two polyantrakers and you're ready to go

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:51.280
 it's so compact when i went to the cab and i literally just slid it into my laptop bag on top

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:57.440
 of my laptop like it just slid right in there like nothing like it is very thin very small

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:04.080
 you know i i can definitely see these being utilized live a lot um it just the fact that it

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:09.360
 has that limited project ram available that i'm gonna have to figure out like what to do it with

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:15.200
 like i'm probably not gonna sell my teraz anytime soon like i can see this being utilized with the

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:23.120
 teraz or just having two of these or something but oh the only thing i find which is not really a

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:31.040
 complaint but just lacking is the send effects since i've bought it they've already updated it

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:37.520
 the firmware i think three times and in one of those updates it implemented the overdrive which is nice

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:46.080
 but that's the third effect now compared to the delay and the reverb that they added in an update

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:51.280
 also so yeah you only got three send effects i would like to see a lot more that way you can get

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:57.600
 into more sound design territories with this um they have more effects on board if you're going

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:03.280
 to use the sample editor but that's not live that's destructive editing once you're in like a sample

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:09.040
 editing mode um so yeah i'd like to see some of those effects ported over into like their

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:16.800
 send effects for you know live processing but yeah that's my number one wow that's awesome

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.800
 also.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:47.800
 [Music]

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.800
 It's telling people I hate Christmas music.

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.800
 [Laughter]

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.800
 This is going to be a bitter episode, boys.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:56.800
 Strap in.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:57.800
 [Laughter]

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.800
 This year sucked.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.800
 There's a lot of bomb bugging going on here.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.800
 So wait, what three spirits are going to visit us to change our mind?

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.800
 [Laughter]

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.800
 Every time someone patches rings in the clouds and angel gets their wings.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.800
 Oh my God.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.800
 [Laughter]
