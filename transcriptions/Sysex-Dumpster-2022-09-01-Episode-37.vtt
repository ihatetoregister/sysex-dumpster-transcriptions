00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.560
 [Music]

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.000
 Should we dock Flutter Patreon?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.360
 We have a Patreon.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.520
 You the listener should join it.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.080
 Great. What do our listeners get if they join?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.600
 That sounds great. Tell me more.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.240
 Um, Discord access.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.360
 First off, we set up a really nice Discord for everyone.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.000
 Here's a question.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.640
 Does everyone at this point know what Discord is?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.280
 I think so.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.680
 Yeah.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.040
 Is it ubiquitous?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.680
 I think so.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.000
 Okay.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.680
 I didn't know if this was a chance for us to discuss what Discord is.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.520
 I think it's bigger than Facebook at this point.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.760
 Yeah. For all the stuff we don't explain,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.920
 we could probably, no one's probably safe.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.320
 Okay.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.720
 I mean, I don't even know how I would describe Discord at this point.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.120
 It's like IRC with voice chat.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.920
 Yeah.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.720
 And video.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.840
 It's video fair.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.240
 shitty video.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.920
 Fuck I'm dating myself, aren't I?

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.600
 Oh, that was, I thought you were being hilarious.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.200
 That is incredibly old.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.800
 Yeah, that is wildly not-

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.360
 Active do.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.000
 Pro to call.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.320
 Wow.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.160
 But yeah, set up a nice Discord.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.880
 People have been asking for Patreon.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.720
 So we won't live with it.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.920
 So that we can keep doing this forever.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.160
 Well, that's a bold promise.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.480
 I don't know.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.360
 I mean, at the very least we're going to die, right?

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.480
 We'll pass the torch to the next Sis X Dumpster crew.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.960
 They'll live on forever.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.720
 Now, our apprentices and proteges,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.120
 are they, are we going to find them in our Discord?

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.760
 Yeah.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.080
 Part of-

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.040
 According to the prophecy.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.840
 They'll be revealed.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.160
 Right.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.640
 Yeah.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.680
 Through IRC.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.200
 Through IRC.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.400
 In a series of trials.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.880
 Yes.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.400
 Involving telnet.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.840
 It's like a hacker challenge.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.040
 Fuck, we're nerfed.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.920
 Yeah, Patreon.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.880
 It's live.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.560
 This will be the first episode, I guess,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.520
 that we'll talk about it.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.200
 Expect to hear us talk about it a lot.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.680
 Every episode moving forward.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.000
 Yeah.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.200
 We're going to do cool shit.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.000
 Cool shit.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.440
 We have some goals for the first 25 people.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.920
 Goals.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.800
 We're going to give out some swag.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.360
 Do we need to explain what swag is?

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.200
 It's like an estimate on how long a project will take.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.800
 Mental health.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.920
 I'm sorry.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.560
 Cut that too.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.120
 I'm damnate.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.600
 Good.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.800
 That was a downer.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.520
 Ugh.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.480
 It's a real downer.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.120
 But, okay, people know it's swag is.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.840
 I hope so.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.400
 Yeah.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.280
 It's shit we all get.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.120
 It's stuff.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.560
 We got some nice like beer koozies.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.520
 What else do we have?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.240
 Stickers.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.600
 We got stickers.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.160
 Stickers.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.160
 I'll throw in some, some of my used panties.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.240
 Whoa.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.240
 There's one person from Finland that I think I know stickers too still, but um,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.880
 fucking international shipping.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.880
 I'm just like, I don't want to fill out the form.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.440
 Yeah.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.280
 I don't want to like be it in the post office.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.000
 Plus it's still gonna cause like 20 fucking bucks.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.880
 That's yeah.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.160
 I don't think it's too bad if you can put just like double the amount of stamps

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.760
 and get shit to a lot of places.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.680
 Yeah, especially for this, which I would do just like,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.640
 like two stickers, nothing else.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.040
 You know.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.160
 But sorry person who's info, I forget.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.520
 Stickers are coming your way.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.720
 We kind of just let our patreons, potential patreons, know that,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.640
 we're not going to send them shit.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.760
 Well, that's on me.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.640
 That's my failing.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.000
 My name's Dave.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.720
 Yeah.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.720
 Swag at the 25 mark.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.920
 Wait, 25 users mark.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.520
 25 not patreon mark.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.840
 Right.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.920
 So how much does it cost to join our patreon?

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.120
 Five dollars a month.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.080
 Is that US dollar?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.960
 US dollars.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.280
 The cup of one small coffee at Starbucks.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.160
 Yeah.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.600
 Can get you such great content.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.640
 From us three nerds.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.960
 It's true.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.760
 It's true.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.120
 Endless content.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.920
 It's not endless.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.760
 We're not Q&A discussions.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.400
 It's a little eventually.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.280
 Discord.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.760
 It's true.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.080
 Uh, we're going to upload the music that we do every episode

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.080
 as MP3's to discord.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.080
 You mentioned the sample pack idea.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.360
 Sample packs.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.800
 We could set that as a 50 subscriber mark.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.840
 Oh, okay.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.200
 You're something if you're in that.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.000
 I'm down.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.280
 If we reach 50, I'll throw in two used pairs of panties.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.600
 Damn.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.920
 Couple loose cigarettes.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.920
 Some patch cable.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.720
 Well worn.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.680
 A faulty stackable.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.680
 A faulty stackable.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.480
 A random dope for a panel.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.720
 I think I cut my last,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.120
 I think I threw away my last OG stack cable a couple of weeks ago.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.480
 All right.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.760
 RIP shitty cable.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.640
 I still have a few.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.040
 I still do.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.320
 They're functional.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.800
 Every few of this second time that work.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.200
 Yeah.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.600
 First one.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.880
 They cut in and out, but yeah.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.320
 Not the yellow ones.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.600
 All my yellow ones are dead.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.400
 But whatever reason, that was the one that like within weeks,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.680
 so mine broke.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.240
 Well, I hope you held onto them so that we can give them away.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.720
 Nah, I threw them.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.920
 This picture of the paper.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.400
 All the time.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.040
 I love this.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.560
 Our little podcasting station here is getting invaded by spiders.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.080
 Which is pretty cool.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.440
 Oh, but yeah.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.320
 So everyone joined.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.200
 I just assume they to find it, they just go to patreon.com and then search for us.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.200
 Slash Cisex dumpster.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.160
 Oh yeah.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.680
 I'll put a link on the website too.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.400
 Nice.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.560
 I feel like we should give something special.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.200
 Undisclosed to the first subscriber.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.600
 Oh, like I'll put a blink tag on the link.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.920
 Yeah.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.600
 Oh, hack into your browser.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.040
 He used this browser extension to modify this first link to put a blink tag.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.680
 Give him a link.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.440
 Actually take your credit card info.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.840
 You create a special role in this course for the first person.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.320
 Okay.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.280
 Get the ball rolling.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.840
 I don't think we sold this.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.760
 I mean, the use panties is a pretty good.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.680
 That's a full core press.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.960
 I mean, that's a good deal for $5 a month.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.280
 Right.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.640
 I mean, I usually sell those for at least 80 bucks easy.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.120
 Right.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.640
 And you only get one pair.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.160
 Like it's not like you give those out every month.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.640
 Right.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.440
 To all of our subscribers.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.160
 Like don't.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.440
 No, I buy one pair of underwear and wear it for a month.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.240
 And then I give it to a purchaser.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.680
 That's fair.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.520
 And I'm giving it away for free this time.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.880
 That's savings you can't pass on.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.680
 Yeah, it's a big savings.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.280
 You're leaving money on the table.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.080
 And they're sad.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.920
 Can people pick color?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.080
 Or just just you get it.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.040
 It's all black.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.520
 Okay.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.000
 It's all I wear.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.480
 It's all I wear.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.120
 That's a color.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.680
 Yeah.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.400
 That's not true.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.360
 I know.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.920
 Okay.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.120
 I did want to get to a thing there.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.520
 It's the absence of color.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.800
 Or the presence of all colors,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.480
 depending on which view you want to take.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.600
 Deep.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.040
 So you can get on our discord

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.600
 and you can yell at us about things like.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.840
 Yeah.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.520
 What is black?

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.240
 Is it a color?

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.240
 Is it all colors?

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.920
 Is it no colors?

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.640
 I don't think there's a prize for that,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.520
 but we'd like to know.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.760
 We also have a dope for memes channel.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.800
 It's true.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.000
 I mean, bring your best deeter dope for memes.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.440
 Steaming hot dope for memes.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.080
 Yeah.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.040
 I think we sold it.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.600
 Yeah.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.240
 Yeah.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.720
 Yeah.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.680
 I mean, that would be super merch.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.400
 I'm going to do.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.960
 I don't know.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.680
 It'll evolve.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.240
 Hopefully.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.120
 Hopefully we'll get to a weird merch

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.840
 and give away weird things because that's fun.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.360
 People always ask why we haven't done a Patreon.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.000
 This is why.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.560
 This right.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.720
 And they're like, don't know what to offer.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.800
 Um, shut out to people on Modwiggler though,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.240
 for giving us some good feedback.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.200
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.920
 Yeah, this is something we've kind of like talked about for a while

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.560
 and then dragged our feet on and then that latest episode,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:22.880
 "Bread."

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.800
 There's a lot of discussion and I think that's what pushed us over the edge

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.320
 and actually made us want to do it so.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.280
 Yeah, the moderators didn't move.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.520
 Are thread this time?

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:33.760
 Yeah.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.000
 The Eurorack, you know, sub form that we've been posting in for years now.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.920
 Like they did with the previous episode for some reason.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.240
 There's a lot of users were encouraging us to do something that we've been

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.280
 dragging our feet on.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.400
 Yeah.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.240
 So we appreciate the final push.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.680
 Dip in our toes in the water, see what the deal is here.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.720
 Definitely be nice.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.120
 Help us, you know, afford modules to review in these trying times.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.520
 Price increases.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.400
 Because we don't get this shit for free.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.000
 No.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.360
 We pay for it like everyone else.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.720
 We don't get no C6 dumpster discount.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.920
 We're not influencers.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.040
 Yet.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.360
 Yet.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.840
 Would gladly take some though.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.240
 Take some sponsors.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.840
 I mean, who are we looking for?

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.240
 Like car dealerships, local banks, like what sponsorship money are we looking for?

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.120
 What are we courting?

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.440
 Let's take some free pizza.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.400
 Oh, that'd be nice.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.440
 Like antacids.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.160
 Dissponsored by Tums.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.760
 Stop, stop giving shit the cuckoo.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:38.720
 Cuckoo.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.400
 Cuckoo-cuckoo.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.960
 Cuckoo-choo.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.040
 Now send it our way.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.320
 We'll put it through its paces.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.960
 We will.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.760
 Yeah.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.120
 And you won't have to see our faces.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.280
 Well, at least not drawing those reviews.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.280
 We won't do the little weird mirror.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:51.600
 Yeah.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.320
 That could be a perk.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.600
 Nobody will do it, but send us a thing or review the thing.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.760
 I'm into that.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.960
 But the problem though is I don't think any of us are capable of flying

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.360
 either to ourselves or to our listeners.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.600
 So it's going to be brutally honest.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.400
 It's fine.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.600
 Well, I'm just letting people know.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.640
 I think people know if they expect that from us at this point.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.280
 Yeah, but if we're not going to chill for anything.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.520
 Right, but that's the problem with your product and you want to get some hype going.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.560
 We're not going to help with the hype.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.800
 That said, we will give an honest review.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.600
 Like a certain someone tried to do recently with us.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.440
 Needles say they backed out of the deal.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.120
 They went with the Underhand Soft Pitch podcast.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.680
 It was like, tell me more about everything you want to talk about.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.960
 Should we mention what that was?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.680
 I don't know.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.240
 I don't know.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.520
 We've got like times passed.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.760
 I'm like, I'm going to say no because fuck giving them even a mention.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.160
 Okay.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.480
 Fair.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.280
 Fair enough.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:51.760
 Fair fair.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.720
 It's not even worth it.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.520
 But yeah, it's worth mentioning to the listeners at least that someone tried to get

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.320
 us to show for them.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.640
 When we offered to give it a fair review, they pulled out.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.600
 Yeah, anytime like an agency like that contacts you,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.320
 it's probably going to be a bad time.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.520
 You know, like that's a sign.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.800
 And then they fucking put like even my personal email,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.400
 I think on their fucking mailing lists.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.080
 It was like, I started getting spam and we started getting spam for their

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.880
 fucking agency.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.760
 It's like, come on.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:26.880
 It was interesting though to see that aspect of the scene, I guess.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.360
 The business.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.240
 It is a business.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:28.560
 Yeah.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.880
 So I was wondering, like, you know, when you see these people like

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.520
 shilling for products and like, how does that come about?

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:43.600
 You know, like we just witnessed how it harassed by a marketing agency for that person to try and

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.640
 hype up a product.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.960
 It was all in the format you would expect.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.800
 It was very sort of like very professional.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:55.120
 As I legally is and it's it's, this is the business side of how that manufactured hype

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.040
 comes into existence and money is changes hands and like.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.040
 I guess it says something for us that we've made it to the point where

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.280
 some of these agencies feel like we could be a prospect.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.640
 It was cool in that way.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.120
 I just wish they like kind of would have applied too.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.280
 Because yeah, I write like fucking emails for a job.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.560
 I'll write dozens of emails every week and like I replied like fairly, but like,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.120
 you know, in our like no nonsense way and I would have like just a fucking response.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.920
 Just like a no.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.680
 I don't think it's going to work.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.120
 Can I be like, sweet.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.000
 I don't give a fuck.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.600
 It's a shame that you would you, I don't know, this is me being naive,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.280
 but like just saying we're going to do something fair, if your product is good,

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.520
 it should stand up the rigors of us putting it through its paces.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.080
 I think it was pretty clear that they weren't looking for people to review their right,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:50.000
 right, they were targeting people and then cherry picking who seemed like they were willing to

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.040
 play ball with them the best and just hyping it.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.080
 And I guess like reviewing it or putting through its pace.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.120
 And I guess there's no reason to take a chance on us when there's someone out there that

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.400
 will just simply do what they say.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:10.720
 So the hint is that it's an extremely expensive box that really doesn't make any sound

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.800
 to be used at shows.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.760
 That's probably too much.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.120
 No, it's enough.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.680
 Fuckin' kiss.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.040
 But if you missed or guessed that, the first person to guess it, I'll send a can koozy and

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.360
 some stickers to like the word koozy.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:23.760
 Yeah.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.880
 Fuckin' hate that word.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.200
 Join our Discord, join the discussion.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.520
 Yeah.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.280
 Give us your guesses.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.160
 Give us your guesses.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.760
 Now only one guess.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.720
 Don't just spam it with like every possible like, is it one of these?

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.680
 Be reasonable.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.400
 Yeah, come on.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.720
 That's the other thing we were going to offer is like polls or discussion.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.360
 Oh yeah.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.000
 Oh, polls.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.760
 So like, what do you say?

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.120
 People want us to...

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.920
 Spell what you're saying.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.600
 P-O-L-L.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.720
 P-A-H-L-E-S.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.680
 It sounds like you're saying "pools P-O-L-S."

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.640
 It's the same word.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.400
 P-O-O-L-S and P-O-L-L-S.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.400
 I mean, it means different things and it's a different spelling, but it's the same pronunciation, correct?

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.680
 No, what's P-O-L-E-S.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.160
 Polls.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:04.640
 Polls.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:04.800
 What is that?

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.160
 There's polls and polls.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.520
 You're saying the same thing.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:07.840
 Yeah.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.360
 Am I saying the same thing?

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.320
 No, you're not.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.360
 You're saying different thing.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.800
 Poll and pool.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.360
 Yes, yes.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:13.760
 Thank you, Nick.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.720
 That was it.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.360
 What?

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.120
 You guys are saying the same thing?

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.840
 No, Nick.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.480
 They also do it.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.640
 Like, they're different words and they're pronounced differently.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.880
 No, you're shittin' with me.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.920
 Nick, do it again.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.880
 Polls.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.440
 Polls.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.080
 Totally different.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.320
 Yeah.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.440
 Well, I'm trying to say P-O-L-L.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.480
 We're not just gonna give our listeners a swimming pool.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.520
 No.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:37.840
 Okay.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.600
 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to distract it with...

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.120
 I'm questioning everything.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.640
 Oh, do you do it with a...

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.920
 Is it a cooler?

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.400
 D-A-W-N, say that.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.360
 Don.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.080
 D-O-N.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.560
 Don.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.280
 Yeah, you do it too.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.640
 Same thing.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.120
 They're not.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.760
 They're not the same, I think.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.400
 No, they're not.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.480
 They're supposed to be pronounced differently.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:02.960
 Really?

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.680
 It's a Pittsburgh, Eastern, Pennsylvania thing that we all say.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.400
 I do it too.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.360
 Don and Don.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.000
 Yeah.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.240
 That...

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.600
 That one.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.120
 Now, this one fucks me up.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.040
 Don and Don is fucking me up right now.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.760
 Dantan.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.920
 Yeah, this is supposed to be different words.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.400
 I'm sitting here.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.440
 I'm gonna start smoking.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.360
 I still think poll and polls the same pronunciation.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.480
 I'm not picking up...

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.240
 That one now.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.200
 How to say it differently.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.240
 Don and Don fucks with me.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.680
 Don and Don fucks with me too.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.760
 That was something I learned recently, but...

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.720
 This is the first time I've heard...

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.240
 Polls?

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.120
 Oh, ooh.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.680
 Yeah.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.640
 Polls and polls.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:34.640
 Polls.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.600
 Polls.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.160
 Polls.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:36.960
 Polls.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.840
 Polls.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.200
 Polls?

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.640
 I'm confused.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.040
 Okay, so you're talking about...

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.400
 Discord.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:44.880
 On Discord.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.200
 Polls.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.040
 B-O-L-L-S.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.080
 That aren't full of...

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.560
 pudding or slime.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.040
 But like...

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.120
 Or chlorine.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.600
 Or chlorine.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.080
 Or chlorine.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.440
 Yeah, but like the polls where people vote on

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.800
 topics of discussion...

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.080
 I didn't mean to call you out and make you self-conscious about this break.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.040
 I'm not talking about it.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.400
 My mind is slightly blown.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.280
 I think we all learned a lot today.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.560
 Come on, jump in the pool.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.680
 And get involved in the pool.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.920
 So what were our polls be about?

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.320
 You know, sexy stuff.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.520
 Voting on topics of discussion for future episodes.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.160
 Things like that.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:26.640
 Mm-hmm.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.120
 Yeah.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.720
 Yeah, that too.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.760
 Yeah.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.840
 Are we going to set them with polls?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.240
 Or are we going to let people sort of make their own?

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.840
 No, we set the polling...

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.400
 We set them in polls.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.600
 Not where the admins were there.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.160
 Yeah.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.200
 Cool than Iron Fist.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.520
 Can't let things go fucking topsy-turvy now.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:41.680
 Right.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.480
 Right.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.120
 Chaos.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.920
 Lower the fly-shade.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.360
 Flys mering a bumblebee.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:45.840
 Right, right.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.960
 Cat sleeping with dogs.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.960
 You know, gotta be order.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.320
 Wow.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.240
 This is a Microsoft poll generator.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.280
 XP.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.720
 Wow.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.880
 We just dove into fascism like so quickly.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.280
 Just like day zero fascism.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.560
 Join our discord where we roll with an Iron Fist.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.280
 We're Americans.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.080
 I mean, geez.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:08.640
 I'm sure I am.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.040
 Don't hop in there thinking you're going to tell us what to do.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.320
 [laughs]

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.320
 [laughs]

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.400
 So Techno and synthesizers.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.760
 The Sherman is distracting.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.840
 It is a beautiful Sherman compact sitting on the table.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.240
 It is.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:28.800
 It's pretty.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.640
 It's not mine.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.280
 It's nicks.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.480
 Letting Greg borrow it.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.280
 I'm going to steal it.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.000
 I'm going to steal it for a little.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.520
 But that tip though, holy shit.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.480
 That's a good tip.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:38.880
 Worked up.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.400
 Yeah, trigger that fucking thing.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.040
 What is it?

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.360
 Like blast it with the 16th note on the trigger in.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.000
 And it keeps the envelope high all the time.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.880
 And it's kind of nice.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.560
 You're not as dependent on the input level

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.960
 and how that kind of works through it.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.160
 It really opens it up differently, totally.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.920
 I forget who which Techno producer like made that video.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.840
 But it was a good video.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.920
 So it's a lot of fast short gates or going to be one long gate.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.640
 Just fast short.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.880
 Like a 16th pattern or whatever.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.560
 And you can have fun with it too.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.680
 But it's nice just to keep it up there.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.240
 Not have to depend on the envelope follower.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:14.880
 Gotcha.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.680
 A little shaky at times.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.480
 Yeah.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.520
 Yeah, it can.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.120
 Sometimes it can fool you.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.880
 If your input level changes, you'd be like,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.480
 what's happening a little?

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.880
 Sound very, very different.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.480
 And this kind of changes that a little.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.000
 Turns into an offset more so.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.200
 So Greg, this isn't your first time with the shrimps.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.960
 No, it's been a while though.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.520
 Last time I used one for recording

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.960
 was with the Mecha album,

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.800
 which was like what?

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.800
 Four or five years ago at this point?

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.600
 My fourth.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:43.840
 Wow.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.240
 Really?

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:44.640
 Which one?

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.120
 Oh.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.480
 You had the tall one, right?

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.520
 I had the desktop version.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.560
 Desktop two, yeah.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.520
 Mark two.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:49.920
 Okay.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.000
 And it was pretty much always

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.640
 and just connected to my LXR.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.960
 Oh yeah.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.360
 Yeah.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.840
 I spent a lot of time with the LXR on the Sherman.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.280
 Yeah, LXR Sherman's like,

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.320
 P's and carrots.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.600
 Yeah, and an 808 sounds fucking amazing through it.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.640
 This time around while borrowing yours,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.120
 I plan on running the poly and play through it.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:17.840
 Oh, cool.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.720
 I'll see what kind of shenanigans I can do.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.880
 It was six years ago.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.160
 Six years ago.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.680
 The Mecha Simulacrum,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.040
 or Mecha Simulacra was released by underground record sensation.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.000
 I think of records.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.200
 I got records.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:35.920
 Six years ago.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.720
 2016.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.560
 Cool.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.440
 It's been a long time.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.720
 Yeah, it's been a while.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.040
 So yeah, I'm excited to play with Sherman again.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.160
 And it's nice.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.160
 How compact the compact is.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:48.880
 It is.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.840
 It's very compact.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.400
 Well, this is the second.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.000
 This is the Rev 2, right?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 It's pretty much Rev 3.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.320
 Okay.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.800
 Because the first one is a little bit like chunkier than that.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.320
 Yeah, this is the OG chunky.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.760
 And they did the Rackmount one.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.080
 And then the Mark 2 of the OG chunky.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.560
 Those are all through whole.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.560
 This one is the first surface mount,

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.440
 I think, which is why I got it to be so compact.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.760
 It's the second one I got because the first one

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.560
 seemed like it kind of fucked up because of the inputs,

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.880
 which is why I hadn't used much of the input

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.560
 outside of the signal input for a while.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.720
 Because I triggered an ADSR once and it kind of like

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.640
 seemed to totally freak out.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.200
 Yeah.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.800
 And they sent me another new one.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.440
 And that's been fine since.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.720
 I guess we should specify we're talking about the Sherman filter bank.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.280
 We've just been calling it the Sherman as we tend to do.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.840
 But that Sherman does make other things.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.360
 But does anyone care?

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.160
 But yeah.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.480
 Like, I'm not trying to be a jerk.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.000
 But literally, the filter rank is what I associate with Sherman.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.240
 Yeah.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.560
 I would love to find one of those.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.680
 Was it the Rodeck?

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.400
 I think it was all--

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.040
 Rodeck restylers.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:55.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.200
 I would love to get my hands on one,

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.000
 but they're just like,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.480
 Unuptaneum swears on the wear.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.120
 They're pretty rare.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.360
 So great.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.480
 What is your plans for this?

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.000
 Like, we make some fucking noise.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.480
 I'm getting noisy again, Dave.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:08.880
 Oh.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.960
 For the last two years, going on three,

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.000
 I've kind of been experimenting with like, granular.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.200
 Yeah.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.480
 And melodic elements and things like that.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.240
 But something kind of clicked on my brain a couple months ago,

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.280
 or I just realized like,

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.600
 I don't want to make pretty sounds right now.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.600
 I don't even want to make necessarily

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.400
 granular or like,

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.640
 atmospheric sounds right now.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.720
 I want to get back to my roots and start

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.240
 right fucking shit up again.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.440
 Just sweaty undies.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.400
 Yeah, just swedgy.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.200
 Just swedgy noise.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.320
 Just full on gabber kicks.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:42.800
 Yeah.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.640
 Layers upon layers of white noise.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.320
 Because that's what's cathartic for me, Dave.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.280
 Yeah, that's fair.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.840
 Got a lot of demons inside, you know?

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.000
 And the only way to unleash them is gabber kicks.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.040
 You are not going to hear any argument from me.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.040
 That is the sound.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.960
 The first sound I hear in the morning,

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.240
 the last sound I hear at night,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.880
 the gabber kicking my head with noise.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:12.240
 Fudysky mastering.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:18.000
 V-A-R-E-S-C-H-I mastering.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.160
 Jot. COOOOMM.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.640
 I'm done with this project and it sounds bad.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.960
 What do I do?

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.840
 How about V-A-S-C-Mastering.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.760
 That's cool.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.800
 Philippe will work with you,

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.680
 to get you where you want your sound to fucking go.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.480
 V-A-R-E-S-C-H-I mastering.com.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.520
 Philippe will help you with your sonic.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.520
 Is you...

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.720
 It's kind of weird for me though,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:01.920
 because this album that I'm working on was initially going to be very melodic.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.760
 And I have an hour's worth of material that I recorded that

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.880
 was getting close to being an album.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.960
 I don't know, I just kind of don't like any of it.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.400
 It's just like my brain shifted and instead of trying to force myself

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:27.120
 to continue with my original plan, I'm just going to go with my gut and see where my creativity takes me.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:32.160
 Which is back to making very ugly sounds.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.200
 That's perfectly reasonable. I'm excited to hear it.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:41.440
 I've been restructuring my entire modular, again, to accommodate this plan.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.240
 Yeah.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.360
 I've been spending the last week or so just feedback patching everything once again.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:47.840
 Oh yeah.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.640
 Yeah, I've had an interesting productive week in that way.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.640
 It's like, I feel like my mental health honestly has not been that great.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.800
 And that's been having me making more music.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:04.560
 And I've been kind of getting back, same to my acid wormhole, very technooid techno

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.920
 shit that isn't as melodic.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.440
 And it's more just like, I'm really loving the Neapro Metamorph.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.560
 I've been really loving that and like tempted to get a second one.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.360
 But I've just been using a switch to get eight steps out of it instead.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.000
 It'd be cool to have like eight steps of the three lanes because like the glide is super fucking sweet.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.240
 But so you dove right into that.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.440
 Can you take a step back?

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.760
 What is this and explain how you're using it?

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.760
 It's the Neapro Metamorph sequencer from the Ukraine,

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.560
 which is not necessarily new, but is relatively new to me.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.800
 And I really like it.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:42.400
 Just it kind of stepped in for the Surge Seagate XL that I sold,

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.800
 which was eight steps by two rows.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:50.320
 A little less fun, a lot less fun actually than the Neapro, which I think is a lot better.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.120
 But it's four step, which is limited.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.920
 But for the stuff I'm working on, it's kind of perfect because it's like

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.800
 sometimes it's just about shifting parameters slowly over time too.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.400
 And like getting stuff to breathe a bit.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.320
 Breathing is a big thing right now.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.360
 That's where I'm focused.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.480
 It's always for me too.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.400
 Like just having shit like...

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.640
 And like, I mean music is the space between the notes and like having that sort of like letting

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.160
 things open up and yeah.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.560
 Very special glide circuit on that thing though.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:18.800
 Yeah.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.880
 Very interesting to me what it does.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.440
 I don't have a Neapro, but I've definitely been focusing on breathing lately.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.280
 Within the sound.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:33.600
 One thing when I had my over-stair modular channel

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.840
 that I really like to do is just extreme compression settings.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:45.680
 And running filthy things through it that were at very, very low levels.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:52.480
 But having the over-stair at very, very high gain staging and compression to like

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:58.640
 kind of suck some of the strange ambience of like the circuits in my modular,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.200
 bring the little background noises to the forefront.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.440
 Right.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.320
 You know what I mean?

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.640
 And like having those sounds breathe.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.640
 And that's kind of what I'm getting back to lately.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.200
 I don't have the modular channel anymore, but I've been utilizing like

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.520
 compression and just like envelope followers and things like that to

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.120
 make the noise breathe.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.160
 You know what I mean?

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.600
 To make the textures kind of have space and not just brick walled noise right now.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:25.600
 Yeah.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:25.600
 Right.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.160
 Yeah.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:32.640
 I'm experimenting a lot with like layering textures of breathing noise basically.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:39.520
 Kind of ventured away from granular and trying to focus more on like breathing textures.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.920
 So it's interesting that you use that work because it's like exactly what I've been focusing on too.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.720
 That's cool.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.280
 Yeah.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.080
 Not a lot of the maestro from acid rain.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.000
 I've been loving that thing.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.160
 That's been helping a lot with that too because it's so easy just to get beat synced.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:00.320
 Modulations and it's really easy to like think of something and make it happen pretty quickly.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.200
 That's been key.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.840
 And the mod Medusa, which I just got, which I'll talk about sometime.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.080
 But you can talk about it now if you want to talk about it now.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.240
 Yeah.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:08.560
 Yeah.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.120
 I've only had it like two or three days ago.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:18.640
 It showed up the mod Medusa from ShackMat, which is the quote unquote Euclidean modulator or whatever they call it.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.840
 But it's like an LFO.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.880
 And it's actually at first a little confusing like some of the ShackMat things can be.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.040
 And then when I looked into it, it's kind of one of their simpler ones in a way because it's just like

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.600
 four outputs for one modulator.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.160
 And you get like, what are the controls on length, which is the length of the sequence of Euclidean

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.520
 shit that happens.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.600
 And you can do non Euclidean stuff too.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.360
 There are four modes for that.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.840
 But anyway, the top knob is length.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.720
 You get one through eight steps and you can CV that and change it.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.040
 The cool thing like overall about this module is you don't need to even really fucking know what's going on.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.840
 It's like really, you can kind of intuit what you're going to hear by like twisting all the knobs.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.120
 It's really fun to play.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.120
 It was one of the most fun things I've used in a while, especially modulator.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.800
 It replaced the Mark III Kermit for me, which was cool, but the end to the cyst of what that module is.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.520
 And it was like, it's not menu diving at all.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.880
 It's very surface.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.480
 I really want a second one.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.040
 So when you say you're twisting these knobs, are you changing waveform shapes?

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.800
 What are you controlling?

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.240
 There are four really, I think there's length of the sequence.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:22.960
 There's density.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.600
 So that's Euclidean density number of events, basically within that length of sequence,

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.040
 which determines how things happen.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.320
 And then you have like two shaped knobs in the bottom left.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.240
 I forget one is what the fuck is it?

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.840
 It's something shape and then.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.400
 Symmetry.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.040
 Symmetry.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.960
 So it's kind of like the four milliseconds peg in a way, which I fucking love.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.480
 And I've had since I built one like 10 years ago now, since they came out.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.160
 And it's kind of like that, but it does like crazier sequences.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.160
 I really love playing it.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.240
 You can do like crazy noise shit with it.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.400
 Like I just had some of those samples you heard, which was just like going into the piston Honda.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.280
 No VCA, just direct with like a reverb at the end of it.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.520
 So I could like tolerate listening to it for a minute.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.920
 And that was fun.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.840
 You can do like crazy break core shit.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.600
 It's all going to take a clock.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.640
 There's a tap input.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.680
 There's also this P sync input, which is cool because that will sync the peaks of the waveform

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.480
 instead of the troughs to the clock.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.760
 So you can kind of like shift that.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.600
 There's also these length buttons on the right where you can shift the sequence forward and

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.840
 back in time by a step, which is cool.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.960
 I got a question about the peaks.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.600
 Yeah.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.760
 Does it have zero crossing as it moves those or are you getting like clicks?

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:36.880
 Never click.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.520
 Yeah.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.280
 It's always like zero crossing, basically.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:39.760
 Oh, nice.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.600
 I haven't heard it do a click at all.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.480
 That was amazing.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:42.800
 Nice.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.600
 Totally warranted.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:43.760
 Yeah.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.400
 It's smooth as fuck even at high speeds.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.160
 What the fuck else was going to say?

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.120
 Oh, it's got two inputs.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.280
 I haven't even used these yet, but there's like a gate input or VCA input,

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.560
 which is just like controlling a VCA of one of the outputs.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.360
 So I think you get like level control and you're going to sign that.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:05.920
 Which would be very nice because for modulators, they typically don't have that on board.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:12.800
 Like if you wanted to squash an LFO or any kind of what's considered like a modulation source,

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.000
 typically got to run it through an attenuator or a ten new version.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.400
 Totally.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.520
 That's a pretty clever idea.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.160
 Yeah.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.240
 Then there's another gate input where you can do like ratcheting and some other things

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.160
 with that sequence too, which is cool.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.800
 And then there's another mode you can get into where you've got like these four outputs,

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.120
 right?

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.880
 They're kind of like all, we'll talk about the four buttons on the right,

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.400
 which are main compute random and phase.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.240
 So that's how the four outputs behave.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.280
 Main is just like playing the sequence back and it kind of like has some rules for how it

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.560
 represents each of the outputs.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.080
 I forget it's in the manual.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.600
 It's a little detailed to remember anyway.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.080
 Compute does logical operations.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.320
 Like it does, I think, and an or maybe it ores to the outputs together.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.720
 So it's like, okay, here's the logical operation for that.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.160
 Random has some randomization rules that you can pick from,

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.720
 just kind of like randomize it and phase is just phase difference of the main waveform.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.840
 So you get those four to select from and then you can go to a mode where you can select each

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.600
 output and change all those parameters for each one too.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.800
 I haven't even used that yet.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.640
 I've just been treating them all as like four bound together things.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.600
 You can kind of decouple them now and just have individual changes to those things.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.800
 So it's super capable.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:30.480
 It's like really like some of those things where you can get it out of the box, plug it in and

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.000
 it's just fun immediately too.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.640
 And you can just start to hear like, oh, that's what it does.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.520
 You know, it's like kind of like triangle stuff.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.840
 You can change the symmetry and the shape, not triangle, but you get a few waveforms.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.960
 Yeah, I wanted to ask about that.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.960
 Like what kind of shapes are we talking about here?

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.240
 They're pretty basic, really.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.080
 It's like, I think square saw and then reverse saw.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.640
 So it's kind of like four milliseconds peg saw.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.360
 You don't get much fancy like wave table or any like ability to modify that,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.440
 but you could CV control over everything.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.520
 So you can see the symmetry in the shape.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.800
 Yeah, you can shape those sort of symbol forms into something a little bit more unusual,

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.720
 which I think if it did much more than that, it might be a little weird.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.080
 It's kind of nice to have it because it's such a basic thing anyway.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.920
 You can really kind of intuit what you're going to get, which I like.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.760
 So it's like super fun.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.880
 It sounds great when you CV the fuck out of it.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.680
 Like it's like classic, I think it's definitely,

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.120
 if I would have to pick like module of the year for me at this point.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:35.200
 And you're very strong modules, I'll say, with things like the consolation and stuff like that.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.000
 But it's like, just, I don't know, something about it clicked with me as a modulator immediately,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.360
 and I could use another.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.560
 And that made you kick the Kermit to the curb.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:44.880
 Yes.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.880
 Yeah, that was quite a sacrifice.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.880
 Same size.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.880
 Same size.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.200
 In my head, I really wanted to say, kick the Kermit to the curb.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.640
 Because it was too divey.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.400
 Oh, for me, it's just too divey.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.000
 It was really cool, but I hated using it.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.080
 Yeah, I got from Toman.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.520
 Toman fucking kicks ass.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.040
 Got it to me in like 36 hours or some shit like that.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.440
 Nice.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.080
 It's insane to me how fast.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:08.480
 Yeah.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.080
 Toman and Schneider, Schneider-laden can get things here.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.200
 In signals faster than perfect circuit can.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:15.840
 Yeah.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.800
 I thought to that list.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.160
 I've gotten things from both blocks.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.120
 Take an ass later.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:19.520
 Yeah.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.200
 And stuff that I've gotten from like, Kansas, have taken like a week.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.200
 It's really mind-blowing.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.240
 I don't understand it.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:31.040
 There's been a few things that I haven't been able to find in shops and stateside.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.360
 And so I've, yeah, I've been ordering overseas and legit.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:41.680
 Like every time it's gotten to me faster than usually the domestic resellers that I go through.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.880
 It's routinely more expensive though.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.840
 Barely.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.240
 Oh, right.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.520
 Like I think the last thing I got, I can't remember for Schneider's with Toman,

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.240
 but like it was like 10 bucks to ship.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.120
 That's not bad.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:57.760
 It was just like the same as UPS or USPS priority at this point.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.000
 Right.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:58.320
 Right.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.520
 This last time was cheaper than getting it stateside because the Euro.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.800
 Because it's insane too.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.360
 It's wild.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:03.680
 Yeah.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.600
 So it's weird.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.120
 Yeah, but fucking two thumbs up love the module.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.360
 And that too bipolar.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.400
 Yeah.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.280
 That's kind of nice.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.560
 Yeah, it's got a smidge for it too.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:14.960
 Nice.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.160
 I thought I was overseeing that.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.240
 So you can actually switch it like rectify it.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.360
 Let me double check that.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.320
 I'm pretty sure you're there's like a uni switch as that one it is.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.000
 Yeah.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.120
 Is it a polar button?

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:25.760
 Oh, nice.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.320
 Okay.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.440
 Kind of like rectify it.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.760
 You can see everything.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.440
 Killer.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.080
 Fucking love it.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.360
 Yeah.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.320
 Shack-man rules.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.320
 I love the rock too.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.200
 I was like really like, um, they're good at sequencing.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:39.840
 Shit like that.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:40.880
 It's just really fun.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.280
 I don't know.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:41.920
 What's the rock?

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.960
 I figure which one that is.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.960
 Oh, the, um, bishops.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.160
 What the fuck is it called?

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.160
 Yeah, the rock.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.640
 It's like the bishops gamut or something like that.

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.560
 That's a different bishops, Messalini.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.680
 That's another one.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.640
 They disconnect.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.280
 Continue it.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.160
 They're all chess moves.

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:56.720
 It turns out.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.160
 I like chess things.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:58.560
 Yeah.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.040
 The only one I have in them is the the dole dagger.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.240
 And I still like it.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.280
 Dole dagger is awesome.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.080
 I built one of those.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:04.960
 Great filter.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.920
 Sounds amazing.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.040
 Great stereo filter.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.160
 Yeah, both.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:08.560
 Yeah.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.160
 I use it mono and stereo.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.680
 Yeah.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.720
 Shaq Matt kicks ass.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.960
 All I have is the Harlecunz context.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.760
 It's yeah, it's the heart of like a live set.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.040
 I used it, um, driving, uh, that set that I had.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:21.520
 No, I had.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.080
 It worked.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.360
 Fucking, it was great.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.160
 So yeah, Shaq Matt.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.600
 Shaq Matt.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.160
 Shaq Matt.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.880
 Yeah.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.200
 Pools.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:29.920
 Pools.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.400
 Pools.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.360
 Pools.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.240
 Yeah.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.440
 So yeah, and though I've been, uh,

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.320
 been trying to like finish a record.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.640
 Um, so I've been recording a bunch of stuff.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.880
 Sort of putting a lot of stuff together.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.240
 Now I'm in the, uh, like, I got a bunch of recordings.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.280
 I'm trying to put them all together.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:50.800
 So it's just time consuming and tedious, which is, you know,

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.320
 it has to be done.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.800
 You know, otherwise it just won't ever finish.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.880
 Um, but that's where I'm at right now,

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.200
 which is a bummer because, uh, this record is like,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.200
 started making it after the last record,

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.720
 which is also when I got the LXR.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:10.160
 So it's also when I started playing, um, my Necrons Army

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.520
 in War number 40K, a lot more than my Black Templers Army.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.320
 Um, so robots,

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.480
 killer robots that destroy humanity and hate all humans.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.920
 That's always been on my mind.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.680
 Like, since I was a kid, but it's like, oh, like really forefront.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.440
 Uh, these last couple of years.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.200
 And so between having the LXR and a bunch of like a lot of digital stuff,

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.080
 really was making a lot of digital sounding stuff.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:36.480
 Yeah.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.200
 So a lot of this recording, a lot of this record is going to be

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.200
 just a lot of like, um, digital sounds, digital controls.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.960
 So there's a lot of like bleeping and blooping.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.040
 Um, which is rad.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.600
 I'm glad I, you know, I'm, I'm on sort of like the last steps

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.760
 and finishing it, but at the same time,

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.760
 I've also gotten into all of the pieces I need for the, uh,

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:01.520
 chaos, Leibniz binary system, which would be perfect.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.960
 Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.440
 Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.000
 Leave established.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.280
 That's what we call them here today.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:07.760
 Well, I'm sorry.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.480
 What is it again?

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.840
 Zach, Zach.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.840
 So I got the Zach, uh, Leibniz binary system.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.160
 I got the first three modules of that.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.640
 I'm not going to start over because I have too much to record it

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.400
 and I'm basically in the final stretch.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:20.800
 Yeah.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.920
 But there's a part of me that's like, fuck, I wish I would have had this

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.360
 when I started.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:25.840
 Yeah.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.120
 It's not new.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.480
 That's the crazy thing about this.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.400
 I've only, I only got, um, turned onto it when I got, um,

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.160
 I got the MOSCA Mark II and I got the expansion for it,

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.080
 the O-Stank Kino.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.320
 And that, and there's a little note in it that says this hooks up to the

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.040
 Zach's Leibniz binary system.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.280
 I'm like, the fuck is this under me?

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.200
 But it's called a binary system, which obviously, oh, what is this?

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.680
 Um, been around since like 2017.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.560
 It's not new.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.360
 No.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.400
 I just did, I just was not aware of it.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.840
 I'm glad someone finally has it.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.520
 I've always been intrigued by that system.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.800
 So I've had it for a couple of weeks.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.560
 I've got the Dresno, the Jana, Gina, J-J-E-N-A.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.000
 Jana?

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.040
 I was calling it Jenna.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:13.440
 Yeah.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.960
 But it's probably, but Jana would be J-N-N-A.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:17.840
 I think it's Jana.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.880
 Jana?

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.280
 Maybe.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.880
 Jana, whatever it is.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.720
 Um, and then the Air Fort.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.880
 So the, like these are, seem to be the sort of three core modules.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.200
 Yeah.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.360
 That supply this, that run the system.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.400
 It's fucking amazing.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.640
 I'll get into it more in a future episode

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.240
 because I've really only got like dive into it.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:39.520
 And I really don't want to do like a show and tell with the two of you and show what it does and everything.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.360
 Opportunity for Patreon Perf.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.480
 It could be a Patreon Perf.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.000
 Technical overview video.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.640
 It could be a video of me in my, uh, this face.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.480
 Subscribe listeners and watch Dave deep dive into the...

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.440
 Leibnets.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.640
 Leibnets.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.480
 I'm assuming it generates streams of gates based on the information.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:56.960
 It's all, yes.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:02.400
 Yes, but it's, um, basically it's an 8-bit representation at a 2 millihertz,

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.760
 uh, processor of an income, either an incoming signal or other data on this Leibnets.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:13.840
 It's a shared system that you can sort of link through them all and either pass on the original data

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.360
 or you get the, the, whatever the modified data was.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:23.600
 Um, or it takes its own input, which can either be CV rate or audio rate.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.200
 Um, and so CV rate stuff, you just generate bonkers.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.040
 It's 8 bits, which translates into 8, uh, gate outputs.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.720
 What's really interesting and the, uh, as I was having a discussion with Russ from Evertan.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:43.040
 And he made the, the, the sort of poignant observation.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.200
 Oh, that sounds like, um, the Turing machine.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.000
 And I sort of chewed on it for a second.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.520
 I'm like, yes, but it's almost like the opposite.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:56.880
 Because if you send it a signal, you're getting those 8 bits.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.880
 Like, that's deterministic.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.520
 It's repeating where Turing machine is basically chaos.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.240
 You're, you're getting this sort of the, the, the bit shifted registers.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.840
 And then eventually you go, oh, I like this.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.560
 And then you, then you lock that into place.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.200
 Right.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.960
 This, as it takes a signal, it's doing the same thing over and over again.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:22.560
 You're getting its transposition of this data, incoming data into this binary representation,

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.080
 which then translates into this 8, 8 gate output.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.480
 If you send it the same signal as you're getting that, that's, that's over and over again.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.560
 As you change that, or as you modified or as you make any sort of changes to that incoming

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.320
 signal, it updates it accordingly.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.320
 So if you like something, you can actually keep it until you make a change.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.280
 Oh, okay.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.000
 Cool.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.920
 And again, that applies to CV.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:51.200
 So, you know, sending a saw wave at a pretty slow rate.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.360
 You can then create really interesting rhythmic grumb sequences just from that.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:03.440
 Or you can send audio rate stuff and use it as a bit crusher or a bit reducer or a wave tape,

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.640
 wave shaper with the, the Gina or Jenna.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:13.440
 Like as you modify that and it takes those eight steps and has a different look up on a,

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.760
 a wave table and modifies the incoming data according to that wave table.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.920
 It then basically you're using your shape.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.240
 You can then use the shape and incoming signal at audio rate.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.400
 Oh, weird.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.800
 Again, that's why I kind of want to do a show and tell because as I'm describing this,

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.280
 I can tell there's a thousand missing pieces.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.040
 I'm not telling you that makes this probably a lot more easy to understand or showing you

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.240
 might make it a lot easier.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:45.680
 Overall though, like sort of like the summary statement of this is I fucking love it.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.800
 I think it's amazing.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.400
 It's like, I think it's brilliant.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:54.240
 Like I really wish I'd been using it for the last three years as part of making this, this record.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.880
 Well, it's not too late to backtrack a little, man.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:03.680
 I feel like some of the stuff that I like turned out happiest with that I've created was stuff that

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.600
 I went back to like that stuff that I totally thought was done.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:07.920
 Yeah.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:14.400
 Sat on it for weeks, months, and then thought to myself like, no, I can do something better with

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:14.880
 this part.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.440
 You know what I mean?

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:15.840
 Yeah.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:21.120
 Usually nine times out of 10, I'm much happier with the end result when I revisit those types

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:21.520
 of things.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.120
 So like you want to be done.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:23.440
 Right.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.320
 You think you're done.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:24.960
 Yeah.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:30.720
 But maybe just sit on it for a minute, you know, and then see where it takes you with the new

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.360
 technique.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.440
 I'm a little bit more, I had an idea when I started this.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:39.840
 I've actuated it and the final stretch, the idea is can evolve.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.640
 That's true.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:46.080
 What I'm thinking is finish this, get this done, and then start over from scratch with

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.680
 blank canvas with this new technique.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:54.000
 Also while I'm doing, you know, while I'm finishing up this record, dive more into this

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.560
 - Sure.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:59.680
 - system, really start to get a toolbox of different techniques and how to use it,

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:04.480
 then hit the ground running with, you know, basically new record.

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.160
 I've done both.

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:06.480
 Right.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:06.800
 Right.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.160
 You know, but I -

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.520
 I'm not unhappy.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.200
 I'm not unhappy with what I made.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:18.160
 You're not unhappy, but you have found something you think is nailing the -

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:18.960
 Oh, absolutely.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.360
 Better.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:19.760
 Yeah.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.000
 Yeah.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.240
 So it's like, yeah, maybe you'll regret later if you release it.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:24.800
 That's what the real -

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.200
 Right.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.240
 - the record is for.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:26.720
 Yeah.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.920
 No, I - I 100% what you're saying though, but this also represents me starting two,

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.640
 three years ago.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.480
 If I drag this out too much longer, that's just not going to be me at all.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.280
 And I'm going to get to the point where I just don't like any of it.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.120
 Like I just reached with the album that I've been working on for two years now.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:43.440
 Right.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.160
 I'm strapping all of it except for maybe one try.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.040
 - Trying to finish our pandemic records all of us.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:49.600
 Yeah.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.480
 Yeah, exactly.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.080
 And what you just described is actually kind of terrifying to me.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.640
 I'm okay with turning my back on my own creations.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:00.640
 I have no problems boarding it, but -

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.200
 Boarding it.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.240
 Is that who you're describing it?

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.040
 Yeah.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.160
 It's my creation.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.520
 No.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.680
 Now, you know, I'm in like -

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:13.360
 Like boarding it like an animal at a shelter or boarding it isn't like a house that you like -

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.000
 A boarding.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.120
 A boarding.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:15.360
 Okay.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.480
 I thought you said boarding it.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:16.560
 I'm not.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.120
 No, no, no.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.600
 Like eating me from the inside out, you know, training my life source.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.120
 I was like, are you just like giving it to a animal shelter to like -

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.280
 It's a little demon clawing its way in my gut.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:31.680
 I'm just getting it out there, making a new baby.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.120
 New techno, baby.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.800
 I can't argue with new techno, baby.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.120
 But like that, yeah, everything about that makes perfect sense.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.880
 But in any case, yeah, I am in the future.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.560
 I'm going to have a lot to say about the system.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.240
 I think it's a really novel, interesting thing that -

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:50.240
 Yeah.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.440
 That's been around for five fucking years.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.800
 I'm only now getting turned on to it.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.200
 So I'm very into it.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.400
 I'm glad you've managed to finish your pandemic album.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:00.880
 Like I -

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.520
 It's like a second.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.480
 This is the second one.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:02.960
 True.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:07.040
 I actually did another one entirely in the pandemic and it was released.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.040
 I mean, I released one, but it was done before the pandemic.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.200
 It just came out during the pandemic, you know, released on back.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.080
 Go records.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.360
 I've heard good things about them.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.920
 But like the one that I've been working on for the last few years,

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.960
 like I was concerned that that would happen.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.880
 Because I was like, I'm feeling a very specific kind of way right now,

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.280
 right in like the year 2020-2021.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.560
 And I was trying hard to capture it and finish it in time.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.760
 And it's gone.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.560
 It slipped for me.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.880
 You know, that feeling, that distinct state of mind that I was in

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.080
 has already shifted a bit.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:46.560
 And now I feel like to pursue that album any further,

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.760
 I'll just be forcing it.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.080
 Right.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.800
 Yeah.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.280
 Yeah.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.640
 What I really want to do.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.520
 So yeah, you know, working on those tracks helped me get through the pandemic.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.720
 That's for sure.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.920
 But yeah, like I don't think those tracks will ever see the light of day.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.160
 It's helped me get to where I am now, though.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.640
 And I'm ready to shift gears.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:05.040
 Right.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:05.360
 Right.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:05.840
 Yeah.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.600
 I've got it down to like four of them from all the stuff I recorded.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.800
 And like two of them remain.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.320
 Two of them are going to be finished.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:12.640
 Yeah.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:16.320
 And then two of them are just like, you're so close, but you're so fucking far.

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:16.480
 Right.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:16.800
 Right.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.280
 Right.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.240
 Working on the stuff, it is so fucking time consuming.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.720
 It really eats up a lot of time finishing a track.

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.680
 Yeah, it does.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.880
 Like it's, I'm going to try to come up with the best word, describe it.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.200
 Making it is fun.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.440
 This is the first time where it feels like not a chore isn't the right word,

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:38.880
 but it is like the thing of like, oh, I could literally do anything else and be more fun than this.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.600
 But like, this is the thing that like pushes this over and actually

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.920
 finishes it, but it's just programming to tedious.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.440
 Yeah, it's very.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.080
 The creation and the exploring and the recording.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.120
 That's the fun part.

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:51.360
 Yeah.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.960
 And all of that stuff is sitting a foot away.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.280
 Yeah.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.560
 So the temptation just.

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.280
 Right.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.200
 Well, let me just turn this on and have fun again.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:46:59.360
 Yeah.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.080
 Like that was fun.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.400
 It has been very strong.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:10.080
 So the shift to VCV rack for me has made that process way simpler.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.320
 So explain that because that's a very interesting point.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:12.640
 Yeah.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.760
 Because right now, like I don't.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.800
 So I'm not in the box at all.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.120
 Yeah.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.520
 Like I have everything is external and right now Ableton is just recording.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:25.040
 And then months later, arranging.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:25.280
 Right.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:25.760
 Yeah.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.320
 Same.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:32.480
 So that disconnect may actually be something that like that what your setup may resolve in a more

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.280
 interesting way.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.400
 Well, it allows me to be able to save a portion of my patch for one thing if I'm doing anything

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.200
 within VCV.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:45.120
 But I'm mainly just talking about being able to multitrack like using the expert sleepers

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.800
 ES9 now and having like multiple expansions.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:54.400
 You know, before I was just like to tracking everything.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:58.720
 Like even though I had a sound card that had multiple inputs, I had to

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:03.280
 bounce everything down through like my mixer or through like the overstair and things like that.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.280
 So I was basically summing everything down.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:13.200
 Like I was doing most of my mixing in the modular and then bouncing out like two stereo tracks or

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.440
 like a maximum of like four stereo tracks.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:15.600
 Right.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.080
 And then like I'd have those tracks and then I'd have to go back and create the other layers on top of that.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:23.200
 You know, it was a big pain in the ass, but I can essentially record everything

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:33.040
 just using the ES9 and the mix master module and VCV and then doing a polyphonic record out

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:38.640
 where like I don't even have to create individual recording tracks.

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.920
 It does it all for you.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.520
 Oh, that's cool.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:47.760
 It's one polyphonic virtual cable that goes from the mixer polyouts group one through eight and then

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.560
 eight through 16.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:56.160
 I hit record on those things and just blow every channel on those mixers as a separate audio track.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:56.800
 That's cool.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.440
 That's awesome.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.240
 All lined up.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:58.560
 Yeah.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:01.600
 Just dropped into my DAW super fast.

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:08.640
 Like it's because yeah, the part that always killed me was the whole like recording the modular

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.520
 and then trying to sync that all up and sure, you know, all that shit.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.720
 It's this kind of speeds that up for me a lot.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.680
 And I finally got a focus right multi-track.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.120
 That's what I had previously.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.720
 And it's made things but I think it makes things a lot easier than what I had,

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:30.240
 which was I did everything on a hardware mixer that stereo out then when that's what I would record.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.320
 So I had to do basically one takes.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:34.640
 Yeah.

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.360
 And like, oh, that didn't sound good or the mix didn't sound right.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.480
 So I had to adjust things.

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.920
 And then if I wanted to add something later, none of that was synced.

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.360
 I'd have to go in and try to find a way to line them up and all that.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.760
 Even the idea of taking what you just described and jamming for like an hour.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.160
 Yeah.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.360
 And just being like, okay, first 45 minutes was terrible.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.640
 I finally hit the stride.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.680
 All of that's right there for you to just pick and pluck out.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.560
 It's fast.

00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:58.960
 Yeah.

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.520
 It's it's helpful to me.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.560
 You know what I mean?

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:07.440
 I know the way that I was recording things you could have been done better,

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.720
 but it's just like I got into a bad habit and that's what I stuck with.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:13.120
 It wasn't the most efficient process.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:18.400
 Swishing to the VCV, I had like a new opportunity to develop a new system.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.920
 A whole new set of bad habits.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.400
 Yeah.

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:20.640
 Right.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.040
 Exactly.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:26.240
 And also like just doing everything from the DAWs that I've used previously,

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:31.120
 mainly FL Studio, like there was always issues with drift and things like that.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.800
 Like even when I was using a click track instead of a midi clock and all that shit,

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:39.600
 there were still certain issues with the multi-tracks, things being a little bit

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:46.880
 drifty shit like that. But now like within VCV rack, like nothing starts until I start VCV.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:54.720
 And it's a rock solid, you know, clock that goes from VCV to the ES9 and then clock's

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.400
 Pamela's workout.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:56.880
 Right.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.280
 And also my Pamela's workout is setting sending the midi out to my other external gear,

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.720
 like poly and play and things like that.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:08.160
 Everything is just like locked tight and it all just gets recorded in sync and it's super smooth.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.000
 Like real happy with the process.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.120
 Your setup sounds amazing, man.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:11.520
 Yeah.

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.640
 Congratulations on.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:12.960
 Thank you.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.120
 Thank you.

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:13.600
 Yeah.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.160
 It's been a lot of trial and error.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.360
 I'm finally happy with the new process.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.240
 Love and VCV.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:25.440
 Except for when it goes Ape Shit because I'm using two different sound aid interfaces.

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.800
 Now it's a good.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.480
 Go Ape Shit in a fun way.

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:28.880
 No.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.440
 Record it.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.120
 It goes Ape Shit in a way where like sometimes it just drops.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.680
 It's not like a sound plus 3.16 going Ape Shit and you go,

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.480
 this sounds really great.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.760
 Let me record this.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.880
 It requires me to control,

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.080
 ult, delete it, kill the task.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.600
 Oh geez.

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.240
 Sometimes.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.200
 How often does that happen?

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.120
 Uh, I don't know.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.720
 It depends on I guess how big the patch is.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.920
 But I've had it happen even with like a bare bones patch.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.360
 Like it's just something with having,

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.640
 I think it's an ES9 problem to be honest.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.880
 I could get interfaces are always a little dicey.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:01.360
 Yeah.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.160
 Like I don't want to blame ES9.

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.560
 I think I just did that.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.480
 But like yeah, I think expert speakers could.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.440
 There was an implied blame.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.840
 Could maybe fine tune the firmware a little bit

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.360
 because sometimes it just gets flaky for no reason.

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.600
 But when it works, it works great.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:18.160
 Yeah, mine.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.520
 I couldn't get rid of the USB,

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.520
 and the headphone amp on it is garbage.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.560
 Never tried the headphone amp.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.120
 It's garbage.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.480
 So I can't speak to that.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:32.160
 I mean, yeah, it wasn't that I could have gone without using the headphone amp ever.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.280
 I think I tried it one time when I first got it

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.440
 and realized he has kind of noisy and didn't touch it back.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.960
 But I don't like using headphone amps in modular anyways.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:46.560
 Like all my WMD pro outputs, they had headphone amps too.

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.280
 And they could get very gainful.

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.640
 And that was kind of the problem.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.280
 Like I get pretty loud within the modular

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:57.120
 and like I have the tendency to blast my fucking ears out.

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:01.040
 So like if I do headphones, it's like after everything is already balanced.

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.920
 Kind of like it's the way you can patch too, if you're trying to like monitor there.

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:03.920
 Yeah.

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.080
 But it's just like I want to overdrive this shit

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.760
 and then like calm it down somewhere upstream or downstream rather.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.760
 Hard left turn.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.480
 Yeah.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.440
 You mentioned WMD.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.320
 We should talk about that.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:23.760
 We're also talking about hybrid systems, which we said 2022 would be the year of the hybrid.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.240
 You did.

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.760
 It's really starting to look that way.

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.560
 It is.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.480
 As the system collapses in a sense for making hardware things,

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:31.520
 yeah.

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:37.520
 WMD being one of the first, well a few of the first casualties sadly.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.280
 This is probably the first major.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.480
 First major, yeah.

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.080
 Definitely the biggest so far.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.560
 Also probably the biggest impact.

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.680
 Yes.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.440
 Because there's, I mean first off we should talk about what we're talking about.

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.160
 Yeah.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:55.520
 So WMD announced at least at the time of this recording a couple of days ago that they are

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.840
 ceasing all operations.

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.000
 They're closing up shop.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.680
 They're stopping manufacturing.

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:05.360
 They have no plans to release any future modules at this time.

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:09.520
 And they're liquidating their current stock at 30% off.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.240
 Which is a hell of a deal.

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:17.840
 I actually ordered two muscle compressors to take advantage of the sale.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:22.640
 I wanted to get a couple of trash masters again, but they were sold out.

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.640
 Do they have any giger pedals?

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.920
 I didn't look at the pedals, but they do have the module and stock.

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.480
 Currently.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.000
 Because I was thinking about getting one of those.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 Yeah.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.480
 I think that's...

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.320
 We'll circle back to the giger counter though.

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.760
 The black ones look so cool too.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.080
 Yeah.

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:34.240
 Yeah.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:34.720
 I really do.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:41.840
 Well, but impact wise, I also follow erogenous tones.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:46.240
 Because they make structure and the guys that are involved in erogenous tones are

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:50.160
 just amazing human beings and very forthcoming in social media.

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:50.720
 Yeah.

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:51.520
 Super cool.

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:51.760
 Yeah.

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.240
 Absolutely nothing bad to say about them.

00:54:54.240 --> 00:55:01.520
 But they address the fact that WMD is what they use to manufacture all the erogenous tones.

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:01.760
 Right.

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.240
 Modules.

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:08.400
 So it's also having an impact on their ability to put modules and stuff out.

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:08.720
 Yeah.

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.720
 Let's take one step back.

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:16.400
 They're not just closing because they're bored or sick of mod.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:22.640
 They're closing due to what they said is the component shortages and cost increases

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:23.760
 and all the things like that.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.080
 So yeah, it's not like they're just randomly shutting their doors.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.200
 Like this is all...

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:29.760
 Let's go point.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.240
 Yeah.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:34.880
 Fall out from the current situation that we've been talking about for a few months now.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:40.720
 In January, we were speculating what kind of impacts we would see throughout 2022

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:46.800
 due to these cost increases and labor issues and component shortages.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.960
 Supply chains and supply chains.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.480
 But I mean, the fact that it's obviously...

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:50.640
 We're finally seeing it.

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.000
 We're finally talking about it.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:52.320
 Yeah.

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.160
 That really says something about the...

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:58.000
 I'm maybe silver lining this.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.600
 Dedication and try to make it happen and try to work through it.

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:01.920
 Sure.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:02.400
 Yeah.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:02.400
 Yeah.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:02.960
 This is...

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:05.360
 They lasted a pretty long time and everyone's lasted.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.720
 Like who's sticking with it.

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.160
 This can't be fucking easy.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:08.800
 It says a lot.

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:09.360
 Yeah.

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.440
 Because WMD is pretty major.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:13.120
 They're one of the first ones on the scene.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:18.320
 They're major and like you said, they also do the manufacturing and like parts

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:21.760
 ordering and all that shit for other companies, other big companies.

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.320
 Arogenous tones, like you said.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:29.600
 I think also like Milleco, SSF.

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:34.320
 I think there was a couple of others off the top of my head.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.640
 They're one of the few full system companies.

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:36.960
 Yeah.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.960
 Companies that make like a full system.

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:39.200
 Right.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.120
 Yeah.

00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.720
 And I mean, and they didn't even start out.

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.720
 Like this isn't just impacting modules either.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:45.040
 Like they...

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.360
 At the heart, they're a pedal company.

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:47.840
 Right.

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.000
 Right.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.040
 You know, that's how they started.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.320
 And not strictly a boutique.

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.880
 We're making five of these pedals and...

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:55.200
 Right.

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.680
 We're going to make money because we're charging a lot for them.

00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.160
 Not the shit on boutique pedals, but like they make...

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.000
 They're that weird...

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:02.800
 Accessible.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.520
 Exactly.

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.920
 That middle area between boutique and...

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.200
 Boss.

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:07.680
 Right.

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:12.320
 Like they are making fantastic high quality pedals and they're making a volume of them.

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.840
 For 17 years now, yeah.

00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:14.000
 Yeah.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:14.800
 That's amazing.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.600
 I remember like seeing a Geiger counter pedal for the first time being like,

00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.880
 "I need one of those someday."

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.200
 Yeah.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.200
 And then like shortly after that,

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:28.320
 they announced that they were making the module of it and I grabbed it.

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.440
 You know, that was one of the...

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:29.680
 Yeah.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:32.560
 I think it was like the third or fourth module that I bought.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.000
 I was going to say you had that way back.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:34.560
 Way back.

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:34.960
 Man.

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.720
 Like I had some of the...

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:40.320
 Like live wire stuff.

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:40.560
 Yeah.

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.040
 Mm-hmm.

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:44.160
 And I had my Geiger counter and I had some Plan B stuff.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:44.640
 And that was like...

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.440
 Oh, Jesus.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:45.840
 The start.

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:46.160
 Yeah.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:46.640
 Yeah.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:51.280
 That Geiger counter pedal was the thing that like hit me the most though.

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:55.280
 Like that was the module that got me into feedback patching.

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.560
 And like learning how to self patch a module.

00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:58.800
 Right.

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.400
 You know, like that opened a lot of doors to me.

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.840
 And I will also say, um, going to NomCon all those years,

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:07.520
 their booth was always a must.

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:08.400
 You stole a buy.

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:12.400
 Doesn't matter who was working, it was always super friendly,

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:16.480
 super informed, and just like genuinely excited about what they were

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.040
 working on.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:17.440
 Yeah.

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.880
 Excited to show you stuff.

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.960
 Good live sets.

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:21.440
 Yeah.

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.200
 Alex always killed it.

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.240
 Alex always crushed it.

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:24.880
 Yeah.

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:29.120
 And yeah, I always look forward to seeing him perform at the end of...

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:29.840
 We're just talking to him.

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.400
 We're just trying.

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:30.640
 Yeah.

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.640
 Like seriously accessible human.

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:33.440
 So was William.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.240
 Like, yeah.

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:34.560
 Yeah.

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.280
 Is that?

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.800
 I had a few conversations.

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.600
 Like when I had...

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.000
 When I first got that Geiger counter,

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.120
 like I had some ideas.

00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.640
 Like as I kept feedback patching in,

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:43.440
 I was like,

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.160
 I really enjoyed tweaking the tone knob.

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.200
 You know what I mean?

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.560
 And I remember emailing, I was like,

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.440
 hey, if you're ever going to do like a future revision of this,

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.640
 it would be great to be able to CV the tone knob.

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.320
 You know, and I didn't expect to hear from everything.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.320
 I just wanted to toss out a suggestion because...

00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.360
 I don't know.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:58:59.680
 You're a nerd.

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.160
 You're a nerd.

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:00.560
 I'm a nerd.

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:00.640
 I'm a nerd.

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.520
 And I was passionate about it.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:01.600
 Yeah.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.320
 And like,

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.760
 you know, it was a small community then,

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.560
 and like,

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:07.520
 didn't seem that absurd to message your manufacture.

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.600
 But yeah, it started an email chain between us,

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.480
 like just bullshitting.

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.400
 And he dropped like the science on me,

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.960
 like explaining why he can't do that.

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.720
 And like, why the tone knob is the way it is,

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.760
 and like all this stuff.

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.720
 And like, you know,

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.160
 we just started bullshitting,

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:20.720
 nerd talking.

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.920
 And I was like, you're a cool dude.

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.480
 Yeah.

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.920
 He actually responded to you,

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.400
 like a human being with respect and dignity.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:26.960
 Yeah.

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:27.760
 You explained it.

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:27.760
 Yeah.

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.400
 Like, we...

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.040
 That's fucking amazing.

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:29.040
 Yeah.

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:29.520
 We had a conversation.

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:29.840
 Yeah.

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.920
 It was pretty cool.

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:32.800
 I mean, so...

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:38.080
 I guess this is more of a question than what everyone heard.

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.920
 Is it done, done?

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.960
 Are they dead, dead?

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.000
 Are they doing something else?

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.880
 Is it morphing into something new?

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.160
 They're not clear.

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:46.560
 Okay.

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.480
 They said in their announcement that they hope

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.760
 this is a see you later,

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:50.640
 and not a goodbye.

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:51.200
 Right.

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.320
 So...

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:53.600
 That was the last thing I heard from them,

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.800
 and I was wondering if anyone heard...

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.280
 other things about what that meant.

00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:57.680
 Yeah.

00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.480
 It's pretty much like,

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.960
 you know, they can't manufacture things.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.320
 It's too expensive to like,

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.760
 just have people sitting there.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.080
 They can't execute their new ideas.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:06.640
 Right.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.320
 But you know, it's not like...

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.600
 I feel like the only reason that

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.040
 people only say it's like a year or two

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:13.920
 until that clears up,

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.560
 is just to like,

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.000
 not fuck up the stock market,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.560
 because it's like...

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.640
 It's not getting much better.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.160
 It's not like a lot of necessary

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:20.880
 and insight.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.080
 Depending on what you want.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.600
 Well, it's dependent on...

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.760
 If people want to believe

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.600
 if Joe Biden's plan to bring

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.280
 the manufacturing,

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.440
 the subject of Ohio is actually going to...

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.240
 Right.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.560
 Come to fruition by 2025.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.040
 That's the thing,

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.880
 and Chiffab takes forever.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.440
 You know?

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.520
 Chiffabs takes for so long to set up.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.160
 It also needs absolutely clean environment.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.360
 It needs a process.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:43.840
 Yeah.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.240
 It is...

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.560
 You're not going to stand that up...

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.280
 Like...

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.720
 You're not going to stand that up overnight.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.600
 You're not going to have that up

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.400
 and running in a month.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.320
 Like, even if they do meet their goal,

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.960
 that's years down the line.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.920
 Like, it's...

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.080
 I think people being optimistic

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.120
 and banking on things,

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.040
 being much better by two years from now.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.640
 I think it's probably...

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.360
 overly optimistic.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.120
 You know, things are going to be rocky,

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:07.840
 even the follow-up.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.320
 Even if it is,

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.080
 it's two years of companies

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.360
 dropping left and right.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.120
 Like, other companies are going to

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.160
 start following soon.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.000
 Another one today, actually.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.160
 Or Thogonal Devices.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.680
 I didn't see that one.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.240
 You said...

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.600
 It's pretty much...

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.120
 I'm going to take contract work,

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.640
 stopping all firmware development.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.360
 Yeah.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.280
 We'll try to make these again in 2023,

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.720
 but I can't run this company

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.560
 unless I can make 301s.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.440
 Paul Schreiber.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.160
 Yeah.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:32.960
 Paul Schreiber too.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.440
 Yeah.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.880
 He said he's going to be fulfilling orders

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.320
 until March 2023,

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.840
 which is only like, what, six months away.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.480
 Yeah.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:40.640
 Yeah.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.560
 And then he's closing up shop,

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.680
 and he said, like,

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.440
 he knows of at least six other

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.920
 big companies in the modular world

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.440
 that will probably be doing the same

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.680
 before that timeframe comes.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.840
 So kind of ominous to hear this

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.080
 from such big names in the scene.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:56.640
 Yeah.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.440
 It is, yeah.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.800
 This is where like the small people,

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.000
 I think, can probably survive,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.040
 because if you're just like,

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.080
 knocking out like 25 to 50 modules,

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.200
 it's less risk.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:05.760
 You're more like,

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.600
 "I probably have a day job already."

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.280
 When I went and picked up that module,

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.840
 that filter of crows at Pittsburgh.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.040
 They're not doing what they did.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.600
 Oh, yeah.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.200
 Three years ago, four years ago.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.960
 They're not the US dope for anymore.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.480
 Like that small run,

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.440
 limited edition stuff,

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.280
 that's their plan.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.480
 Like that's what they're doing.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.080
 Again, that's why I feel a little bit bad

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.440
 about thinking they were doing like,

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.440
 artificial scarcity.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.240
 That's not what they're doing.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:30.960
 They're going literally,

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.080
 this is what we just made.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.040
 Just actual, we can make.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:33.440
 Exactly.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:33.920
 Exactly.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.480
 Exactly.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.080
 No, that's a really good point

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.440
 and a good distinction.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.120
 And the fact that they're able to adjust

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.320
 their business to accommodate that,

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:42.960
 good for them.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:43.120
 Yeah.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.080
 As opposed to,

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.480
 they're going to probably stick around a little bit longer.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.520
 Hopefully they are able to weather this all the way through

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.200
 until we can start seeing chips again.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:51.840
 It's smart.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.000
 I remember even Russ saying this a couple years back,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.600
 because people are going to go like,

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.400
 low or tech.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.320
 They're going to find the shit they're going to build

01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.680
 and it's going to go lower cost.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.720
 And that's like what

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.800
 Pittsburgh and Create Audio seem to be doing.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.400
 It's like filling this gap of like,

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.840
 very low price stuff that still seems pretty damn good.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.760
 And I can't be mad at all.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.200
 There's some of it that I want actually.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.000
 Just because it's like,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.160
 be nice to have this like,

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.120
 everything but an oscillator voice module with a filter.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.880
 Like for however much it is,

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.480
 it's like, that's kind of fucking tempting.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.000
 The problem with that though,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.760
 is that we're going to see,

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.760
 you know, scaling back of the manufacturers,

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.360
 but demand is that an all time fucking high.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.800
 That's how inflation works.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.400
 I mean, when you have low supply,

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.760
 high demand and more people than ever building rigs right now.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.480
 Exactly.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.920
 I mean, the second hand market is like,

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.560
 blowing up.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.200
 Ooh, great.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.400
 Rice gouging.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.720
 There are a hundred people who want one of two that are on reverb.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.200
 Right.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.520
 It is still price gouging.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.600
 I'm not, and I'm not a capitalist,

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.160
 but like, I can definitely see why people are like,

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.920
 I'm going to start high.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.640
 Yeah.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.320
 Modular is going to become

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.720
 a boutique elitist hobby again.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.120
 Yes.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:03.520
 It is.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.040
 And it's also going to be a really interesting indicator of inflation.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.800
 I think you can look at that and go like,

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.920
 wow, people are,

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.960
 this isn't just people asking for outrageous shit.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.160
 People are actually selling for this outrageous braces.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.120
 The problem with that though,

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.400
 is that that is good for collectors.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.440
 It's terrible for people that actually use this shit.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:23.920
 Oh, yeah.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.480
 Yeah.

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.440
 Oh, totally.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.160
 Yeah.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.640
 And I think it brings it back to the hybrid systems too,

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:28.960
 in a way.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.840
 It's going to be like,

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.800
 Exactly.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.960
 What can you make use of in the computer?

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.880
 Maybe you don't get like a virtual module.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.080
 You can't get a chip off now,

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.680
 but you do get an analog filter.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.080
 Yes.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.600
 That's like 150 bucks.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.800
 That's pretty like good.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.640
 I just, in my head,

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.720
 I see this going the way as like,

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.600
 the shoe market.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.240
 You know, because like, my cousin,

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.160
 we've discussed this in the past,

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.080
 he's all about sneakers.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.720
 And sneakers over time,

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.280
 you see a fuck ton of that,

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.120
 you know, manufactured,

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.520
 hype and...

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.200
 It has its own market.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.280
 It really is an individual market.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:05.600
 Right.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.920
 And they have raffles,

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.080
 just to be able to pre-order something.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:16.240
 To give people a chance to buy it,

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.600
 and then flip it.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.800
 And all of that buying and flipping is an buy.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.840
 And you can buy spots

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.640
 to try and get these things.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.040
 And like,

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:27.840
 Ah, man.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.880
 That's what I think it goes best,

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.520
 when you get people that buy just to immediately flip,

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.320
 which I think is like,

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.280
 I can never see.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.160
 Like, you go out and you work and you create value.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:42.560
 Going out and banking on capital and creating capital

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.760
 has...

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.000
 And this is a perfect example of it,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
 that it no value whatsoever,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.360
 but it's created capital.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:49.920
 It's a game.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.040
 Yeah, I mean, it's a whole game.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.720
 The whole flipping shoe market,

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.920
 it's like a whole game.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.400
 And we're going to see the same fucking thing in module.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:56.720
 Yeah.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.200
 That's what I'm saying,

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.720
 it's going to benefit collectors.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.120
 Absolutely.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.960
 I have this module that no one else has,

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.480
 and it's worth a thousand dollars.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.480
 Well, retail, it's only a hundred.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:04.800
 Right.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.680
 But because you paid the inflated fucking price

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.840
 of some price gouger on Reverb,

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.320
 you can now say that this is worth a thousand dollars.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.600
 And that's the other problem is,

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.720
 you now then have,

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.800
 well, let me go look at the sold listings.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.120
 Yeah.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.800
 Well, shit, now this is going for 800,

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.080
 this is going for a thousand.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.520
 It's very hard to go the other way from that.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.640
 It's very hard for that to slide back down.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.040
 Right.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.560
 It's easy for that to ratchet up.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:28.880
 Oh, yeah.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.240
 And once the market snowball's...

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:30.720
 Exactly.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.160
 ...and getting that ball back up the hill.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:32.880
 Yeah.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.600
 Yeah.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:33.760
 Yeah.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.240
 I sold my plinky synth for like 300 bucks.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.640
 Now they go for like almost $2,000 sometimes.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.680
 Yeah, that's crazy.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.360
 Which blows my fucking mind.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.040
 The pink faceplate,

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.800
 Lokelika Teratas that you just got,

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.120
 is already on Reverb

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.680
 from other people that grabbed them up from that badge.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.000
 Yeah.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.920
 They're flipping them for 400 plus dollars.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.920
 Yeah, just to make an extra quick hundred bucks.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.720
 And that's like...

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.120
 Ugh.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.600
 The whole point of that limited run

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.400
 from noise engineering was to generate money to charity.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:01.680
 If you...

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.160
 Unless you were giving your dividend between what you paid.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:04.720
 They're not.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.040
 Yeah.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.800
 And what you marked that up for,

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.680
 to that charity.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.200
 They're abusing what the monster.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:09.600
 Right.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.240
 Fuck you.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.120
 Exactly.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.400
 You are missing the point.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.800
 They're abusing what started out as like a good cause.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.560
 Like they were limited for a reason,

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.320
 because they were meant to generate money for a charity.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.240
 You know, people snagged them up,

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.760
 which I guess on one hand is good.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:22.720
 They did get the money.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.120
 Right.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:23.280
 Right.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.080
 To put to that charity.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.080
 But now these guys are trying to profit.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.520
 It hasn't even been out for a week.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.400
 No, not even.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.040
 But that's a shitty rationale that looked like really...

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.320
 But this is what we're going to see.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.280
 Like why spread now?

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:33.840
 Absolutely.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.240
 Yeah.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.400
 I've made a little profit off a module too.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.760
 I can't say that I haven't,

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:41.920
 but I've never like taken it to the extreme that some people have.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.960
 Like I've paid like...

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.080
 Ideally I just want to like,

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.480
 if I can pay nothing to have rented a module,

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.000
 then I'm totally happy.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:48.320
 Yeah.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:48.880
 You know.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.320
 And like maybe once or twice,

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:50.880
 I've been like,

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.440
 "Oh, this thing's actually like going for like 600,

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.240
 all like seven for five or something like that."

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.840
 Go always try to be the lowest person

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.440
 and have a reasonable price.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.720
 I always go with the lowest

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.000
 because I don't want like,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.680
 once I've decided to sell something,

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.280
 I wanted to fuck out of my house.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.480
 I always try to be the lowest person.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.520
 Yeah, I want to get rid of it.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.080
 Done with it.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:08.560
 Yeah.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.440
 And honestly, it's worked a lot in reverb,

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.960
 especially with this last batch

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.800
 and a box of shit that I need to get rid of.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.880
 It's flying out of my fucking house

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.760
 because I'm like,

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.840
 "What's the lowest one right now?

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.720
 Five dollars less."

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.440
 Yeah.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:21.840
 Cool.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:22.400
 That's enough.

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:22.720
 Yeah.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:26.320
 I'm stoked because I don't want it anymore.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.080
 And honestly, in most cases,

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.920
 still more than when I paid for it.

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.240
 Right.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.720
 A lot of stuff is going for more than what I paid for it.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.880
 That's the real coupon code trick

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.040
 is to buy everything with a coupon code.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.480
 Then you can resell it basically using that coupon code value

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:43.040
 and you pay like $20 to rent a module a lot of the time

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.160
 or you eat like shipping.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.520
 Yeah, I think we're going to see a lot of people

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:50.800
 getting into modular sales

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.960
 that have nothing to do with the community.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.960
 Like you were talking about my cousin who,

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.560
 I mean, he is part of the shoe community.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.120
 I'll give him that.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:08:59.200
 Yeah.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.040
 Like he collects them,

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.160
 he wears them,

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:06.400
 he's not just playing the reselling game,

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.240
 but he does to an extent separate

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:12.000
 like his fandom stuff and the market stuff

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.280
 that he gets just to flip.

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:13.840
 Yeah.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.280
 Basically, he tries to

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:20.320
 pay for his shoe addiction by flipping other shoes

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.680
 that he has no interest in wearing.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:24.160
 You know, so it's like kind of offsets each other.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.080
 But yeah, I don't know.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.320
 I think with modular, we're just going to be seeing people

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.400
 just being leeches and...

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.120
 Oh, absolutely.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.280
 Oh, there's 100 modules coming out of this.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:36.320
 I'm going to buy all 100 of them and control the market

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.400
 and list them one at a time on reverb for an inflated price.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.520
 And who's going to stop them?

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.000
 Exactly.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:42.880
 The problem is...

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.840
 It's too easy.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.960
 We have nothing...

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.320
 We have no infrastructure in place

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.280
 in the modular community to protect against this

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.400
 or prepare for it.

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.040
 And I think a lot of people are not prepared for it.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:55.440
 Oh, absolutely.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.280
 They're just using shopping cart software

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.560
 or they're using a service.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.960
 They're using basically nothing to set up.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:01.600
 I mean, even...

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.280
 People are going to start writing bots.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:03.840
 Exactly.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.840
 And like, you look at like shoes.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.760
 There is almost like that.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.720
 You know, as one side advances,

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.320
 the other side has to go a little bit further.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:18.240
 I feel like shoe buying and shoe shopping carts.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.600
 I mean, even like what Cyrus was explaining to me,

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.600
 like they are getting more sophisticated.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:23.840
 Oh, yeah.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.840
 So they've evolved to their own.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.840
 As the people that are buying them

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.200
 have gotten more sophisticated.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.080
 Maybe I'm wrong,

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.000
 but I think you're right.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.240
 That all of these module sellers

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.760
 have not had to deal with this.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.320
 Correct.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.480
 So if someone really did want to just go and buy

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.200
 all of those pink,

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.720
 lukellic modules.

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.800
 Buy them all within a nanosecond.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.200
 Like you said, control that market.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.880
 Salt for what they want to.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.080
 In the shoe scene,

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.400
 you see resellers that have protections in place

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.840
 that can track what address these credit cards

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.720
 tying back to.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.160
 You know what I mean?

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:00.880
 Things like that.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.200
 So that you can hard limit people.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:03.760
 Yeah.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.160
 Yeah.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.400
 So that they can't fully control the market.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.200
 That's what he was explaining is that like the days of just like,

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.120
 I now own every one of these shoes is over.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.360
 And then because they've had to then

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.560
 as the as these spot buyer seller flippers

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.120
 have evolved, they've also evolved.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:23.920
 Yeah.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.960
 In the modular scene?

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:25.360
 No.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.320
 People are running little homebrew shops

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.840
 and online carts that can be taking advantage of easily.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:32.800
 Squarespace shit.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:33.920
 Squarespace shit.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.560
 Exactly.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.120
 Etsy.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.080
 Yeah.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:36.880
 Even Etsy.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.120
 Yeah.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.560
 They're just not ready.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.440
 And it's going to, you're right.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.840
 It takes one person to talk this on.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.640
 There's going to be some

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.960
 big wallet whales that are going to step in

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.080
 and control the market

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.360
 and make things impossible

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.680
 for the normal consumer to buy at anywhere near retail value.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.360
 And we were talking five years ago about,

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.840
 you know, there's so many manufacturers out there.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.040
 They're all doing the same thing.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.960
 There's so much sort of saturation of utility modules.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.480
 And we're a year away from

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:07.680
 people paying $800 for an ADSR.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.080
 Yeah.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.520
 It's going to get split.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:12.160
 We're going to have two different modular communities basically.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:15.840
 There's going to be the collector inflated name brand market.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.680
 And then there's going to be the little dudes

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.640
 that manage to get some components and do small brew.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.120
 Yeah.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.600
 Batches of things that people can afford

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.200
 and post them up on Etsy and things like that.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:25.920
 Like you were saying,

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.800
 there's going to be the dudes that do the small stuff.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.360
 And...

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.160
 Or like Russell was saying,

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:30.880
 when he was like,

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.920
 what can I do with this chip that is regularly available?

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.480
 What does that mean?

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.120
 Whatever these small brews,

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.680
 these microbreweries of modules

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.000
 can obtain whatever components they get.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.720
 And they release small batches that are too fancy

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.720
 or that appealing to collectors.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:47.440
 Right.

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.760
 It's going to be two separate fucking markets.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.720
 I think you're absolutely right.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.840
 And it's like...

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.680
 My noise engineering was kind of smart too,

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.080
 it's because they invested in that daisy platforms.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.440
 Now they can just spin off all different types of modules,

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.040
 but it's just the same hardware,

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.480
 as long as they can keep getting that shit.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.040
 Yes.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.160
 And they're pretty much good,

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.480
 you know, which is fucking brilliant in a way.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.320
 Not Arduino in particular,

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.320
 but some of the out of fruit stuff,

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.200
 some of the...

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.720
 Basically, some of these sort of smaller dedicated embedded systems

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.080
 we've seen it here and there pop up,

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.320
 Oregon accumulator using the TNC.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.880
 Is there a potential for,

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.840
 "Hey, listen, we're still found a way to make

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.000
 these little tiny embedded systems,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
 these little microprocessors."

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.480
 I can get 200 of these,

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:40.160
 I can actually make a run of a module using these.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.000
 Do you think maybe there's going to be a shift towards

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.680
 using some of those four things like sequencers

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.480
 or things that lend themselves to digital processing?

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.920
 I think it could be for some of the stuff

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.320
 that isn't outright shittier latencies

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.800
 and really crippled and not easy to make useful stuff for.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.800
 It's been DSP,

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.640
 everybody's been using that thing forever

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.000
 to make different types of effects,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.640
 including happy nerding and tip-top.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.160
 But yeah, I don't know,

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.360
 it'll be interesting to see if somebody...

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.640
 Was it STM-32s, those chips?

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.400
 Those are the ones behind the MIDI box,

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.440
 and they're a step back from some of the ARM processors in ways.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.800
 Apparently, maybe even car companies are trying to buy those

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.240
 so they can make automation in cars with the shittier processor.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:26.720
 So probably to some extent to the extent that the big, big players

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.160
 like car companies will allow that shit to be bought.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.520
 Right, at some point,

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.800
 there's external forces that are going to make that impossible to do,

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.760
 but I wonder if there's just that thing of like...

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.840
 I wasn't interested in that because...

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.840
 Well, all these other options were available

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.720
 because chips were...

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:47.920
 They flowed like the Mighty Mississippi River.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.160
 Like, that wasn't a problem,

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.600
 but now that it is, it's like, "Oh shit, you're actually making that,

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.840
 and it's available, and it's readily available.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.040
 What can I do with it?"

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.080
 Yeah, like, you can't get...

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.240
 It's hard to get Raspberry Pi 4 still,

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.680
 and I have one because I do like,

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:05.200
 Bitcoin shit with it, and like some self-hosting stuff,

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.320
 but you can get now these like,

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.400
 mini Raspberry Pi's that are like super small.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.840
 I was looking at today that are still like,

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.320
 apparently like, good enough latencies maybe.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.320
 So like, I hope things like that that are interesting,

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.680
 that are like, single purpose,

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.280
 or like, cool come up that are like,

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.120
 "Ah, you can still do like,

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.360
 one millisecond in and out, audio, IO,

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.160
 but it's just not as like, robust as this other fucking thing."

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.400
 So, I guess another way to phrase this is,

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.160
 are we on the cusp of people being creative,

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.640
 not so much about what the module does,

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.200
 but what resources are available to them

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.880
 to actually manufacture something?

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.680
 That'd be cool.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.200
 I think it's be interesting.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:37.760
 I think so, yeah.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.680
 Might force some creative designs again.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.720
 Yes, yeah.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.640
 I think a lot of things have been lacking in that department.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.280
 Absolutely.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.640
 Over the last year or so.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.080
 Kind of plateaued anyway.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.120
 Yes, exactly.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:49.600
 You know.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.640
 And we were talking about this like,

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.520
 a couple of years ago.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.360
 Yeah, I think it's just cycled again.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.040
 When things were plateauing, yeah.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.440
 I mean, we just looked at the atmosphere,

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.720
 like, just how like,

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.240
 knob con changed over time.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:00.800
 Yeah.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:01.760
 Taking a look around like,

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.760
 "Okay, things are changing.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.360
 Things are plateauing.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.720
 The market is shifting."

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:07.360
 Yeah.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:12.240
 And I think with this announcement of WMD closing up shop,

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:17.040
 like, I think that is the beginning of the end, so to speak.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.640
 That is going to have huge impacts.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.000
 Clearly more manufacturers are going to follow suit

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.920
 or have to adapt.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.480
 And the market is clearly going to feel the impact of all of this.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.600
 Absolutely.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.440
 I guess the other thing I'm a little worried about is,

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.440
 I've just assumed that like,

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.720
 you know, I've got a bunch of modules

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.400
 from a bunch of different manufacturers.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.320
 All of them are, you know,

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.680
 one to maybe three people shops, right?

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.360
 I've always assumed like,

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.120
 "Oh, if I have a problem with this,

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.760
 there's someone I can talk to about fixing it."

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.120
 How far away is it where,

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.680
 "Oh, shit, this isn't documented.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.120
 There's no manual for this.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.800
 This isn't like a corg.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.720
 I can't go, you know,

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:01.520
 we're friends with Chase,

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.800
 who does synth repair in Brooklyn."

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.120
 Again, if you are in Brooklyn,

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.600
 you need your synthesizer repaired.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:10.880
 Chase at what's it called?

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:14.400
 Specs, I think they're closing the shop because Willie's moving,

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.400
 but Chase Smith still will do repairs and such for sure.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.000
 But will he be able to take my weird esoteric module

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.240
 that was made by someone two years ago and fix that?

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.000
 He already gets, Chase already gets like boxes of modules

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.360
 handed to him sometimes.

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.160
 He picks all these and he's like, "But how?"

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.040
 Right, you know.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.320
 It's not this document.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.040
 This is weird.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.000
 And I think that's the other thing I've been worried about is like,

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.800
 "Am I looking at like,

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:49.760
 'Oh, this is actually the start of the end of this module working?'

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.840
 Because the company that made this

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.280
 might be going on a business in a year.

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.440
 And then two years from now,

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.240
 it doesn't work.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:02.000
 And I hope maybe someone on mod Wilgler talked about it.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.680
 I already felt the impact of that whenever I had a bunch of Plan B modules.

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.880
 And they went under.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:10.080
 And they were non-functional quickly.

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.400
 Like that's why they went under because quality control.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.320
 But yeah, like there was major conversations going on,

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.160
 like on mod Wilgler at the time and things like that.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.200
 I wasn't the only one that had faulty Plan B modules

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.320
 and like trying to help each other out.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.040
 And come up with like schematics and talk about shit.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.240
 And there was a few other manufacturers that were offering help and things like that.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.240
 So yeah, I think to your point,

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.560
 I don't think we're far off from that at all.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.240
 Like even WMD said like,

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.960
 "We'll cross that bridge when we get there,

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.960
 when it comes to like long time support."

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.000
 But like clearly, like if there's shops closed,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.120
 there's shops closed.

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:50.160
 They're not sticking around to just help people,

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.680
 you know, for the next couple of years with whatever random issues they come across

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:54.800
 with a module or a pedal.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.640
 Like you're going to be screwed.

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.640
 It's basically the bottom line.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.960
 And yeah, the more manufacturers in the module

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:08.720
 are seeing that close up shop and the more rare components get,

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.160
 I think support is going to be non-existent pretty much.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:12.640
 Right.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.520
 I think it could open up some avenues for like maybe general repair businesses.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.240
 Like a Euro-ac repair person that comes up that just tries to like-

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.680
 You break-eye-fix shops from us.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.520
 Yeah, I can totally see it, especially like within countries

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:30.160
 and people that like their job is just to build up knowledge on how to fix different types of

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.040
 modules, collect, wipe-pay, like all the manuals and shit.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:37.520
 Honestly, I think like that is a license to print money in five years.

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.160
 Yep.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:40.160
 I honestly think like, especially because like-

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.920
 OLEDs failing.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.320
 Sorry.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.120
 Yeah, no, but like, like at some point,

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.520
 like right now if a module that I have fails, I just get rid of it.

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.880
 At some point, I'm probably not going to-

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.800
 Like that- the market is not going to encourage me to just get rid of things

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:55.840
 and get another one.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:58.240
 Because you get another one, won't be an option.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.040
 Sure.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:05.600
 My motivation to repair this thing that I have will be really high.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:10.080
 And if there is a person out there that- even if it's one person and it takes them two months

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.600
 because they're backed up with orders and requests for repair,

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.680
 I will send them this module to get this fixed.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.160
 Yeah.

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:23.440
 So again, anyone out there who wants to start accumulating this knowledge database and like

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:27.760
 basically prepare for a future in electronic repair,

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.360
 honestly, I think it's a great business opportunity.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.040
 Because I think like repairing modules is going to be a thing that's-

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.360
 we haven't really seen in the past.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:37.680
 Yeah.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.840
 Because I can see like companies doing too like Scott.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.680
 Scott could probably- from industrial musical electronics could probably just repair

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:48.960
 shit for a while with the amount of modules that he's pumped out and the issues that might

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.160
 come up and how proprietary his stuff is, especially in digital.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:52.480
 Yeah.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:52.960
 Yeah.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.160
 Like it seems like reasonable business, but yeah, like general repair,

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.560
 electronics for replace OLEDs.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:58.880
 Yeah.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.720
 Fixed surface mount shit that's really hard to like do stuff, help troubleshooting.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:03.040
 Right.

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.960
 I don't even think most things that get sent in for repair get repaired these days.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:11.840
 Like most people don't talk to the manufacturer, they talk to whatever shop they-

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:12.320
 Order chrome.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.120
 That's a good point.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.400
 And they send it to the shop and the shop just gives them a new one

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:19.680
 because it's not worth the time of the manufacturer trying to fix this shit.

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:24.160
 They just replace it, but like if things are getting scarce,

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.920
 not even able to swap it out anymore.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.280
 No, no, maybe that's what we should be doing.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.320
 Yeah.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.640
 We're going to take all of that Patreon money.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:35.440
 So our collecting these documents with the idea that we're going to be

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:40.240
 the post-apocalyptic Mad Max, your rec repair.

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.360
 Modular dystopia.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:41.760
 Yes.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.560
 We're going to be living in starting 2020.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.200
 Which we kind of just painted for the last 10 minutes now.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:47.760
 Yeah.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:48.480
 Yeah.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:52.640
 But yeah, not trying to be all doom and gloom, but like one again,

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.440
 one a giant like WMD is closing up shop.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.520
 Like you got to read the writing on the wall here.

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:57.920
 Absolutely.

01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:58.560
 Like it's-

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:02.560
 I don't think it's hit most people right now.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:02.560
 Yeah.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.120
 So far.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.360
 Like what that means, you know, like all around.

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.400
 Because there's still new stuff coming out, you can still buy it eventually.

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.400
 It's still like things are still humming along.

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.200
 Yeah.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:11.840
 To a degree.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.960
 Modular dystopia.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:13.200
 That's-

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.400
 I think that's the phase we're entering at this point.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.400
 Is that the subtitle for this episode?

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.040
 Absolutely.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:37.040
 We haven't had a

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:43.440
 replacement.

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:43.440
 Yeah.

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:43.440
 Yeah.

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.720
 You know, like if there's something out there, no time like the present.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.200
 Yeah.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.880
 I kind of like went a little overboard recently and like rained it in, but I like-

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:51.760
 I am right now.

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:52.480
 I am right now.

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.280
 I might be going home and like taking things off a reverb.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.320
 Like it's literally that thing.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.120
 I was going to say that.

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.320
 I did a couple of things like that.

01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:58.480
 Yeah.

01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.200
 Like I'm like-

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:02.240
 When we were discussing a few minutes ago about like selling at the cheapest,

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:05.680
 I was going to say now might not be the time to do that.

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.000
 Yeah.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:06.320
 Yeah.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:11.360
 It might be the move right now to like anything that you don't want.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.320
 You don't really need to cash them and it maybe sit on it for a little bit.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:14.800
 Yeah.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.640
 Because things are about to shift.

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:17.120
 You know.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.320
 I mean, one of the things that I had that hasn't sold yet is a ZDSB.

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.640
 I mean, you really want that in a couple years.

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:23.760
 Like that might be-

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.280
 That might not be able to get one again.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:25.760
 Right.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.080
 Right.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:26.400
 Yeah.

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.080
 Like I'm extremely guilty of that.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.680
 Like some of the stuff that I've been restructuring with my modular right now

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.760
 is stuff that I've already owned and sold.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.280
 Like the muscle compressor,

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.320
 you know, things like that.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:36.960
 Yeah.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.000
 Um, because I do that because it's available.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:40.320
 Right.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:43.600
 And I usually am able to sell it without much of a loss.

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:46.480
 Because I do try to buy things on sale or second aid.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:46.880
 You know what I mean?

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:46.880
 Right.

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.080
 So it's like to me, it's just like, okay, I don't need this right now.

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:50.720
 Sell it.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.280
 Yeah.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.360
 If I need it again in the future, I'll buy it back.

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.560
 And that's what I'm currently doing.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.920
 And like now I'm like,

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:00.400
 "Eesh, that's no longer going to be the way I can operate."

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:00.960
 Yeah.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:04.160
 I need to figure out my rig, get what I can.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:07.280
 If it's available before it gets too expensive, you know, like...

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:10.000
 Like I got this Keep It.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.520
 Fraptools group module.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:14.880
 There's a Mark 1 of Mark 2 and I just finally found the Mark 2 somewhere.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:15.760
 So I bought it.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:16.400
 Yeah.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:20.880
 Sold it or trying to sell it to like be 50 bucks to get this stupid switch that lets you.

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:21.600
 It's not stupid.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.880
 It lets you just send the wet signal out or the mix of everything.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:27.120
 So you can do like multi-tracking really easily.

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.000
 But I was selling it.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.560
 It's like only 170 bucks shipped or something like that.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.760
 It's not very expensive.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.520
 But I was like, what if the other one breaks?

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.360
 Like should I just keep the other one because it works fine.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.480
 It's just got a jumper on the back instead of a switch on the front and the knob is like better size.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.320
 And like if that fucks it up, I can't like, I don't know what's wrong with it.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:46.800
 And you can...

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.800
 I know we talk a lot about DIY and maybe romanticize it in a way that's...

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.920
 We're all keen on DIY.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.280
 I love doing it in our size.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:00.560
 And like, but like what if that ends up being the sort of like way that a lot of stuff is made?

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:06.240
 And the new sort of transaction is like, you know, I cobbled together the pieces to this thing.

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:06.880
 Yeah.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.320
 Here's a kit.

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.600
 Try to get your components.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.560
 Exactly.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.080
 And like here's the PCB.

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.680
 Here's a couple of the SMDs that's on the board already, etc, etc.

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:16.960
 But like it is...

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.640
 I think you're right on the money.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:24.480
 I mean, we've seen the DIY world grow a lot already.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.560
 Not I guess because they're preparing for this, but just because like in general prices

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.000
 have already shaped and things like that.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.040
 And it's like, yeah, some people can only afford a modular by going to the DIY route.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:35.520
 Yeah.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.080
 You know what I mean?

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:41.200
 And that's also the purest, hobbyist approach to take to it.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.320
 You know what I mean?

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:42.960
 But...

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.600
 You can get like that macro pod kit was like 150 bucks for like one of the coolest filters I have.

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.640
 And most of it, like the surface mount, it was done.

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:55.120
 So it was like hardware, knobs, like a few components.

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.160
 And it was so easy.

01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:00.560
 Like it's becoming more and more of a realistic option as people do these things where it's like,

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.440
 it's a lot cheaper for me not to do the hardware and manually.

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.320
 Like you do that.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.960
 I'll do the hard part in the electronics.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.920
 It's like sweet.

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:08.480
 It's probably...

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.960
 Yeah, like your science is probably going to be the only way that some manufacturers can exist.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:13.280
 Right.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:13.440
 Yeah.

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.400
 I kind of love it too.

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.880
 It kind of just shifts the focus and makes it seem a little...

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.080
 I hate to see the word, but a little more precious and aware.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.800
 At least something you don't take for granted as much.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:22.880
 Sure.

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.960
 Take for granted I think is probably the good way to put it.

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:25.760
 It's like...

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.280
 I think I have.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:27.680
 I have.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.960
 Oh, I have too.

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:32.160
 This is not like a projected doomsday.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.200
 This is...

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:33.760
 Oh, shit.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.600
 We're actually starting to see those ripples.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:35.920
 Yeah.

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.720
 I think we were projecting back in January based on what we're seeing.

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:41.360
 It's no longer a projection at this point.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:50.320
 It's where things are in motion that are going to forever impact this whole scene.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.120
 For lack of a better way.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.080
 Yavin the knob con manufacturers list.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.840
 They've seen as much smaller.

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.320
 Right.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.040
 It's because WMD did say they will be there this year.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.040
 They said they'll be there, have a beer with them.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:07.360
 They're going to hype up their latest and, I guess, last new modules.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.520
 So I didn't want to go to knob con because it's in Chicago.

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.120
 It's not an insignificant trip.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.840
 The idea of going and just having one last drink with them.

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.600
 That's some beautiful teardown, my cheek type of thing.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.600
 I have a feeling it won't be just one last drink with them.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:27.120
 I feel like this might be the last hurrah in a few ways.

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:29.200
 That's what I was thinking too.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:31.680
 Like it might be the last one of them.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:34.320
 I'm kind of leaning towards going and just being like,

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.960
 let's all get drunk and cry about the future.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:37.960
 *laughs*

01:27:37.960 --> 01:28:01.960
 *outro music*
