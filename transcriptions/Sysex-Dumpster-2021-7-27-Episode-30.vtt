WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:26.600
 - Yeah, we're here.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.600
 - Where are we, Greg?

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.420
 - We're in the Chateaule, Greg.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.260
 In my mid-century basement bar

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.960
 with special guest Baboy the Cat,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.140
 jumping on everything.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.980
 - Bounding.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.860
 - 'Cause he's decided, since I've moved in here,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.700
 that this whole downstairs, this is a domain.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.740
 He gets excited anytime anyone's down here.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.140
 - I think you got it twisted.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.980
 This entire fucking house is a domain.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.900
 Like you just live here.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.460
 - You doesn't give a fuck about the upstairs.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.020
 - He gets so excited if I stand up

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.740
 and I start moving towards the basement steps.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.820
 He just like runs down here,

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.420
 gets all fucking hyped up.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.180
 Ever since I put that couch there,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.780
 that couch he went apshit for immediately,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.900
 like jumped on it and never got off of it.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.500
 Like he just decided like, that's his.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.820
 Like I just finished vacuuming all the cat for off of it

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.660
 before you guys got here,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.340
 'cause it was just covered in it.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.660
 He's just been squatting on my couch.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.700
 - 'Cause he knows this is where the party's going to be.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.820
 - Yeah. - Absolutely.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.660
 Should we describe what we're seeing?

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.500
 - No.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.420
 - No.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.620
 - People aren't allowed to know.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.860
 - I don't think they could handle it.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.340
 - You posted it on the internet already.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.820
 (laughs)

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.860
 Only part of it.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.700
 All right, that's right.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.540
 - Yeah.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.180
 The rest must be left to speculation.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.220
 Now that people can have physical parties

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.380
 in the meat space,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.780
 there's gonna be some orgies in here for sure.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.120
 Some Illuminati secret parties.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.260
 Maybe some tabletop gaming, but.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.660
 - Right, right.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.860
 - If we can squeeze it in,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.140
 you know, it's gonna be pretty busy down here.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.220
 (laughs)

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.140
 'Tis the season.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.220
 - Yeah, you know, it was famous.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.140
 Hallmark cards 'Tis the season

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.180
 for secret Illuminati sex orgies.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.020
 - Yeah.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.180
 - That's what that's about, right?

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.020
 - I don't know.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.100
 - I don't really understand Christianity.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.500
 - Yeah.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.820
 There's that guy dying day too or whatever.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.780
 Born, sorry, born the other one.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.900
 It's Easter.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.820
 - What does he come back to?

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.820
 - Fuck, I don't know.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.660
 I'm not good at this.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.500
 I was a Catholic.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.100
 I've rejected all of this.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.820
 - So your Catholicism is on par with like

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.220
 all of the French that I learned in middle school.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.540
 You just forget all of it.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.380
 - Yeah.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.460
 - So Greg, what are you drinking in your,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.620
 in this very lovely fancy red zinger?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.500
 - Never had red zinger.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.500
 Is that herbal?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.620
 - Yeah.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.580
 - It's delicious.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.580
 - Is it raspberry?

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.420
 Like, I forget it.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.460
 - No, it's mostly like cherry-ish.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.700
 - What does zinger come from?

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.580
 What does zinger mean?

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.660
 Is it taste?

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.460
 - It's like a celestial season red zinger.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.940
 I used to get a high of all the time.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.780
 - Yeah.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.620
 - There's like a lemon zinger.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.740
 - Yeah, there's a lemon zinger, orange zinger.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.140
 I used to be my go-to at the beehive,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.660
 and I'd get a big old pot red zinger.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.740
 - Some honey.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.580
 - All right then.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.500
 Does it taste like a Dr. Rapper?

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.340
 - No.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.180
 - Just a little coke in it.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.020
 - Not at all.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.860
 - All right.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.620
 - Honestly, I've never had a zinger.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.660
 - Like, almost like a fruit punchy,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.380
 it's like a flavor, yeah, it's zingy here.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.940
 (both laughing)

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.980
 - Got the zing on full effect.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.580
 - I don't know what zing tastes like.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.260
 That's the problem I'm having here.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.660
 - Maybe you'll find out one to use your imagination.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.500
 - I did, but all I keep coming back to is Dr. Rapper.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.860
 - There's a little bit of zing to Dr. Rapper.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.700
 - There is.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.540
 - That is true.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.700
 - A little bit of a, you know, a little zip.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.220
 - I'm not wrong here.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.180
 - Cheer wine.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.020
 - I've had cheer wine.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.500
 - It's got that same Dr. Mm-Rish as it to it.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.340
 - Okay, okay.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.180
 - It does.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.020
 - But it tastes absolutely nothing like this tea.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.860
 - No.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.700
 - Just so you know.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.780
 - I'm so confused.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.220
 I know less about this tea than when we started.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.060
 - What about you?

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.060
 - Oh, so I'm drinking a jax.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.500
 It's a, I believe it's from Pennsylvania.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.420
 - Helens blend, it says.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.420
 - It's Helens blend and it is not fresh.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.420
 - It's been aged right here.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.300
 - It's been aged unintentionally aged.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.700
 So the, every Tuesday night, I played it under the dragons.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.340
 Going on for like 15 years, I think, no.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.820
 Maybe longer, I don't know.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.140
 We're teeny, you know, someone be like,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.940
 oh, we're getting low on beer.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.100
 Buy a bunch of beer, bunch of cider.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.460
 Have it sort of stockpiled, you know.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.220
 And refresh the pile every once in a while.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.220
 This stock is from right before a pandemic.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.740
 We bought a bunch, it was sitting there.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.780
 And then--

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.940
 - Second to be like a new thing.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.300
 Special vintage pre-pandemic.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.140
 - Yes.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.580
 (laughing)

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.340
 - It tastes fine and it doesn't seem to be dangerous.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.060
 There's probably other stuff that is less friendly

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.740
 to the post pandemic.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.260
 - It's like pre-war, post-war.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.820
 No, we got a pre-pandemic post-war.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.780
 - Gotta get that pre, it's so much more valuable.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.860
 - Yeah.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.380
 Rare, rare bird.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.980
 - Everything after it was shit.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.700
 (laughing)

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.940
 - So that's what I'm drinking now.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.980
 - And what do you got there, Nick?

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.860
 - I'm triple-fist in it today.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.060
 So I'm drinking one of these ciders

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.820
 that's gonna make us sick.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.660
 Drinking a toasted white chocolate Starbucks drink

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.300
 that's definitely gonna make me fucking sick.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.500
 And then this elderberry kombucha

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.740
 that's gonna make me not sick.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.580
 So hopefully it balances all out.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.340
 - Just all cancels each other out.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.420
 - Yeah, I can't but better.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.700
 Needed some caffeine.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.900
 I had this, I actually like drove,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.500
 I was pulling out of the driveway,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.380
 stopped my car, pulled back in, got this drink

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.020
 and something else, this hat that I forgot.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.780
 'Cause I was like, oh, it's kinda cold.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.020
 And thank God I got the drink, right?

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.780
 - You know what though, this may be saving you

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.460
 because between the potentially dangerous jacks

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.620
 and that Starbucks drink that you described,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.620
 that sounds like hell,

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.060
 the kombucha might be the only thing

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.300
 that saves your stomach later.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.860
 - Or I'll just be projectile vomiting in the 15 minutes.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.620
 (laughing)

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.940
 - All over this new basement.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.060
 - Damn it.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.740
 - New to Greg basement.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.260
 - Yeah, I guess I could expand a little bit on the fact

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.020
 that this is- - You're being really

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.540
 secretive about this basement.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.660
 - I'm secretive Dave, I'm mysterious.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.580
 - Just let 'em in a little bit,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.660
 just a little bit, a little tidbit.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.700
 - Little tease, yeah.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.060
 - I mean, I already said it's a mid-century bar,

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.820
 but yeah, how to describe it I guess?

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.860
 I don't know, surrounded by almond wood paneling

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.740
 and yeah, from Mika.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.420
 (laughing)

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.220
 - No, what is this?

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.420
 This?

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.340
 - Why do you solve this?

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.420
 - This would not be for Mika.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.260
 - No.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.100
 - No, it's a,

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.860
 I don't know.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.620
 - It's a nice checker bar top.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.300
 Weird red acrylic I imagine paneling.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.820
 - Yeah, there's red glass and red acrylic everywhere.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.660
 - Yeah.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.740
 - No, Doug, it's fabulous.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.820
 It really does look amazing.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.180
 - Yeah, it's my new spot.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.140
 Been living here for about a month now.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.420
 - A lot has happened since the last episode.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.260
 - Yeah.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.100
 - Yeah.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.180
 - Including me moving into a house.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.980
 Congratulations.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.820
 - Thank you.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.660
 - Yeah, dude.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.500
 Good to be here.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.620
 And this is episode 30

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.540
 and we're gathered face to face

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.500
 for the second time in a year and a half.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.340
 - Wow.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.900
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.060
 And yeah, like what, 16, 17 months?

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.900
 Something like that.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.220
 - I feel like this one's gonna stick though.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.380
 'Cause the last one we just did it

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.740
 because it was like we had dipped into like yellow zone

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.900
 or like whatever, like it wasn't super dangerous.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.740
 So we gave it a shot.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.660
 And like now we're all vaccinated.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.780
 Now we're invincible.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.620
 - Yeah.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.900
 - Now we can do anything.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.100
 Our super mutant abilities have yet the surface

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.860
 from our 5G shots, but I'm waiting.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.700
 - Yeah.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.540
 - I'm excited.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.660
 See what the big reveal is.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.660
 - What do you think you're getting?

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.580
 - I'm saying I'm getting Wolverine claws, dude.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.940
 Absolutely.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.780
 - I've just been buying lots

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.580
 of Microsoft products lately.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.460
 (both laughing)

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.580
 That's a sick ability, bro.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:20.060
 - So, did anybody have any notes,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.660
 any things they wanna talk about?

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.620
 - Someone has some notes.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.660
 - You said, "Goddamn, yeah, that's a lot of notes."

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.780
 - He's got lots of text.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.780
 - A wall of text I'm looking at.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.820
 - 'Cause I'm better, I've always been better

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.220
 just typing my thoughts rather than speaking them.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.220
 So sometimes if I have a thought, I'll just jump in here.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.620
 I really don't have much notes.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.940
 - Do you wanna just use like text to speech for that

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.780
 so you don't even have to talk?

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.060
 - Yes, just what that run.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.220
 - Microsoft Sam.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:49.500
 - This module sucks, period.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.820
 - What was the, what was the,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.900
 that came with the Sound Blaster card?

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.140
 - Oh, fuck.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.500
 Dr. Spade-Zo.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.340
 - Yes.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.740
 - Wow, that's a deep cut.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.220
 (both laughing)

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.540
 - That's embedded in me, Dr. Spade-Zo.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.300
 Those are magical things back then.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.460
 - You got your Sound Blaster 16 and your voodoo graphics card.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.540
 - That's pretty cool.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.740
 - Go, ready to play Unreal 99.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.620
 (both laughing)

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.820
 - But that's not what we're here to talk about.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.180
 We're here to talk about what's on your notes.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.620
 - We're putting a lot of weight on my notes.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.540
 I think it's really good.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.980
 - But like if your notes really aren't like,

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.260
 well we've already covered Sound Blaster 16.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.580
 I'm supposed to get that one.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.580
 - I'm done.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.060
 - That's half the list.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.340
 - At the top of my notes,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.220
 some of the random thoughts I had was hot topics and news.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.580
 I got Muff Wiggler's transition

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.220
 to a non-binary, non-gender conforming web form.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.340
 And is now known as Maud Wiggler.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.280
 And no one cares.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.660
 Mr. Dataline walks away from the electron.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.780
 No one cares.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.220
 But who will be the face of that company now?

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.060
 Question mark, good question.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.900
 Who knows?

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.300
 - Your heart's not in these news updates at all.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.660
 - No, these are not good news.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.820
 And I don't know, like, you know.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.580
 I mean, I'm actually pretty on board with the Muff Wiggler

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.540
 change.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.060
 I mean, I think there's no reason not to try to be more

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.900
 inclusive.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.380
 And if someone's like, I'm gonna argue with you.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.380
 - That's fine.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.220
 (laughing)

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.780
 But it's one of the things where like,

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.260
 if it's a small change, I could have a big impact

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.260
 to make people not feel like it's just a hobby for white male.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.060
 - True.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.780
 But I feel like almost every time that that has come up

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.580
 on the forums, people who aren't white males have weighed in

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.020
 and said they've never felt excluded due to the name.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.580
 It's usually the certain individuals that do that.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.420
 You know what I mean?

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.260
 - You know what I mean?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.220
 - The name I don't think was ever really offending anybody.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.060
 - That's fair.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.820
 I mean, that's certainly a separate issue

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.340
 that needs to be addressed independently than this.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.940
 But from like someone who's not a white male who's like,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.060
 "I'm interested in this," and they do a Google search

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.700
 and it's gear sluts and muff wiggler,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.100
 well, this doesn't sound like this is for me.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:07.260
 This sounds like this is for white males who think

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.260
 this is an okay way to speak.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.780
 - White males can be sluts too.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.780
 - That fair, but like that's--

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.100
 - I can't have them off.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.660
 (laughing)

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.740
 - That could all open up, mussi.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.580
 (laughing)

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.580
 - I generally don't have a retort to that.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.580
 Perhaps you have won this round.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.300
 - You just dropped a bomb on that one.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.660
 - Yeah.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.260
 If the name change does in fact make it a more inclusive

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.060
 and positive vibe overall than I'm for it,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.860
 but I don't think anyone cared much one way or the other

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.580
 except for like certain people just wanted to nitpick it.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.420
 - You know what I mean?

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.020
 - And there's gonna be assholes,

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.780
 but at least it's not on the front door, on the side.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.180
 Now you have to go inside to find out

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.100
 that half the people here are pieces of shit,

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.860
 but at least it's at least welcoming you

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.460
 past the Google search.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.740
 - I wonder do you have people even know the origin story

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.940
 some of the people complaining as to like their two

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.220
 electronic pedagl-- - Yeah.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.860
 - Pedals, the big muff and the, I forget,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.500
 voltage wiggler or something wiggler.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.900
 - Yeah.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.980
 - And the big muff, I even traced the origin

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.340
 'cause there are articles about this

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.900
 and it was because the sound was muffled.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.740
 It's why they named it the big muff.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.300
 - I'm sure at the end of the day,

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.260
 there was probably some marketing.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.140
 I was like, yeah, if there's a double entendre here,

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.140
 then nobody's gonna be like super upset.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:26.980
 - Sure.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.900
 - But you can't do that.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.460
 But yeah, wiggler and then the kind of combination,

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.220
 like Wambo, the two of them.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.700
 And the fact that Mike came up with it

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.580
 and it's his forum or was his forum,

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.100
 it's kind of like, yeah, you know,

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.580
 you kind of wanna retain it.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.140
 It feels a little weird to change it,

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.260
 but I'm over it too at first.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.340
 I was like, oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.100
 But now it's like, okay, don't care in some ways.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.180
 And also if it's like, if they wanna make it

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.100
 so it's something that nobody ever has to talk about again,

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.700
 I get it, you know.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.420
 - And I think also as time moves forward,

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.620
 our sensibilities change.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.540
 What's okay one year isn't later.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.460
 And Ardo and the way Ardo is made evolves with that.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.380
 So, you know, something 10 years ago

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.620
 may have had a different context

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.980
 or maybe wasn't as big a deal as it is now.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.540
 Well, you need to adjust with the times

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.020
 and you can either look at it and go,

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.780
 is this an improvement we can make

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:18.980
 and we wanna be a part of?

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.820
 Or can you sort of like,

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.300
 there are people that will continue to say,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.100
 like and use shitty slurs for some groups of people

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.740
 because this is, I've always used this

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.180
 or this is like other people aren't offended by it.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.780
 Like that's where you draw your line.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.260
 That's what you wanna, like,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.540
 that's the hill you wanna die on.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.740
 That's fine.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.420
 I think that's stupid.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.420
 - Yeah, I feel you.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.700
 I also just don't like the new name though too,

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.900
 'cause I just think it's just like, oh, mot, like,

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.740
 I don't know.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.580
 - It's very super nervous.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.420
 - It's super nervous.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.580
 - Yeah, that's silly.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.420
 - Yeah.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.140
 - I feel like if there was gonna be a name change

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.940
 then just fucking go all in and come up with something.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.540
 Zany, crazy, whatever the fuck, something creative.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.060
 I mean, Muffwiggler, you know,

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.620
 I guess controversial as the name can be at times

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.060
 for people, it was unique.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:04.900
 - Oh yeah.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.740
 - But, you know what I mean?

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.540
 It was something different.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.060
 It stood out from your typical Nerikaz gear form.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.900
 - Yeah.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.740
 - You know what I mean?

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.580
 - You'll still always call it like muffs.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.140
 You know, it's just so quick to call it.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.140
 You can't call it mots, it just doesn't make sense.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.300
 - You know what I mean?

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.620
 - Like, gear slots, they probably should have changed ages ago.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.220
 And that one's a little more egregious,

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.060
 but Muffwiggler's a little more like,

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.300
 oh, some of you weren't even around here too,

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.580
 like back in the day to pull the old man shit out,

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.900
 but it is kind of like a little hard to see a change.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.540
 But on the other hand, I don't give a fuck either.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.940
 If I go from having 11 goos to 11,

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.020
 like, you know, completely boring person icons though,

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.180
 I'm fucking out.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.460
 - I wonder if my goo mug that says Muffwiggler for life.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:53.020
 I wonder if that's like gonna be a collectible now.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.460
 It's gonna be worth money, man.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.820
 - Get that shwam and money.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.660
 - It's gonna be worth shwam and bucks.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.460
 I went and checked those prices again just a few weeks ago,

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.500
 and it's still ridiculous.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.820
 Nobody buys it now, but it's like even higher.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.980
 Even though they said like,

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.700
 it's cool they're actually gonna start producing the stuff again.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.260
 Yeah, and they're already servicing stuff,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.060
 so that's cool, but yeah, it's just fucking unreal.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.180
 $6,000 for a little 30 HP single voice module

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.700
 that doesn't even sound that great.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.820
 - Did you see that there's now reverb listings

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.260
 for packaging that doesn't include the product?

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.220
 Yeah, it's like original packaging for certain modules.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.260
 And it was like, it wasn't outrageous.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.580
 Let me rephrase that.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.900
 It was like 20 or 30 bucks,

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.020
 which is outrageous for what is a cardboard box

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.500
 with a stamp on it.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.020
 But I feel like that's crossing another line.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.380
 - Let's make bootleg boxes.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.380
 (laughing)

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.620
 - I mean, I save mine.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.220
 I have a box that's literally just full of module boxes,

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.140
 but yeah, you'd think that's something

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.260
 somebody could really easily counterfeit.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.820
 - Yeah, I think it's a lot of them aren't all that amazing.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.340
 They're just plain white packaging box with a stamp on it.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.740
 Like you said, some don't even have a fucking stamp.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.540
 - The syntech stuff is just white box.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.780
 - Yeah, yeah, that's what you get.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.620
 And I get it.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.460
 I probably wouldn't.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.300
 - Yeah.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.500
 And I, like, as soon as I get the box,

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.020
 I just throw there's a big shelf

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.260
 that has all the empty boxes.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.100
 And then when I sell a module,

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.900
 I just grab one that'll fit.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.460
 Like no one who's bought anything off of me off reverb.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.300
 Has the original one.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.140
 - Has the original one.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.580
 - Yeah, it's the one that fit.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.940
 - I try to always find the original when I sell it.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.740
 There's been a few times where I didn't,

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.580
 or I couldn't find it

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.580
 'cause I just had too many fucking module boxes or whatever.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.660
 So I just, yeah, slapped in whatever fit.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.420
 Especially when it comes to the mutable ones

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.940
 'cause they're all pretty much similar, you know what I mean?

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.460
 And only one time that I have somebody complain.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.300
 - Same.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.140
 - One time I had someone be like,

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.140
 "No, didn't have the original box?"

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.620
 - Yeah, they were like, "Fucking use it."

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.460
 - They were like, "This was in a,

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.940
 "I think I sent it in like a,

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.460
 "it was like a make noise.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.980
 "What's the touch thing?"

00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.820
 I forget.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.660
 - Pressure points.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.380
 - I sent it in a pressure points box 'cause I found it.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.820
 I still had one and I was like, "Oh yeah."

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.100
 Slap it in there and this guy was like,

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.860
 "Whoa, this came in a pressure points box."

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.860
 Well, I'm like, "That's okay, right?"

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:12.700
 It was like, "I guess."

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.180
 But it was like--

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.100
 - Did you stop and remind yourself,

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.540
 it's a fucking box.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.380
 - Yeah, I'm like, okay.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.900
 - That's not really what you were buying.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.100
 - I never even considered the fact

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.780
 that somebody would like have an issue with that.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.620
 You know what I mean?

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.620
 - Yeah.

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.380
 - With the way components are going, dude,

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.060
 it might be the future, man.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.380
 All these original modules might soon be like collectable.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.580
 You know, because it might not be able to get reproduced

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.340
 or shortage might impact modules overall so much.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.260
 It's kind of crazy.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.540
 - That's rad that Scott can do another piston run.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.540
 I was concerned about that and why they were so out of stock,

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.700
 but definitely want one of those Mark 3s

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.820
 like we were talking about a little.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.780
 Those look sick.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.620
 Just having that ability to CV sweep through presets

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.220
 like the Bionic Blaster 2,

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.500
 that kind of gets me excited after that live set.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.340
 - Yeah.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.180
 - That would make it so much easier to deal with stuff.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.260
 - Were you using the Luster in your live setup?

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.100
 - Yeah.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.340
 - Yeah, I had BIA and the piston Honda going into it.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.020
 Each of the channels just in low pass individually.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.500
 - Maybe we should just like weigh into that then.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.340
 - Yeah.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.220
 - Boss, I think it's boss RC 505.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.460
 They have a ton of different loopers.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.340
 They have like a 500 and like the pedal on

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.380
 and some older ones.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.900
 But the 505 is the one that Blahwan uses

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.660
 if you've seen any of those videos of him playing stuff

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.940
 and he's used it for a number of years.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:32.780
 It's not new.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.140
 It's been out since like 2013 or something.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.420
 But they just like updated it to fix stuff in October.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.420
 So you could like have it follow midi clock, not slave,

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.380
 follow midi clock and it would actually stay in time

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.780
 and not like lose it over time.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.100
 And it works super well.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.180
 Like you can just set arbitrary loop lengths.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.180
 You get five of them.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.340
 You get effects on the input and the output.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.500
 And it's definitely been a game changer.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.060
 Definitely building mine.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.860
 Live set around it with the RIDOM 7U module

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.500
 and that and just kind of dumping modular sequences.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.100
 Pretty much stealing Blahwan's steeze in a way,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.420
 but it's just like a good trick.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.980
 And as far as like modular sets,

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.060
 it seems like a nice way to capture something

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.220
 and keep it moving.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.740
 - He would not fucked with loopers deeply in the past.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.260
 - Not at all. - It's relatively new.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.420
 - Always generally avoided them or they didn't work

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.300
 when you tried to sync it to a clock.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.420
 And yeah, so this one actually does work really well.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:34.540
 I kind of like that it's a little like 90s cheesy to like the case

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.820
 and yeah, it's awesome.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.300
 Can't believe it works.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.420
 - You set effects on the inputs and outputs.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.060
 Can you have those simultaneously?

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.220
 - No, I've found out you can't actually.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.060
 You can pick three different chains of them

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.100
 and you can enable them or disable them.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.300
 They make an RC 202, which they made a number of years later

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.820
 and it's just a two channel version,

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.380
 which is still interesting.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.260
 But it's only like 200 bucks cheaper, so five versus two.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.620
 That one you get simultaneous effects.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.420
 I think they're a little more limited maybe

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.460
 or you pick them a little differently.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.420
 But it's still like, I don't know,

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.780
 that might do the trick for live stuff,

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.060
 but also having like five loops is super appealing.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.220
 And I've learned you can like back stuff up to it

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.380
 and it'll save them like as you're working.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.580
 So it's just like what I was doing with the Octatrack kind of,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.100
 but actually a little more seamless and less clicky

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.740
 as far as the looping goes and like that.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.460
 - And I'm not sure if it's your interface.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.500
 - Oh my God, that was like a multi step thing

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.900
 and it dominated the machine.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.340
 Whereas this is like you could be really drunk

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.260
 and just hit the button and it'll loop it perfectly

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.260
 and then hit it again and it'll overdub

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.020
 or play it back.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:35.860
 So.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.220
 - Pretty configurable too.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:41.820
 - Yeah, like 99 minutes of like sampling time,

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.820
 which is fucking time stereo.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.100
 - Sounds good enough, you know?

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.020
 Doesn't sound like no easier shitty.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.820
 - So are you imagining a scenario where you have it

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.220
 pre-loaded with a bunch of stuff

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.460
 or are you gonna start with like a blank slate each set?

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.620
 - Good question, I think both to some degree,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.340
 like three free ones and then two freebies maybe.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.060
 But then like, I don't know.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:03.900
 - That's a good question.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.060
 Then I'd have to like correlate them

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.940
 and I'm kind of trying to not do that.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.940
 Because before I was going on the path of my modular,

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.020
 I was like, I'm gonna make four patches in here

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.180
 and I'm gonna try to iterate through these patterns

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.700
 and like, that's a lot of setup

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.900
 and a config to remember in a live set too.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.500
 And this can be more like,

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.140
 maybe I can have some patches, but no, like all right,

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.300
 I'm done, dump this over in a four bar loop

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.100
 and then just fuck something up, keep it up

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.460
 and then get going.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.500
 So I got some practice to do,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.620
 but it's been pretty damn good so far.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.460
 - Nice, nice.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.420
 - Yet integrated, like I haven't even looked at the manual,

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.020
 except to remember how to,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.060
 you gotta do this modulation thing

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.420
 so that the loops will stop when you stop midi-clock

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.260
 if you want it to.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.900
 Otherwise it'll keep running, which you may want.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.260
 That's like a total viable thing

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.100
 I could see people wanting to do.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.620
 And then, fuck was it?

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.700
 I would like turn off the one effect.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.020
 - Yeah, it comes with like a huge phone book manual,

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.940
 but you don't really need it at all.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.300
 It's pretty fucking straightforward.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.700
 - Nice.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.540
 - Yeah.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.380
 - Totally impressed with that thing.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.700
 They did a good job.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.180
 - And these types are decent enough?

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.180
 - Yeah, totally.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.260
 There's like a low pass filter that does the job

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.580
 and sounds a little bassy when it's low.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.180
 Beat repeat, super cheesy, but awesome.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.180
 It does the trick.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.580
 And some delay in reverb, the reverb is kind of shitty,

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.060
 but you know, it's a live set.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.460
 - Can you do the thing, like, are the loops,

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.660
 do they have individual outs

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.940
 or is this all going through like the mat?

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.860
 No, okay.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.700
 - Stereo input.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.540
 - Some ideas.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.380
 - Stereo output.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.820
 - Yeah, that would be the,

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.220
 if they had multi outs on it, holy shit, that would be cool.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.580
 - I guess, if you really wanted to get crazy,

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.820
 you could have two of them.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.100
 - I've seen people do that.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:39.940
 - Okay.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.540
 I'm just thinking like mixing in between,

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.380
 you know what I mean?

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.460
 And getting real complex

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.540
 and having different gear going to one or the other,

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.380
 you know what I mean?

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.380
 And then looping in between the two.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.100
 - Yeah, you just can't just keep it simple.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:51.940
 - I know.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.340
 That's Jesus Christ is why.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.180
 - Oh, here's something really great and simple

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.100
 and intuitive.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.900
 How can I make it super cool?

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.820
 - That's what I do to it.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.180
 That's why I don't play out much

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.060
 because I end up just making shit way more overly

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.300
 fucking complicated for myself than it needs to be.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.540
 - You don't have to be on a rant.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.940
 - And then I'm not satisfied with it

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.740
 because I failed to achieve this overly complicated

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.780
 fucking plan that I have.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.300
 Nice fucker, I'm not gonna do a show.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.260
 - Actually, that makes me think it would be a good idea

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.460
 to have two of the tiny boys, two of the two channels.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.300
 - Oh, shit.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.300
 - You get the full flexibility.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.100
 - Okay, now we're talking two sets out.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.540
 - I like it and it'd be 50 bucks more.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.540
 - Yeah.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.700
 - That's not a bad idea.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.020
 - That is interesting.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.380
 - Oh my God, like the look on your face.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.940
 - I'm just like, it's just, it's the wheels.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:35.780
 Like in the, you're a little.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.660
 - Right now I'm thinking pad-based,

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.580
 maybe controller up to each one,

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:43.820
 triggering different loops or prerecorded material

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.060
 on one channel and loops, live loops on the other

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.980
 and being able to punch it in.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:49.900
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.020
 'Cause yeah, after using the looper,

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.740
 like for a couple more weeks now,

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.140
 it's still relatively new to me,

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.220
 but I'm definitely much more used to it.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.260
 It definitely, it was such a lifesaver

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.660
 and not live set for like transitions and shit like that.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.620
 Just the ability to like quick,

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.340
 you know, I played the whole set basically through the looper.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.820
 Like it's just the analog rhythm and the 7U.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.380
 Really, I'd rather than the 7U inputs like mixed in there

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.340
 than just took one output from the modular

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.940
 into the looper and then just, you know,

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.180
 you can audition it through there basically

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.780
 and then just take your loops.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.940
 And at that point you just gotta be like,

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.660
 okay, turn your volume fader down in your loop.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.140
 Take your loop, it's always perfect, which is really nice.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.940
 And then just like cut it over as you figure out

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.300
 how to deconstruct the other channels

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.380
 or get it to a point where you can dip that over

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.020
 or switch your patterns, change your modular configuration

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.300
 simply or whatever and then move.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.780
 And that worked out like super fucking well.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.300
 And I also realized too, I'd like having some loops on there

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.460
 to like just some presets to be like,

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.420
 okay, I know there's like this high hat pattern

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.580
 with like a low base that I can throw on top

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.900
 of like a kick drum pattern.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.580
 If I think it's like a little underweight

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.580
 or something like that.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.740
 - Oh, so it's like a full like part of the song.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.660
 - Yeah, yeah, some of that stuff was.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.660
 Or like that's the thing that I had to practice

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:07.260
 is like you can get into a rhythm where you like,

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.460
 get your basic drum loop you wanna have,

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.060
 like loop that up because you're looping everything

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:12.900
 through the looper.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.100
 So if you want something to be separate,

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.540
 you've got to loop it separately and not have it playing

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.020
 'cause otherwise you'll be in the situation like,

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.700
 oh, I just wanna loop the drums, but I have the whole mix

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.580
 playing, but it's gonna sound like dicks

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.540
 if I like just cut that out right now and take a loop.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.620
 So that's like part of the strategy I had to like

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.140
 bake into my brain a little.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.580
 But you can also just at the end of the day be like,

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:32.860
 all right, I'm just gonna loop everything

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.820
 and get out of this.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.460
 So there's like that strategy too,

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.300
 which I used to do on the octet track,

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.180
 but like always kind of didn't work or,

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.340
 yeah, just this is so much easier.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.860
 And then the ability to like affect that

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.700
 and have like sync like filter,

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.700
 shit like that, which is just,

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.300
 it was a lot of fun in that live context to be able

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.300
 to just filter shit down a little bit on the modular

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.380
 and on that looper.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.980
 So yeah, it's like, I love it.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.820
 Like I can see myself just getting better at it over time.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.260
 And even as I was practicing at first,

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.420
 it was just like one bar loop.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.540
 So then it was like two one bar loops,

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.180
 two bar loop and a four, and then two ones,

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.540
 a two, a four and an eight.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.980
 And I kind of like that set up

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.100
 'cause like you can just take an eight bar loop,

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.700
 do like a longer melodic thing, dump that off quick.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.980
 And then all right, now I can like reset the modular,

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.180
 which is where that Harlequin's context comes into play too,

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.940
 'cause then it's like, all right,

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.500
 I know these like presets on Platts

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.700
 will change these modes or like,

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.540
 I did like a chord progression with it

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.300
 on the Platts chord machine using like the harmonic parameter.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.300
 I think harmonic or timber,

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.020
 whichever fucking one changes that.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.020
 I think what's the third parameter?

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:41.860
 I don't remember.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.700
 Harmonic, there's timber, harmonics, frequency, more.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.540
 More, more, more.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.380
 That's a thank you.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.540
 Yeah, yeah, but more if you can more

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.500
 like the chord shape.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.740
 I'll cut out us not remembering the word more.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.100
 Oh no, it's one of the two.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.100
 We all use three of them.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.300
 Well, that's the thing, like I just,

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.660
 I have it all memorized.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.500
 I don't know if you can remember

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.020
 look to see what's what on there.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.100
 'Cause I just like know what does what, you know?

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.100
 It's bottom right.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.900
 Yeah.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:14.900
 So we, I remember asking you this at the show,

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.980
 but you were using Harlequin's context

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.220
 to even change the like the mode.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.500
 Like you basically had like a full like plats preset scene

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.260
 set up in a, as you could just pop to that and like.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.100
 Totally.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.940
 Everything was just set up.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.180
 I did a really simply where I had those three chord variations

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.780
 and I had the fourth one that was not.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.100
 It was I think FM or one of the other ones

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.420
 to a certain parameter.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.620
 And then I had like harmonic and timber

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.660
 were the other two knobs.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.220
 I think the fourth one was just open

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.300
 'cause I changed like my patch at the end of it

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.100
 just to not use something.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.620
 For our listener's sake and my own since I'm not too familiar

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.460
 with it.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.620
 What is the Harlequin?

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.980
 Oh yeah, that's a good point.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.380
 So it's basically, it does a bunch of things

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.580
 but it's most basic.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.700
 It's like a static voltage preset.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.540
 So you get like four knobs that correspond to four outputs

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.820
 that are just offsets.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.660
 So you can create like a preset basically

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.980
 and then you have four buttons underneath that

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.220
 that you can switch between.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.700
 But on the other level, you get like four sets of four buttons.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.860
 So you get like 16 things you can switch through.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.660
 And then there are other modes where you can actually

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.460
 turn those into modulators too.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.100
 You can have them be little envelopes on each one

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.620
 or LFOs are like a mix on each one.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.980
 And there's a gate and CV input.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.100
 Yes.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:33.020
 So it's kind of like poly and preset but like more compact.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:33.860
 Exactly.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.620
 Like a forebanger or okay.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.860
 And you can sequence through those with that CV gate.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.540
 They're like a bunch of different modes too.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.220
 It's like one of those things where it's really cool

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.380
 in that I was using it within like 10 minutes of having it.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.540
 Like okay, like this is the basic mode.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.460
 But then there are these other like hidden modes

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.460
 that you don't have to fuck with

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.580
 but you can step through each of those scenes

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.900
 for the four parameters, which is cool.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.220
 And this is what also got me on the select bus shit

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.020
 'cause it uses that select bus stuff

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.380
 that like the varigate eight and the varigate four

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.620
 and some other things do like the Renee I think does it too.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.060
 Where you can have one, you get up two of them

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.700
 and have one be leader and one be follower

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.020
 and have like eight knobs.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.220
 And then just as you go through the presets, it'll switch

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.420
 or as you change your varigate eight pattern,

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:22.020
 it'll switch all of those presets on the Harlequin's context

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.820
 and know which thing to go to.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.700
 I think the metron does that shit too.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.140
 I've been like eyeing that up even.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.900
 I'm glad it doesn't do pitch.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.660
 I know this is derail but that metron looks sick

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.900
 but it doesn't do pitch without those little expanders

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.260
 and I'm just not into it.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.620
 So based on the, you're describing the Harlequin's context

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.420
 and like me watching like one video

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.060
 and I think it was like, I forget who did the video.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.620
 It may have been from ShackMat.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.940
 - Yeah, it was good.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.100
 - I just ordered it right away.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.020
 I've not had a lot of time to play with it yet.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:50.860
 - Who makes it?

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:51.700
 - ShackMat.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:52.540
 - ShackMat.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.380
 - There's stuff is cool.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.220
 - Yeah, ShackMat is a monitor.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.420
 - This is free build or a kit.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.260
 Both, you can get either.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.180
 I got it pre-built because I don't think any kits

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.620
 were available, they just made them available like this week.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.620
 - Yeah, I couldn't find any kits.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.060
 - They do that like Bishops missile laney.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.500
 They have a bunch of like weird ones.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.500
 That one's like drum sequencing I think

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.340
 or like something else.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.780
 - I've had a couple of those one you ones.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:12.620
 - Odd one you.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.620
 - Yeah, they have some good ones like that.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.540
 - There's one like a clock divider.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.380
 - That's it, yeah.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.620
 - There's like an octave one that I might get.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.940
 'Cause I've been into that a little bit.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:24.220
 - Yeah, I was looking into the octave one too.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.500
 - I've been like in the, I used that VPME.DE,

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.060
 like octave and semitone switch are a lot last night.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.780
 That was anytime there was like a melodic transposition,

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.340
 it was doing that with those switches,

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.980
 which seems like it's so like,

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.580
 feels like un-musical at the end of the day.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.340
 So I'm using this little mechanical switch

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.260
 to like make a melody, but fuck it.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.100
 - It sounded good.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.700
 Was it quantized?

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.660
 - Yeah, it did run into the,

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.660
 that was the hysteria VCO with the quantize on.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.500
 - Okay. - I finally remember

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.060
 to turn it on 'cause it won't remember it

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.300
 through power cycle.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.620
 I was like, "Ooh, that's sour."

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.780
 Like, "Oh fuck, I get into the red button."

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.740
 And then it tightened it up.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.820
 - 'Cause there was none of that when you were playing last night.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.260
 It was just progressing very nicely.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.500
 And I was like, "Damn, that sounds really good."

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.420
 It didn't have that sort of a micro-tonal vibe to it.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.100
 - Yeah, I practiced that for a while too.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.660
 There was like a specific switches I had to have.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.620
 And I even put like,

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.660
 you know, those little LED cover stickers?

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.260
 Like I was putting white ones of those on like certain modules,

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.380
 like at certain positions.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.220
 So I could remember like,

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.500
 "Oh yeah, it's this like in the middle of these seven switches.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.540
 Like this one's octave up and down or something like that."

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.460
 But to take it all the way back to the looper,

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.660
 they need to make another version of that looper.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.700
 It's like so close.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.820
 They're like, put a better screen on it.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.580
 Like a little like different effects.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.860
 Like there's some flaws too.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.900
 Like when you switch effects, you can't like,

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.900
 I don't know what the delay value is.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.140
 I just, I even use like little pieces of paper

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.340
 on the knob position to be like,

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.220
 "Oh, this is where like I think quarter clock delay is."

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.220
 Or something like that.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.900
 So there's a little shit like that

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.460
 they could make it a lot nicer.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.860
 Yeah.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.860
 I don't know, loopers fucking tight though.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.140
 I definitely like it in the live set.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.020
 I couldn't imagine playing without one now.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.940
 - So now that you're like fired up for loopers,

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.580
 is, have you looked at other ones?

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.140
 Or is this the one that like you're stuck with?

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:05.980
 - It's the best one.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:06.820
 - I don't know what to look like with.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.780
 But like you're sold on this one.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:09.620
 - Yeah.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.740
 I was even using the one in the ER 301 for a while.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.380
 There was a while where I had a version of the set

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.540
 that didn't have the looper.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.300
 'Cause I was like, "Oh, I just want to be more compact.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.300
 This is too much shit."

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.900
 But in the end, it's like,

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.940
 it's just so nice to have that thing.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.340
 Like I just smash this button and it takes the loop.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.900
 It's like hard to get away from that.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.740
 You know, it's so simple.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.580
 - So Greg.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.420
 - Yeah.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.420
 - What else is on your list?

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.060
 - Oh geez, my list.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:31.900
 - You're a little bit-- - What a list.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.980
 - I don't have a list bro.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.460
 - I don't have a list.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:37.900
 Nick didn't bring a list. - I didn't, I don't have a list.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:38.900
 - You had a list of three drinks.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.740
 - I was just trying to close it.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.580
 - You can't close it.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.900
 - This is true.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.740
 - Did you close your list?

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:43.580
 - I did.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.660
 On accident.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.500
 - Okay.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.220
 - I gotta know where you are.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.540
 - What else is on my list?

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.060
 Oh yeah, a little note from last episode.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.380
 The make noise straga.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.220
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.060
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.100
 So last episode.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:58.940
 - We were not fans.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.900
 We were not enthusiastic.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:00.740
 - Yeah.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.540
 - Someone might be flip-flop.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.700
 - Oh, I had a lot of criticisms.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.700
 - I had a lot of criticisms.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.460
 I had a lot of criticisms about it.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.180
 The steep price tag, right?

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:15.580
 The purposely obstrused panel and marketing verbiage.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:16.580
 Check.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:21.580
 And the quarantini worship aspect of it all, right?

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.860
 Now here we are a few months later.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.220
 - We know it's gone.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.700
 - I feel the same way about all of that.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.140
 - Oh!

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.700
 That was an M9 chemele on twist.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.980
 - Ah, to least.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.820
 - I pulled the rug out.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.700
 - I really thought this was going somewhere different.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.460
 I thought you were gonna reach down underneath the counter

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.980
 and pull out like you had one.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:40.900
 - That would have been sick.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:45.180
 - I bought one.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.220
 - I kind of want to.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:52.100
 Like the criticism I have, I still feel the same about.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.460
 However, over the last couple months,

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.300
 since the last episode, there's been a few demos

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:01.300
 and overviews of it on YouTube.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.580
 The demos especially have kind of opened my eyes to it.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.180
 There's a couple of people that are making things with it

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.700
 that don't just sound like quartini in a box.

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:12.420
 People are starting to get a little creative with it.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.020
 And I'm starting to like warm up to it a little bit.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:21.900
 It seems like as far as like a highly portable semi-modular

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:27.980
 noise drone box, it would be nice.

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.580
 You know, in a live setup.

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.500
 I probably wouldn't have too much use for it in the studio,

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.740
 but I can definitely see it be appealing to me

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:35.740
 for a live setup.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:40.260
 It's just that price tag is the only reason why I haven't

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.100
 bought one.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.020
 I'm kind of digging the sound, but it's hard to justify $600.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.140
 - Yeah.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.980
 - For that, when there's a lot of other things out there

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.060
 that you can get for $600.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:51.900
 - Yeah.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.300
 - That are a little.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.540
 - And look, we talked about last time.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.740
 Like you could make something that you wanted to do.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.100
 Replicate a lot of that.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:34:59.940
 - Right.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:00.780
 - Sure.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.940
 - And get more precisely what you're looking for.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.900
 - Like those dread box modules that you even,

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.740
 - Yeah.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.420
 - Like those are like what, $99 a piece?

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.260
 - $99 bucks each.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.540
 - And you can get the delay, the filter, the VCO

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.820
 and probably be very close to strike territory

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.620
 minus the touch points and things like that.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:15.460
 - Like the oscillator.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.300
 - Yeah.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.140
 It sounded good.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.060
 - Yeah, I dig it.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.340
 That module was.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.820
 - So much CV control too.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.260
 They're like patched out really nicely.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.180
 - Yeah, I would like to look more into those,

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.260
 especially now that I'm on a tight budget

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.420
 for the next several months.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.260
 - You know what I mean?

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.860
 It's like any modules that I get it,

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.260
 they're gonna have to be cheap or used or both.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.340
 - Yeah, especially if someone was getting into module,

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.820
 I think those would be a great start

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.180
 'cause there's 99 bucks for the like dual VCA

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.420
 and filter too.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.500
 I don't know if it's dual, but like that was too,

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.380
 like that plus the oscillator,

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.460
 like that's pretty cool for 200 bucks.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.300
 - Right.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.420
 - I'd much rather go that route over a baringer.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.580
 - Oh yeah, fuck yeah.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.740
 - For like cheap starter modules.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.940
 - No question.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:04.940
 - Just your average East Coast style synth modules.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.820
 - And like Pittsburgh kinda had that area for a while.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:09.660
 - Yeah.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.220
 - Of like this sort of like inexpensive,

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.900
 like a G-boss later, G-filter, G-VCA.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:19.540
 But it seemed like they've switched gears.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.740
 - I mean, Dopher is still a solid choice too.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.580
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.140
 - I don't mean to roll them out,

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.540
 but at the same time, like not a whole lot of people

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.620
 carry them, you know what I mean?

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.940
 And they have so many choices now

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.220
 that it's kind of overwhelming.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:37.180
 Like their stuff is so broken out, per module, you know what I mean?

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.980
 - There's like a lot of like dash X

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.820
 or there's a lot of like variations on existing ones

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.140
 and it was like, oh wait, which one of these do I want?

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.460
 - Yeah, I mean, it can be confusing to us,

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.580
 you know, who's been fucking with this shit for years now.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.740
 You know, I can't imagine someone who's new jumping in

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.380
 being like, well, I'm gonna go all Dopher

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.620
 and, you know, take a look at their lineups, see what we're getting.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.620
 It's just gonna be fucking overwhelming, I'm sure, and confusing.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.420
 - I don't like the way they look with the layouts,

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.420
 but they do sound new generally.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.740
 - That too, yeah, they do have a static of them, yeah.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.220
 - The Barringer ones, someone that we know

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:13.300
 that has a ton of them, like if you have an issue with one,

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.140
 they'll straight up just send you a new one.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.540
 They were like, oh, don't even send the other one back.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.900
 Just like, here you go.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.100
 - Like that's how like a Palm Pilot, like that level of just like,

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.780
 it's not worth trying to fix it.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.020
 - Just take two more.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:30.380
 - It's just like, the Dredbox ones, like they sound great,

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.380
 they look great, yeah, I like those colorful panels.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.220
 - Good too.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.460
 - Everything's like a unique color,

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.780
 so you can tell the modules apart from each other,

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.420
 and they just seem to, I don't know, they're just more appealing.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.340
 - Mm-hmm, my only complaint with them,

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:48.340
 it's not too big is that they do jacks on the top and the bottom.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.660
 Instead of just having like the jack field

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.940
 at the top or the bottom.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.260
 - Sure, but it's, they're still like,

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.100
 so nice to use in the slider, so like really,

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.460
 I don't know, I love the thing, it's cool.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.380
 - So ultimately you're not gonna get Strega.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.180
 - If I can find one used in the near future,

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:08.340
 I would buy it probably, you know, at a decent discounted price.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.100
 I don't think I would ever pay retail for that,

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.100
 for what it is, or something.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.020
 - So fast forward to the next episode where we show up

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.340
 and you've got two of us,

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.500
 - Yeah. - Just taking it right now

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.660
 and see if they're used Stregas.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:23.860
 - I saw one pop up on Wiggler.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.900
 I'm just gonna call it Wiggler.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.740
 - Yeah.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.020
 - 570.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.460
 - It's so quick.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:32.980
 - Oh, there's one on Reverb too.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.420
 I always like neglect Reverb.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.580
 - Oh yeah, there's the gouge, it's so Reverb.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.780
 There's the one for $811 with $50 shipping.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:42.900
 - Nice, yeah, I'll buy that one.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.420
 - Pre-order for the full price and then there's an actual 570,

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.180
 one that'll be gone in like the next refresh.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.500
 - I mean, if that one's more than retail,

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.380
 it's probably got like some Cortini sperm on it or something.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.260
 - Right, yeah.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.900
 - It's, that one's extra magical.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.020
 It's got that extra Cortini alchemy.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:01.940
 - You lick the inside of the case.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.420
 - What else on this list?

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.940
 We barely made a dent.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.420
 - We made a big dent.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:13.820
 Aside from that, I just have some stats of the SSF.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:18.580
 AKA Steady State Fate, the TripTic.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.660
 - That's what the basic had a hand in this.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.500
 - Yes, sir.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.540
 - Our homey basic.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.900
 - Yeah.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.780
 - And also someone who I'm not familiar with,

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.940
 boy's noise.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:35.300
 - Oh yeah, they're like a pretty relatively popular

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.300
 like techno and a group.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.140
 - Yeah.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:38.980
 - Boy's noise.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.180
 - Techno, huh?

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.020
 - Yeah, believe so.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.740
 - I heard the kids are into the techno's these days.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.580
 - Some of them are.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.220
 - Yeah, I don't know, it's kind of neat.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.060
 - You know, mainly grabbed my attention

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.780
 'cause it was, you know, the basic,

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.060
 collab, and I was like, okay, what the fuck's he doing?

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.860
 - Maybe techno's a stretch.

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.020
 - Yeah, what is it?

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:58.860
 - And we're like.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.940
 - He's like remixed snoop in some other people,

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.780
 so it's probably not like.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.100
 - Oh, okay, so like EDM-ish.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.420
 - Does it genre's electro house, techno and acid house?

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.540
 - So it's probably like a little more EDM.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.580
 - That is why I am unfamiliar,

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.300
 'cause that is not my wheelhouse.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.180
 - Same.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.300
 - Okay.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.140
 Fair enough.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.220
 - Sorry.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.540
 (laughs)

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.380
 - Don't be, I'm just curious.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:28.260
 At a glance, it looked just like a filter/distortion.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.700
 I was like, okay.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.860
 And then I saw the price and I said,

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.020
 why the fuck is a filter/distortion module?

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.940
 That expensive.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.780
 So I looked into the stats a bit more.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.340
 - 400?

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.580
 - Yeah, 399.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:48.060
 So a $400 filter with distortion.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.500
 Like that seems a little steep.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.940
 It's multi-mode filter, low pass, band pass,

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.580
 and high pass, 12 dB slope.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:01.220
 The filter you can reroute,

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:06.060
 to either be at the input stage after the input VCA,

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.140
 or at the end of the stage right before the output VCA.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.460
 - Okay, that's okay.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.860
 That's a nice little touch.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:12.700
 - Mm-hmm.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:18.700
 - And then it also has an effects circuit,

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.220
 which is a flange delay,

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:27.780
 flange delay and comb filter.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.700
 - You just pick one or they serialize?

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.660
 - It's like all in one, I think,

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.820
 depending on where you have it.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:34.660
 - I'm here.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:35.820
 - I mean, there's a few knobs

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.660
 that change different states of it,

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:41.100
 but you can't have it through all three simultaneous.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.860
 It's like all part of the same circuit.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.860
 And it's a BBD circuit, essentially.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:53.580
 They said that it's a BBD circuit

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:58.380
 that accentuates the clock noise

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.700
 instead of filtering it or suppressing it.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:04.020
 They kept the clock noise in there,

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.260
 and they said it has a quality to it

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.860
 that enhances higher frequency harmonics.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.180
 - Yeah.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:16.860
 - So it seems like it's meant to add a little magic,

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.700
 I guess, to the distortion.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.540
 - Yeah.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.540
 - Which is kind of cool.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.380
 - Yeah.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:26.580
 - The distortion itself has two different modes.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:30.100
 Fold and clip or refractal fold and clip.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:36.620
 The first fold and clip saturates the input signal

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.420
 before folding it over into itself and hard clips,

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.860
 which is pretty standard.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.900
 And then the refractal fold clip saturates

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.180
 and then gently folds and does some trickery

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:51.220
 where the refractory peak forms rebounds

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.380
 into the opposite direction before hard clipping

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.900
 and results in more gain.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.180
 I'm not really sure what that's all about, but I'm curious.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.020
 - Yeah.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:01.860
 - Okay.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.580
 And more gain is always nice.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.420
 - Right, right.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.700
 - And a distortion box.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:13.540
 The flange comb delay BBD circuit has two different modes,

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:18.740
 called high and low.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:22.380
 The low mode has a wider range for the delay effects.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.620
 I guess you can get longer times out of it,

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.620
 but it's still pretty tight from what I was reading,

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.580
 like longer-ish tones, I should say.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:29.420
 - Okay.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.300
 - And then the high includes a broader spectrum

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.520
 for comb filtering specifically.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.940
 So it's kind of neat.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.860
 I'm a little disappointed that it's monophonic.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.980
 - That is a bummer, yeah.

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.060
 - For the price, I would kind of expected,

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.840
 you know, some stereo outs.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.780
 And it's SSF, which already has a stereo filter.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.900
 They got the D-pole.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.740
 - Yeah, right.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.900
 - Which costs the same.

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.140
 So, wow.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:57.220
 - Yeah.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.220
 Some kind of surprise I didn't like work

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.620
 some of that, you know, features into this.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.820
 - It may have also really increased the price though.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:05.940
 - Mm.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.860
 - Yeah, honestly though, if you're already hitting

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.020
 that $400 mark for a fucking filter,

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.660
 I feel like people would probably be willing

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.860
 to send a few extra bucks for a stereo version of it.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.340
 I know I would, you know what I mean?

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.420
 If I was already going that direction,

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.900
 and yeah, the stereo would probably pull me in.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.900
 Like, if it was what, $4.99 instead of $3.99

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.300
 to have a stereo version of it,

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.780
 it would be that much more useful to me.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:29.620
 You know what I mean?

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.780
 To be able to route stereo signals through all that.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:32.660
 - Right, yeah.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.060
 - Whereas weirdly, I would still like

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.140
 the industrial music.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.140
 - I heard, and what is it?

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.580
 British noise electronics, the grit filter is like--

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:41.420
 - That's at the same price.

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:43.700
 - The same price, $3.99, yeah.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.140
 That was, you're on the same page as me.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.460
 I was just about to say that, like,

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.940
 if I'm about to drop $400 on a filter,

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.660
 I would probably be leaning more towards

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.700
 the British noise electronics, yeah.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:58.380
 I mean, it lacks that, you know, the BBD circuit,

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.700
 but it has some really nice gain staging

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.020
 and characteristics and the demos that I've heard at least.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.700
 - Parallel saturation stuff, the sound of it overall

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.660
 is fucking very appealing to me.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:09.780
 - I would, if you had it.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.980
 - Yeah, if I had $400 burning a hole in my pocket,

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:17.740
 I'd be torn between the grit and the triptych, I think.

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:18.740
 You know what I mean?

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:22.660
 I had it in a cart today for 360,

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:23.500
 'cause the Memorial Day--

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.340
 - Digital material day.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.180
 - So did I, dude.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.900
 And that's what got me looking into the triptych.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.020
 So I was like, oh, both of these are cool.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.220
 I can't really afford either.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:31.740
 I don't know why I'm looking at this,

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.540
 but yeah, I had it in my cart.

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.700
 I was like, that Memorial Day sale price looks a lot nicer,

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.540
 but yeah.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.180
 - Yeah, 'cause they were super hard to get,

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.900
 and then all of a sudden, perfect circuit

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.020
 got a bunch of them.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.140
 - And Detroit modular also.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.140
 - Yeah.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.940
 - They're in stock and on sale,

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.940
 and free shipping would be here in two days.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:52.980
 Yeah, that was the--

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.140
 - No, that was what I was doing.

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.220
 - I mean, you're practically leaving money on the table.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:58.460
 (laughing)

00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.300
 - Look at this.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.660
 It is, like earlier today, I was like,

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.340
 yeah, that would've been fun to use at the show.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.380
 It just sounds like this quality,

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.060
 you know, the quality of it sounds really good.

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:09.900
 - It does.

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.860
 It's not quite over-stayer,

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.820
 but it reminds me of some of the game staging type of

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.900
 fuck shit up levels I can get out of the over-stayer.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.860
 You know, I'm like, that's kind of convenient to have

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:22.860
 and a little module,

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.820
 'cause I only have one over-stayer,

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.820
 and sometimes I wish I had multiples

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.780
 to achieve that effect, you know what I mean?

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.780
 And I'm like, if I had that and the over-stayer

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.340
 routing two of the things simultaneously,

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:34.180
 that'd be nice.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:38.700
 Yeah, it's a nice filter.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.460
 And that's the thing about the Triptych II,

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:43.340
 is that I haven't really been blown away by the demo so far.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.500
 A lot of it, I mean, it sounds good,

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.100
 but it's not blowing me away.

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.100
 I'm not like, oh, that thing has a very specific character.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:51.940
 You know what I mean?

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.380
 Like even with the BBD circuit,

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.060
 like it just kind of reminds me of something

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.260
 I've done many times before,

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.740
 and that's a tight delay through a distortion,

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:01.580
 you know what I mean?

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:02.700
 It's a very familiar sound.

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:03.900
 Yeah.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.340
 And that's cool, I guess, that you have it all in one,

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.420
 but I don't really need that.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.660
 I'm more interested in a very unique characteristic

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.020
 to my distortion, you know what I mean?

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.980
 I wonder, I'm kind of curious if they either

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:19.060
 of the people involved did like circuit designer,

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.220
 if they were just like features,

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.940
 like we want this, this, and this,

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.340
 and they were like, all right, we can knock that together

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.540
 and put it behind this panel,

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.620
 'cause it looks like the panel's kind of similar

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.900
 to the new thing they did, the Vorda.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.940
 Vorda CUS or whatever.

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.940
 Very similar, like no, I'll play out, I think.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.780
 Yeah.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.220
 So I wondered if they kind of lifted that,

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.660
 like, okay, we can make this at this price,

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.260
 'cause we can just use these panels

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.900
 and put a new screen print on it.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.580
 Yeah, I was just curious about what level

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.060
 their involvement was as well.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:52.060
 It kind of reminds me of the WMD trash master,

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.980
 'cause that was a collabo with some industrial dudes too.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:56.820
 That's right.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.620
 Name I'm drawing a blank on all of a sudden.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.540
 Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.580
 But yeah, they apparently had a lot of input

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.100
 on the design of that thing overall,

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:11.020
 including the, what is it, the Screamer Tube circuit

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.220
 that's in there.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.660
 I didn't know this, I didn't know this was a collaboration.

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:15.540
 That's.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:16.660
 Triptych or trash master?

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.500
 Trash master.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:18.340
 Oh really?

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.780
 Yeah, yeah, it was a collab.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:20.820
 Mastercraft.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.140
 Mastercraft, that's it, yeah.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:25.940
 I wasn't too familiar with their music.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:29.900
 I learned a little more about them after getting a trash master

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.140
 and being like, yeah, if I was gonna design

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.540
 a filter distortion, this would be pretty close to it.

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:35.380
 You know what I mean?

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.220
 Yeah, yeah.

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.340
 I still love my trash master.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.620
 I only have one in my rig now at this time.

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:43.220
 I did have two at one point, but it's still like,

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.620
 it's just like a staple in my setup at this point.

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.140
 Did you get a black panel for it?

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:47.980
 I did.

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:48.820
 Nice.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:49.900
 Finally, fucking finally, man.

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.980
 I was always hoping that they would do that.

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:58.980
 At first, they said no, and then now they have black panels

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.020
 available pretty much everything.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:01.860
 Yeah.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.380
 So I got them, yeah.

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:06.340
 Every WMD module I have now is a black panel.

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.180
 Redid them all.

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.900
 I noticed a few people go in default.

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:11.060
 I think noise engineering's default black now

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.220
 and maybe these continuing silver.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:16.060
 I think WMD is default now as well.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:19.220
 I will say it's much easier like in the low light situation.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:20.820
 I have those like red lights.

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:21.940
 Yeah.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.660
 And you can read the text pretty clearly with those.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:26.740
 It's hard with even regular light.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.340
 I just ended up not using that one.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.700
 Black panels are definitely shit.

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:34.660
 That's the only bummer about Harlequin's context.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:35.500
 Yeah.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.500
 I don't think they're doing black panels.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.300
 And I've got a couple of modules where I'm like,

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.980
 I'll just scratch this off and just paint my own module.

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.140
 But that has way too much text and things that I need to read.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.860
 So it's probably gonna be silver until...

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:50.700
 Do they?

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.300
 They don't do black panels at all, do they?

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:53.140
 I look.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:53.980
 No, and like...

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:54.740
 They should.

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:55.580
 They should.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:56.580
 It'd be so easy.

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:59.220
 And even keeping the weird, like,

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.380
 like, gradiated lines on them.

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.540
 Putting those, making those, like,

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.420
 gray or white on black panel.

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:06.540
 If they're listening.

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.300
 Yeah, please.

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.140
 So nice.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:13.980
 And it's also the one not black panel in my, like, live setup.

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.380
 And so now it's just like the Ujai sword.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.220
 Mine's bunched.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.100
 There's a lot more silver that crept in for me.

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.860
 Like the Tangle quartet, the piston,

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:24.260
 Honda and, you know, bionic blaster.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.100
 So it's a little spotier for me now.

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.340
 It was close.

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.660
 My Tangle's in the 7U.

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:33.540
 And I got the dual VCA,

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:37.420
 which is like the two-channel veils from after later.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.420
 That's what I've been using.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:39.260
 Oh, cool.

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:40.100
 Yeah.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.100
 'Cause I only need two voices in the live,

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.100
 the palette.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.660
 Yeah.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:45.900
 And combines them.

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:46.740
 So...

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:48.620
 Actually, that's wrong.

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.540
 I had the Metron.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.380
 What is it?

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.460
 WMD SSF one that was used in the Tangle quartet.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.060
 'Cause the mute switches, which are so nice live.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:00.180
 That's the thing you don't have mute switches in the Tangle.

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.020
 True.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:04.580
 The one thing I would want to add, but I get why it's not there.

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:06.980
 Effects aid, Igor added to the effects aid today,

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.300
 which was like waking up and getting a present.

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.500
 Seeing like, oh yeah, you can see V through the presets.

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.820
 It's like fucking right, you can't.

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:13.980
 That's a stun.

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:14.820
 And now how do you get to--

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.740
 Through the Harlequin outputs automatically right now.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.180
 So how do you get to that though?

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:21.780
 'Cause you've got the, at least with the,

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.340
 actually either version, how do you specify

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:25.940
 that you want to use a CV for that moment?

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:30.140
 It's the same way that you specify CV for the other inputs now.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.500
 You know there's like, I think you hold the--

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.940
 You hold it and then you get the option,

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.500
 and it's one of three.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.700
 That lines up with the knobs.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:41.820
 Is there like another setting now?

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.700
 Yeah, I didn't check fully, but I just, I don't know.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.020
 That's how you're going to do it.

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.140
 Okay.

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:47.980
 No, that's amazing.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:48.980
 Yeah.

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.620
 Especially, it is pretty seamless going between them.

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.700
 Oh, I think it's the sample rate input that'll do it too.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:55.540
 Oh, okay.

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:56.380
 Which is good, yeah.

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:57.220
 It's like, that is like a cool effect,

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:59.660
 but it's not one that I've used often for like music.

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:02.060
 I'm like, oh, I can, yeah, it's just novel.

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:02.900
 Right, right.

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:05.660
 So yeah, that would be sick.

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.380
 FX-A just keeps getting better and better.

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:08.900
 Greg definitely does.

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.340
 Yeah, I need to get a couple.

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:15.340
 Yeah, I'm a two and I've almost bought a third.

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.940
 Really is amazing.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:21.940
 I've been content with my noise engineering,

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:25.380
 versus yours so far.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.180
 I have two of them now.

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.020
 Oh, cool.

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.500
 Playing with different firmware is all of them.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.340
 Oh, that's cool.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.340
 I can't remember if I dipped into this in the last episode.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.540
 I think we touched on it a little bit.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:35.620
 We did talk about it.

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.180
 I don't think we talked about the alternate firmware,

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.100
 so I think that's cool.

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.020
 Yeah, I'll have to say it for a later date,

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.540
 'cause I didn't really prepare for that.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.700
 And it's been a minute since I touched on it,

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:45.220
 I've been busy moving and shit, but.

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.620
 So you just teased it.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:47.900
 You're teasing, yeah.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.020
 Tusing you, dude.

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.460
 Gotta keep you on edge.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:51.300
 Coming.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:52.140
 Gotta keep you wanting.

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:52.980
 Some of the two thousand.

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:54.940
 (laughs)

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.340
 But yeah, I've been playing with the alternative firmware,

00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:01.220
 as one is a stereo distortion, which is quite nice.

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.060
 Oh, cool.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:06.180
 And the other one is a different configuration

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:09.220
 of like reverb and stuff, and it's neat.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.060
 And there's a new one I'm gonna fuck with

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:15.900
 that I saw on Muff's or Mod or whatever the fuck today.

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.140
 It's a third party firmware.

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:18.180
 This guy's been working on.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.220
 Oh, I heard about that.

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.580
 It's a multi-effect.

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.860
 Oh, yeah, it's kinda cool.

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.860
 It's got like stereo filter,

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.780
 it's got a couple different reverbs,

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:30.780
 it's got his own take on the Panharmonium,

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:37.860
 which I recently sold to help get money to move,

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.180
 and I'm missing it, and I'm like, well, holy shit.

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.900
 I can get like, I mean, it's a stripped down version

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.820
 of Panharmonium, but the way he described it,

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.100
 it's to do the type of shit that I was doing

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.580
 with the Panharmonium anyways.

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:52.340
 So if I can get like a poor man's version of that

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.540
 on my Versio for free, fuck yeah.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:55.380
 Yeah, that's awesome.

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:56.220
 Yeah.

00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:00.860
 I feel bad now that I don't have the guy's name at hand

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.340
 to give him a shout out, but yeah,

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.380
 there's a whole thread on Muff's right now

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:09.260
 with this guy discussing like the development of it,

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:11.060
 you know, as it progresses.

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:11.900
 Oh, that's cool.

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.460
 It's reached version 0.4 today.

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.820
 Added some enhancements.

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:22.300
 I think it's like six or seven or eight different effects

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.460
 you can pull up on it.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.300
 Oh, that's cool.

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.140
 Yeah.

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.460
 Yeah.

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:33.140
 The only alternative firmware that I fucked with recently

00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:35.740
 is put hemispheres on ornament crime.

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:36.580
 Oh, right.

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:41.020
 So I liked ornament crime,

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.660
 but I always felt like I was only getting like 90% of it

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.020
 because there was just that last bit

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:50.260
 that was just so fucking academic and dense that I was like,

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:53.380
 and I would like screw with it and be like,

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:56.500
 that sounds kind of cool, but this is just,

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.780
 just that bridge too far from like,

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.260
 I'm like, I'm not fully grokhing this.

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.220
 It was awesome, but I was like,

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:05.900
 I'm just not getting as much out of as I could.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:10.580
 So hemispheres is like a lot of the cool stuff

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:12.020
 that's in ornament and crime,

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:14.060
 but without that sort of just like that last bit

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:19.060
 of like academic chin scratching density and ever,

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:23.260
 but also adding a lot of just like a ton of simple stuff.

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:26.340
 And like the way that I think about it is like,

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:30.380
 it's like a cross between like a distinct and warrior wear.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.500
 Like you just have a bunch of these things

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.860
 and they're all like kind of stripped down

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.540
 'cause you only have like the one button to control.

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:41.260
 Like basically like you have the push and the knob

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:43.980
 and but now it's separated for the A and the B.

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:44.820
 - Yeah.

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.020
 - And yeah, and you can like switch between them

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.980
 and all of the inputs are halved.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:52.100
 Like the, you know, like the two CV and the two gates are for A,

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.700
 then the other two are for B.

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.780
 And a couple of them will actually chain between them.

00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.740
 Like I think it's the sequencer one

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.820
 that if they're both set to the same thing,

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:02.260
 they can be combined.

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.860
 - So you're always rocking doubles no matter what.

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:05.740
 And hemispheres.

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:07.340
 - Except for, yeah, except for a couple of cases

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.740
 where you can actually be like,

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.220
 I want both of them to work and then they can,

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:12.380
 you can actually go between,

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:14.980
 like they'll actually just operate as one.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:15.820
 - Oh, okay.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.340
 - But everything else is completely,

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.620
 they're just completely independent, super smooth.

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.220
 A bunch of like really like bread and butter stuff,

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.060
 like not some bolts.

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:25.300
 And that's why I think there's like that

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:28.300
 disting element to it of like, you know,

00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:32.620
 you can use this for just a fucking AD envelope

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:33.780
 if you wanted to.

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.660
 But you can also do these like really interesting

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.140
 sort of like logic stuff.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:40.340
 There's these weird like latching like modes

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.460
 and there's a ton of them.

00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:46.140
 - So latching as in like, like setting a vault

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.300
 once it hits a threshold, it'll stay high

00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.060
 until it gets another reset.

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:53.260
 Yes, like really interesting little stuff like that.

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.100
 - Nice.

00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.820
 - And that's why like the warrior where analogy comes in

00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:00.300
 'cause it's just like, here's a cool little thing that works.

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.860
 And it's not super complicated,

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:03.860
 but if that's what you're looking for,

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:05.500
 it's super fucking useful.

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:08.820
 Nifty.

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.820
 I mean, that's that element, the ornaments of crime

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:12.740
 has always turned me off.

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.700
 So I haven't ever gotten one 'cause it looked like

00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:17.700
 it was too much menu and not enough interface.

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.540
 You know, just one knob, one button type of thing.

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:20.940
 And I was like, yeah.

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:23.140
 And a lot of the stuff in it never really appealed to me,

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:26.300
 but yeah, hemisphere, I'm intrigued.

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:27.660
 Dave, tell me more.

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:29.140
 What's your go to in there?

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:33.380
 - So right now I've been doing a, what's it called?

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.180
 The little, there's a little five step sequencer

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:38.180
 with that thing.

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.020
 - Five step.

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:41.660
 - Five step, but then if anything drops down to zero,

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:42.780
 it just gets skipped.

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:45.900
 So you can make it any amount that you want.

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.460
 - I do have five step sequins.

00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:48.300
 - Yeah.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:52.460
 And the other one is that weird little logic thing

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.100
 where I have it where basically I set like a threshold.

00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.940
 And then once that gets hit,

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.180
 then the output stays at that

00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.580
 and then you can reset that later.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:00.780
 - Yeah, I like that logic.

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:03.980
 I've used other stuff to rig that type of thing up.

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:04.820
 - Same here.

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.860
 And I was like, this is, I don't have to rig it up now.

00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:09.420
 I just have it with these a couple of inputs

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:11.420
 and then just become super useful.

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:12.260
 - Nifty.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:13.100
 - Yeah.

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.460
 And there's a bunch of them that I've like,

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:17.660
 I go, cool, that's there and haven't really used that much,

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.820
 but it's rather than it's there.

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:21.380
 And it's super fucking stable.

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:23.700
 Like I've had no problems with it.

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.820
 It was super easy to update, like to add to it.

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:32.620
 I don't know, like if I went back to the original firmware

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:35.260
 for it, I'd still get a ton of use out of it.

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.300
 I think it's a useful module,

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.060
 but this is like way more useful.

00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.100
 This appeals to my brain a lot better.

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.260
 - Nice.

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:46.140
 - This tracker in front of us is pretty cute.

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.380
 That's for sure.

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.940
 - It is, every time I see it,

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:50.140
 I've seen it a couple of times now

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:51.540
 and see pictures of it.

00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:54.260
 It is an amazing object.

00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.780
 It is just beautifully designed.

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:57.100
 It looks very nice.

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.340
 Like it's one of the things where I would be,

00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:00.980
 normally just put stickers on shit

00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.780
 and if it gets dinged up or whatever,

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:04.620
 it gets dinged up.

00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:07.220
 But I may even have a compulsion

00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:09.420
 to keep something like that nice.

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:11.380
 - I mean, that's pretty dirty at the moment.

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:12.740
 It's not that nice.

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:13.580
 - Well, not even mentioned.

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.420
 - It's a little filthy.

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.980
 - It looks nice, got proper felt though.

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:17.380
 It should be kind of filthy.

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.220
 - You know.

00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:22.380
 - I mean, aside from the lack of stereo sampling,

00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:25.540
 I don't have too many complaints about it,

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:28.900
 but I noticed online some people's honeymoon phase

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.140
 is ending with it.

00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.260
 Some people are complaining about the jog wheel

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.780
 messing up and things like that.

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:37.420
 Some people I think,

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:38.740
 I think there was a little bit of backlash

00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:43.740
 going on to the price of the skin diversions

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:47.540
 and like the price differences with those

00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:49.180
 and I don't know.

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.500
 It didn't really bother me.

00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:57.220
 I didn't really care about either the new skin versions.

00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.060
 My cousin, however, was pissed

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.900
 'cause he had just bought one and then those dropped

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.340
 and he was like pretty pissed

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.660
 'cause he said he wanted the banana one.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.900
 - I was gonna say it was the Bogdan banana one.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.260
 - I don't even think he's familiar with Bogdan,

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.540
 but he just really liked the banana skin.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.860
 He was like, I would have paid more for that.

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.940
 I'm like, you would have paid more.

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.940
 'Cause it's got a banana one.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:18.060
 I was like, do just buy some fucking banana stickers.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:18.900
 - Yeah.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.740
 - Or style flip it.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.580
 - Style flip it.

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:21.420
 - Yeah.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.260
 - It's probably what it is.

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.820
 - Well, that'd be amazing if it really was

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.340
 and it wasn't even applied.

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:28.860
 You had to, it just came with the style flipped sticker

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.140
 and you had to put it on yourself

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:32.060
 but it cost way more than it would cost

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.820
 for you to just get it on your own.

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.660
 - I don't know.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.700
 The look of it in its normal state,

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:38.820
 just plain black.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:39.660
 - Yeah, that was beautiful.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.900
 - Peel to me, so did the price.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:42.940
 So like having one that was all brightly colored

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.660
 and like, you know, different looking

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.500
 and more expensive didn't appeal to me in any way

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.220
 even with extra sample pack on there.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.060
 - Right.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:51.900
 - Like I don't give a shit.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.420
 I'm loading this thing with my own sounds.

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.100
 I don't need to pay a premium

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.740
 for other people's sounds that I'm never gonna touch.

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.140
 - It looks like Pre Lenovo IBM

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.900
 like made some weird side project music thing

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:03.740
 and there it is.

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.580
 - Yeah.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.620
 It looks like machine.

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.580
 Everything has like a precision on it that is a...

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:10.980
 - Buttons are the hotness.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:11.820
 - Yeah.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.100
 - I wish they had, these are much nicer

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.980
 than like the electron ones

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.060
 and I kind of wish the electron on so like that.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.140
 - Yeah, I love the fuel.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.980
 - Right, so the jog wheel's pretty big and circular.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:27.220
 So if you want, I can make you a sticker of my face

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.980
 to put on the jog wheel.

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:29.980
 - So you're solid, okay.

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.900
 Nice. - Nice.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:32.740
 - I like it.

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:33.580
 - Going around around the circle.

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:34.740
 - I like it. - Laring at you.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.140
 - Okay.

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.620
 In like four different ways, right?

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:41.220
 So no matter how I turn it, it's like right side up.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.060
 - Yes.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:43.380
 - No, it's yes.

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.180
 - Like could you make it a hologram too?

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.620
 - So you're like, "Oh yeah."

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.660
 - Now we're talking.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.140
 - Eating like a spax sandwich or something.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.260
 - Or like that lenticular art with the,

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:53.540
 where it would change.

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.020
 So it's like a two frame animation

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:56.740
 of like me biting into a sandwich.

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.860
 - That's sick, that would be awesome.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:58.940
 - Yeah.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.500
 - Okay, I'll try a premium for that.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.700
 Yeah, consider it done.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.220
 - I'll get a tracker just for that sticker.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.660
 I did have a tracker for a week,

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.020
 but it intimidated me.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:09.380
 Or rather, I didn't want to get into another system.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.620
 It was cool though.

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.860
 - I haven't had a system

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.180
 not intimidate me as much as this one.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.020
 You know what I mean?

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:19.860
 - No, yeah.

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.620
 - I find it fairly welcoming for me.

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.860
 I jive with it well.

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:27.100
 This, you know, I'm still digging it.

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:27.940
 You know what I mean?

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.460
 Even after a few months now,

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.460
 it's still like my go-to,

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.780
 trying to figure out how to put stuff on there

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.140
 to perform on things like that.

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.580
 Not just use it as a studio tool.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.660
 - So this is gonna be in your live setup?

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.220
 - Most likely, I don't think I'm gonna be

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.380
 basing my entire set off of it.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.620
 - I think that's gonna still be mostly based off of the

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:51.620
 teraz and some form of either a noise rig,

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:54.340
 you know what I mean?

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.420
 Modular or a couple small desktops

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.500
 that I can utilize with the teraz.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:02.500
 And this will just be like an accompanying piece of gear

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.700
 that I can bounce into some rhythms with,

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.380
 some patterns, but not based everything off of.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:11.340
 - No, it's a rising just 'cause I could see a scenario

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.980
 where someone, this was the hearts and brains of it.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.340
 Everything was based off of that.

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.940
 - Would you do like DJ mixer stuff set up

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.260
 and like fade over to it?

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.540
 Like, just figure that out.

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:25.020
 - That's still what I'm trying to figure out.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.460
 And you talking about that 505.

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.300
 - Oh yeah.

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.220
 - Has me thinking other things now too.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:33.580
 It was like, you know, if I could just loop chunks

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.340
 of the tracker and overlay with things going on with the

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.460
 teraz. - That was perfect.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.460
 - Yeah, I'd be having a blast with that, I think.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.040
 (upbeat music)

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.620
 (upbeat music)

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.200
 (upbeat music)

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.780
 (upbeat music)

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.360
 (upbeat music)

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.040
 (upbeat music)

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.720
 (upbeat music)

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.300
 (upbeat music)

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.880
 (upbeat music)

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.460
 (upbeat music)
