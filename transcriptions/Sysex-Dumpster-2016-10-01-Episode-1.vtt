00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.100
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.100
 Doesn't it say maybe start off with an op-con?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.640
 Well, that's fresh in our brain.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.640
 Good old knob con.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.080
 But I totally heard.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.000
 Jack off to the future.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.120
 Jacking house.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.480
 That was what the fifth knob con, I think total.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.840
 And the third for you and me in the second for you.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.560
 It was in a different hotel that did not like loud noises.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.960
 Yeah, that all was unfortunate.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.640
 But do you get the impression I just

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.920
 didn't know what they were getting into?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.320
 The hotel just was just not prepared for--

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.640
 Since we missed out on the first two, I don't know.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.760
 But I heard from someone else that that was the original location.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.280
 Oh.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.600
 So I would think they knew what they were getting into.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.120
 But maybe not.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.600
 I don't know.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.440
 Because the music got cut off.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.760
 And the one new thing that I really

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.920
 liked about it, which was the bug out room,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.240
 got completely shut down throughout half of the day

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.240
 on Saturday.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.740
 Yeah.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.080
 Which was unfortunate and wasn't open at all at night.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.400
 Which I guess if anyone who wasn't there,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.080
 it doesn't know what the bug out room was.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.000
 It was where anyone could bring in their gear and set up

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.560
 and just jam at any point throughout the day.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.880
 But the hotel staff shut her down.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.840
 I wonder if the hotel got a little confused,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.360
 because they may have been presented as like,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.560
 oh, there's going to be a lot of manufacturers.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.080
 Maybe they thought it was going to be drier than that,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.440
 the sort of--

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.000
 Just you know, of comforted and like talks in here all day.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.640
 So it'd be a real estate.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.520
 Yeah.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.400
 Which we should have just skipped.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.840
 Knock on and just gone straight to the flipper.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.400
 How's that?

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400
 Probably going to--

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 Maybe it's in the term right?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.600
 Probably a better fiscal decision.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.960
 Really spending hundreds of dollars on modules.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.440
 That's fair enough.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.440
 Yeah.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.960
 Although--

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.640
 But probably not.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.160
 Probably not.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.160
 Probably not.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.240
 I wonder if I was randomly saying shit.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.960
 Those people were probably crying.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.320
 Crying and dumpsters right now for everybody that attended.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.080
 Trying to follow his advice and just--

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.360
 None of this is working.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.080
 I don't think this was real.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.160
 There was a financial services like flipping houses,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.200
 conferences, and now contue.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.240
 Next to knock on.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.240
 Yeah.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.040
 No, it's be fair.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.000
 It was not part of the law.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.480
 Yeah.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.880
 Although they seemed intrigued--

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.400
 That really?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.760
 By the room of noise next to them.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.440
 They were trying to give a conference.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.280
 We were saying too that there should be a way to swap modules

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.040
 or a list.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.000
 Why don't we talk about that?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.320
 Yeah.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.600
 I don't remember that.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.840
 Even just the idea of just having an area of--

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.120
 especially using something like Muffster or Facebook

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.600
 or some other technology to just be like, I'm here.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.280
 This is stuff I have.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.000
 Come meet me here.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.840
 I'm interested in trades.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.280
 I'm interested in this.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.880
 I think they would have gone over really well.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.520
 Because it did seem like there was a ton of people

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.280
 with their setups, brought their stuff out,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.680
 and even just got no great, was swapping things out.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.880
 At the con, really take advantage of everyone

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.880
 just being fired up for like, I want this, I want this.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.440
 Oh, but I need this other module.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.080
 And someone else is sitting in a hotel room, three doors down,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.120
 wanting to get rid of that exact module.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.760
 It's just an missed opportunity.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.840
 Yeah, the year before I met a couple people up for some sales

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.160
 that I made on the Muffboard, and they were like,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.200
 are you going to Nubcon?

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.800
 I'm like, yeah.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.880
 So they were like, well, I'll save you on shipping.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.360
 I'll just meet you there.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.280
 And that worked out cool.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.280
 And yeah, it would definitely make

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.640
 sense to have an area for people trading or selling.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.040
 Just for that purpose.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.120
 Anything like a swap meet type of--

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.080
 Mm-hmm.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.960
 Makes sense in the future, for sure.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.720
 Outside the one room being totally off on its own

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.000
 and kind of difficult to get to, purely

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.200
 because I'm lazy and I don't want to walk,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.280
 it seemed like everything was laid out somewhat sensibly.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.320
 Like, there's a ton of stuff.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.680
 And it seems like it's getting bigger, way bigger

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.560
 than it was last year.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.200
 I can't really gauge if it was bigger,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.520
 but it definitely felt more spaced out.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.760
 It was definitely less claustrophobic.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.960
 You didn't have to elbow through people

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.480
 to get to a table to check out what you wanted to check out.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.600
 Last year, it definitely felt cramped in the main room.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.040
 Because there was the one main room,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.960
 and then there was the quiet room, which not too many people

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.880
 utilized last year this year.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.320
 There was definitely more of that.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.080
 Yeah, but I totally agree that the idea of something

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.480
 that's going later, even if you could

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.440
 turn it down a little bit, I still

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.200
 think it would have been-- there's a lot of people

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.680
 that obviously wanted to hang out longer than that.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.280
 You could make the argument, like, oh, just stay in your room

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.960
 and use headphones and be quiet until whenever you want.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.640
 But if they're going to have that conference room,

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.240
 like, they should let people sit there until whenever.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.840
 It's not like-- it was the rowtiest crowd.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.840
 No, no.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.000
 And it's not like we needed full--

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.640
 a lot of attention.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.920
 Just leave the power on.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.040
 We don't even light.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040
 There weren't even lights on.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.880
 The ones out there.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.440
 There were some polite motherfuckers.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.520
 Yeah, the year before, they went--

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.920
 that was at least until 1 AM.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.560
 I felt like in the main performance room,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.840
 and no complaints.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.360
 Yeah.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.360
 And it shut down.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.080
 No signs in the hallway.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.520
 Yeah.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.960
 Telling you to not make noise like it's a library.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.000
 But yeah.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.840
 That was as far as stuff you saw.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.400
 I feel like there was a lot of great stuff

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.440
 to actually check out.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.800
 And it was on display there.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.880
 And this was the first time, a lot of time,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.960
 for a lot of stuff, being able to get our filthy paws on it.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.640
 Carbon.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.240
 That is as far as making notes for this.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.440
 That was the first thing.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.960
 The first thing.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.160
 Carbon.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.000
 That blew my mind.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.200
 Yeah.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.400
 It basically hits everything that I was looking for out

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.760
 of engine with CV out of the gate,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.240
 not having to be an add-on.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.040
 And just the weirdly pleasant Kilpatrick style

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.880
 of grid display.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.120
 And looking into it the second time

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.360
 I went back and was screwing around with it.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.680
 And the guy was like, just giving me a little help.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.760
 Check this out.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.840
 Everything's just one or two buttons away.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.680
 It's not divey at all.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.200
 Which I was a little worried about,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.000
 because there was a tiny little things at the bottom.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.520
 It was just like, no, those are just letting you know

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.440
 what's going on in the other seats.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.240
 Yeah, which is nice.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.600
 Yeah, it was like, this is really well thought out.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.160
 And it looks like an Atari Lynx?

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.640
 Yes.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.640
 But not really.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.240
 Because you know, now I'm pissed that it doesn't.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.480
 That would be--

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.800
 Why aren't you an Atari Lynx?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.960
 Our Trevor Graphics Express.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.840
 Either or?

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.840
 Shit.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.520
 Now that I yanked the guts out of a carbon

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.080
 and put it into one of those.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.200
 It's been brewing it.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.120
 Ask for support.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.520
 This is quite my warranty.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.480
 Yeah, I didn't get to have too much hands on time with it.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.080
 I just had the overview that the guy was doing.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.960
 But it seemed like the best of the two sequencer

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.080
 modules from Kilpatrick that I have had hands on experience

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.560
 with.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.440
 It had some elements of the pattern generator, which

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.000
 was one of my favorites.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.840
 And they're just Kilpatrick sequencer.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.480
 Some of the generative functions of that

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.040
 seemed to be in the carbon, which was real nice.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.960
 It's like a nice gel of the two together.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.320
 The USB host is brilliant.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.320
 Yeah.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.960
 That's awesome.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.320
 And the overview on the screen of everything is pretty nice.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.080
 That's a nice touch.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.360
 We'll be the next one though.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.840
 We varigate.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.320
 Yeah?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.760
 Yeah.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.640
 I also, I mean, sort of taking a step outside of the module

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.680
 there, that dude's presentation.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.960
 That was amazing.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.880
 It was a super in-depth, super--

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.520
 it was not the broshoe level.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.880
 And I think that also helped with, hey, there's

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.640
 a lot going on in this module.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.000
 And I walked up to him and I'm like, oh, that's cool.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.680
 It's a gate sequencer.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.920
 I wasn't super excited.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.360
 I left fired up for it.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.360
 Yeah.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.480
 That was Ben Davis, the guy responsible for making it.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.440
 So it was cool to see him explain his own creation there.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.280
 It felt like a lot of people in the Avcon just

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.520
 had a representative there as opposed

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.800
 to the person behind it.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.160
 So it was cool to see him pointing out what he felt

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.160
 was the strong points and give a passionate presentation

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.320
 of everything it was capable of.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.240
 Yeah, it would definitely--

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.640
 it's on my to buy list for sure.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.040
 I really enjoyed the varigate for this really

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.320
 expands on it.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.120
 I mean, it's not only just more tracks,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.080
 but just more functionality overall.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.440
 You get four additional 16-step tracks now

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.000
 of probabilistic gates, plus two CV tracks

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.480
 that you can assign to any of those tracks

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.440
 or have free floating, I believe.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.880
 If you don't want it hard-paired with a gate track,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.080
 it can just be its own thing.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.080
 So it's got all the randomized functions saving.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.840
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.840
 It's hard to think of anything bad about it.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.400
 It's just for the cost and for the size.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.000
 There's nothing like it, really.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.840
 Especially if you're not having the screen of any type,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.360
 really.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.240
 You can't do too much more without having some reference

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.040
 point like that.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.480
 So it seems like a nice mix.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.600
 Even without a screen, too, it doesn't seem at all like

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.440
 menu diving.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.440
 There's a couple combos you've got to do.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.800
 Whole two things at once, but everything's

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.240
 laid out on the module panel itself,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.600
 saying what slider does what when you're holding it.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.720
 Like, I kind of missed my Turing machine,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.800
 and I think that would make me a lot less sad about it.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.040
 Yeah, definitely.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.400
 That is definitely the one thing, probably the top

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.840
 of my list of the thing I regret getting rid of.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.680
 I didn't realize just how much I was using it.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.120
 And now, the varicade actually would be a pretty--

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.240
 actually, I mean, it would be an amazing replacement for me.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.120
 Yeah, totally, especially with the quantization

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.600
 on board and everything.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.040
 It's pretty dope.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.240
 How many times am I going to say dope?

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.920
 Is there an ETA for the varicade?

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.480
 Is it like--

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.040
 I think--

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.240
 --soon this week?

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.160
 Oh, that's real soon.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.640
 Yeah, I was talking to Ben on Facebook.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:11:00.320
 He said he, I think, just got his production version of it.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.800
 And the first batch is going out from Dark Place,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.840
 I think, this week.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.920
 Oh, wow.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.720
 For our listeners, what does it actually say at state

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.800
 as we reference it next week?

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.320
 October 1st.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:11.720
 There we go.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.560
 Hey.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.400
 On the ball, they're correct.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.320
 I can easily do it.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.920
 The first day of the month.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.800
 I do it.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.560
 Wake up.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.000
 Yeah.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.760
 That's even--

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.080
 Yeah.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.360
 Both hugs immediately.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.120
 Didn't take long.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:30.320
 Yeah, there seems to be a lot of stuff dropping right now.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:30.800
 Yeah.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.480
 Like early October.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.160
 Just got the new engine, OS.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.920
 Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.640
 But it just loaded it on before I came over here, which

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.600
 is like ratcheting per step now, like repeats per step,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.320
 and like probability sequences and other fixes

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.400
 to make it a lot easier to use.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.520
 Don't have to delete every pattern manually now

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.400
 if you want to clear stuff.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.120
 So yeah, and it fixes the TV bug thing that I ran into.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.480
 So I got to check that out.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.280
 How easy is it to update?

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.200
 Is it--

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.920
 Yeah, it's USB cable.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.680
 And like the-- it just uses the teensy app.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.960
 So you just load the hex file.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.480
 And once it connects, it just uploads it.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.040
 Is that a keeper for you?

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040
 I don't know.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.440
 Like, they'll be straight up.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.400
 Like, it's really good.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.600
 And I like where he's going with it.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.120
 I don't know.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.360
 I remember it's kind of on defense,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:20.720
 but more--

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.400
 Yeah.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.720
 I thought the carbon was like--

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.240
 Yeah.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.360
 I thought the carbon was going to get me there for a second.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.760
 And I did almost get a used one when I was like,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.960
 I kind of--

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.360
 I don't want to learn anything new right now.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.120
 You know, that's not a good reason, but I just don't want to.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.840
 Do you have the CV expansion for the engine?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.280
 Yeah.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:38.720
 OK.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.480
 Yeah, that's-- I found that bug in it.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.120
 So that's supposedly fixed now.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.680
 Even though I deleted that pattern,

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.080
 and like, I don't-- I can't even recreate it anymore.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.880
 So you're not able to actually test.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.560
 I guess I could.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.440
 It was like the lowest note possible

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.960
 that was out of the range of like below a C0.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.480
 Because you can do that with the transpose.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.440
 Do like a C0, but then transpose it down.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.720
 I think you can do that.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.160
 And then like, crashed it.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.680
 Because it did not handle that range.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.720
 Does it just drop it to C0 or does it actually go--

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.040
 I think now I would probably just--

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.160
 I would hope it would just drop it to C0 or something.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.000
 But yeah, it's awesome.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.720
 But I don't know.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.360
 I'm fickle with sequencers.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.920
 And the MIDI box is kind of just ruling that whole area

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.320
 from here right now.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.760
 But it has like eight CV gate pairs.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.480
 So that's kind of hard to be mad at too.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.000
 Because the MIDI box, I have to go through my Kilpatrick MIDI

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.520
 converter, which is sweet, but not eight.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.680
 MIDI to Cv-- eight pairs of MIDI CV gate.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.560
 Also the MIDI box is enormous.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.640
 That is definitely for home.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.640
 Yeah.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.240
 If I would do like a techno live thing,

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.240
 I would probably bring it out.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.240
 Because I do all the work like in there.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.600
 But the sequence isn't that.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.440
 But yeah, I don't--

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.960
 it scares me to bring it out too.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.480
 It's definitely very DIY.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.800
 But it's robust.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.480
 Like it will.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.440
 It'll hold up to it.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.280
 But I don't know.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.680
 It's like DIY, you know?

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.480
 Which is kind of why I have the engine too, just like as a backup.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.640
 But that's really paranoid.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.560
 But I just want to be able to work if it fucks up, which

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.240
 did happen with one release.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.920
 But then the next release, you fixed everything that

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.760
 was like corrupting my files.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.640
 So I don't know.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:19.080
 I saw the-- so for our listeners, Nick is playing.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.600
 Is it Wednesday?

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.760
 Wednesday's Wednesday at the Pittsburgh modular thing.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.680
 The fifth.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.280
 The fifth.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:26.800
 Yeah.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.200
 I mean, actually enough to see me do a yell by then.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.280
 But if it is--

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.840
 If it is, someone should check it out.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.800
 Jump through the internet and go to Pittsburgh.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.320
 Exactly.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.040
 And if you're-- oh, also our listeners,

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.520
 this is being recorded in Pittsburgh, which we haven't

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.840
 established anything.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.160
 Like there's no baseline to that later.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.240
 For what we're doing here we are, where we're at, time and place.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.960
 We don't really know ourselves.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.360
 No, I didn't know what day it was.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.480
 It's like a flash mob podcast.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.800
 Surprised for podcasting.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.360
 But I noticed that the engine wasn't on your setup.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.320
 No.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.120
 But I thought it was going to be at first.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.040
 And then I didn't want to bring a terrible amount of things.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.920
 And honestly, I've never used it live.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.240
 And I've never used it with the lights off.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.400
 But there's a lot of shit on there.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.360
 There's very menu-divey.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.160
 You have to know what you're doing, kind of.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.360
 And the Octatrack, the MIDI stuff that I'm doing to sequence

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.840
 the modular like that I could be pretty drunk and still use that.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.640
 Not that I'm going to be drunk at the show, but I know how to use it.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.120
 But you will be drunk at the show.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.120
 Probably.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:32.800
 No.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.360
 I hope not.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:33.680
 I will.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.680
 Yes, I will be.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.640
 And I decided to, unlike previous sets, that I would come up with a setup.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.200
 And then I would stop fucking with that setup, because I only had a week to do something to.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.720
 So I wanted to change it really badly this morning.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.200
 And I didn't buy myself.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.320
 It's a bad habit.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.080
 It's a terrible habit.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.080
 It's terrible.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.440
 Don't do what I do.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.600
 We'll do it live.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.600
 Yeah.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.960
 This will be live.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.880
 I'm trying to set up kits on things that I can play.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.360
 I have a little bit of fallback, but I really kind of want to just, oh, I'm actually going

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.640
 to play this stuff and not really try to play some shit that I made with it.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.640
 You mean on the Octa?

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.040
 Yeah, on the Octa of the rhythm and the modular.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.240
 The modular all kind of switched sequences and then like braids, patches, and then the

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.360
 by similar to Teratuss, Alter, will be like doing drum stuff simultaneously going into

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.880
 the Octa track and I'll just kind of play with that.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.320
 And that seems to be working out so far in practice.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.720
 Like this is all based on what the practices have been like.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.600
 Speaking of the drum module, which again was something you fucking amazing.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.440
 Yeah, another knob con sort of discovery.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:50.800
 So, like drum synth in a module with envelopes, crazy variations.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:56.600
 Sequencing the modes now is like ridiculous from a sound design and like making a track

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.600
 perspective like fucking amazing.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.240
 Yeah, because I think you kind of get like a drum module and you know right away, like

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.040
 you're going to, you see the expiration date for that module and you get it.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.880
 You're like, yeah, I'm going to use this, but it, it's either going to hit forever or

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.520
 it's going to get really annoying at some point.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.520
 I'm going to sell it.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.080
 But that thing I doubt, I doubt I'll run out of steam with that.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.240
 It just seems, especially everything has CV input.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:26.680
 So it's like fucking, yeah, it's like, yeah, you can get endless just triggering the thing.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.680
 But then you start to throw CV at everything.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.680
 Right.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.520
 It's like endless, endless sweet spots.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.520
 Yeah.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.920
 Which is not common for most drum modules.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.360
 Most of them you find like your one spot, maybe a couple more and you think you're so

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.400
 okay, I could probably just sample this and be done with it.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:51.760
 This thing, it definitely begs to be like used with control voltages in real time.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.760
 Yeah.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.760
 Yeah.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.040
 It's totally, I think really well thought out.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:02.320
 Like I own the original for a while and it had its moments, you know, but like this just

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.800
 takes it to a whole other level.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:11.160
 Being able to see the modes and the range and the fact that he added, you know, a new

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160
 mode in there.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.120
 I can't remember off him what that is.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.840
 Oh, the liquid skin, right?

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.400
 Like what's the new one?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.080
 And also the Alto mode, which is great for like the kick range.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:30.760
 So you can do bass kick and then like all out high end screechiness with this thing.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.760
 Yes.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.760
 And then you can do a little bit of a bass machine for sure.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.760
 Yeah.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.680
 Can you get like other type of precautions?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.680
 Can you make a nice snare?

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680
 Can you make a nice call?

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.680
 Absolutely.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.680
 Like is it?

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.000
 So actually just having a rack of five or six blows would be.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.680
 Because the thing like if you don't, when you get it, if you don't turn up the decay,

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.080
 you'll think like, why is that fucking noise playing all the time?

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.160
 Because it's that noise is blended in there unless you turn the attack up, sorry, the

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.160
 attack.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.960
 And then it kind of goes away and you just hear the oscillator sound.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.280
 But if you turn that attack down and it's layering, that noise on top of it, that's also kind

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.280
 of tracking the pitch.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.480
 I think that's how it's working.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.480
 Yeah.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:12.640
 Going clockwise from zero to 12, you're doing a type of noise blend on the attack knob

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.120
 and then everything after 12.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.120
 Exactly.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.240
 It's like real attack on the oscillators.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:25.200
 And the, even the morph is just thought out well.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.280
 Like it'll take you from sign through all the other wave shapes and then if you go all

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.840
 the way clockwise, you're back to sign.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.280
 So if you're hitting that with CV, you get smooth blending all the way through.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.440
 It's pretty well, well thought out.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.440
 Yeah.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.440
 Yeah.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.440
 Yeah.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.800
 Cause even in, I think in the different modes, it changes what it morphs through like which

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.360
 waveforms cause the spread, I think kind of moves it like it's one to six oscillators.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.520
 And he kind of, it's all modal.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.600
 So like a bunch of different things change when you change like morph depending upon

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.600
 the mode.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.080
 Like it's all kind of tweaked and tuned.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.440
 I kind of like, I hope more people go in that way where it's like modal stuff that kind

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.240
 of does a lot of things behind the scenes cause a lot of the analog stuff is kind of

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.240
 done.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.640
 This is the shit you want out of a digital model.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.640
 Exactly.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.640
 Yeah.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.520
 Like if you're going to bother to go that route, go this route.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520
 No.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.520
 Yeah.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.080
 I don't really want a digital mode filter emulation.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.080
 Exactly.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.960
 Interesting in any way to me.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.960
 Yeah.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.120
 He does a great job with the manual too.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.120
 Like yeah.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:32.080
 Very well written goes, you know, talks about the inspiration behind it and all that.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.760
 Which it's cool to get, you know, the manufacturers take on what the hell's going on behind it.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.000
 Same with the, the, the low kerik or low kelok.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 Yeah.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Yeah.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.960
 We all ended up coming out of there with a noise engineering model.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.960
 Yeah.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.720
 One of the, the alters and you got the, however the hell you pronounce it.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.720
 It's a classic something.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.720
 Yeah.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720
 I forget that.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720
 But the manual for that is a, it's astounding.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:59.880
 I mean it has like the actual like math, but it was the signals and the calculus for each

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.880
 of the different modes.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.880
 Oh, well.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:07.640
 I mean, and yeah, they also included references to the research papers that they were looking

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.280
 at the white papers or the books they were reading.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.280
 I was like, this is, I don't know.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.280
 Yeah.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.120
 I have so far been nothing but impressive noise engineering.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.120
 Yeah.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.120
 I agreed.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.760
 I didn't know what the hell he was talking about there.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.760
 I appreciated that.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.760
 I was in there.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.760
 I was like, okay.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.800
 Now, and he, he's even gone in interviews saying like, you know, he was really inspired

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.840
 by all tech or early industrial and things like that.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.400
 And I think it really shows in the stuff that he's putting out right now.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.760
 It's most of it is digital and it's, it's the good side of digital, you know.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.760
 Totally agree.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.760
 Yeah.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.080
 There's one, that like one surgeon record that came out.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.400
 There's a track that starts with A. So every time I plug my iPod in or phone in the car

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.160
 and iPod into the car, like plays the first alphabetical track, no matter what, because

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.880
 fucking Apple, right?

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.200
 And it's always like this kick drum sound that I know now after I got that module, I'm

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.760
 like, oh yeah, that's the fucking best stimulus.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.480
 Like no question that kick drum was made from that thing.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.880
 Like the way it aliases and the way he shifts the alias frequencies depending upon the mode

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.760
 stuff to like, so you can hear it.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.400
 So it's not just always in the high range, like alias saying that was fucking brilliant.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:21.000
 Yeah, my first run with it when I own the version one, not the altar, I mainly got it

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.640
 for that type of like metallic, you know, percussion, FM wave folding, nastiness.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.480
 And I got, it did that well, but I kind of got bored with it and I ended up selling

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.480
 it.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:37.680
 And like this version can do that and, you know, be a great kick or be great synth all

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.680
 in one.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.480
 So I think it really took it to the next level and makes me want to own more than one

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.480
 at some point.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:51.800
 Yeah, so he's got like another one in the works like another modal digital type thing

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.960
 that like I guess he just moved his facility or whatever to some other place.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.000
 He's got a lot of logic based things going on.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.600
 Two modules I think were inspired by Aaron of Venetian snares.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:14.600
 With I think gate modules, gate generators, logic, rhythmic generators, I guess you could

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.760
 call them, didn't get a chance to play with any of those at NOPCON.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.160
 But it's the type of thing that I would really like to get some hands on, you know, just

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.320
 to wrap my head on what they actually do first.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.760
 You need one after Derek too.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.560
 Yeah, that's the manual one.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.680
 Yeah, punch everything in finger triggered gates.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.440
 They weren't actually at NOPCON, right?

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.920
 I mean, there were just a couple of people that had the modules, but there was no presence.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.400
 Right, which was unfortunate.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.120
 I would love to play with a whole rack of noise engineering stuff.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.680
 Oh, I would actually interview.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.600
 Yeah, also I just want to get drunk.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.920
 Just hang out and just that seems like a really good time.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.920
 Talk about IDM and industrial.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.920
 So what's next?

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.920
 What's next in the queue?

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.720
 I do want to talk about NOPCON things.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.600
 Yeah, I think there's a lot we could...

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.600
 I think so.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600
 Look on.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.520
 We barely really touched a scratch of surface on.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.520
 Oh, I'm going on.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.520
 Yeah, NOPCON.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.520
 NOPCON.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.520
 Oh, I mean, I guess the other thing to do is like, what's...

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.040
 We're talking about some of the highlights.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.960
 It's only fair to talk about some of the negatives.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:22.280
 Yeah, what was something that maybe was disappointing or surprising?

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:31.320
 I don't want to hate too much, but it would be cool to see musical acts that were more

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.000
 like working a modular type thing.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 I didn't get to see that as much.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.040
 Did you talk about the Saturday night?

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.040
 Yeah, sorry.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.320
 The Saturday night acts.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.080
 I did not see Friday night acts.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.080
 Full disclosure.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.080
 Yeah, full disclosure.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.840
 None of us went to the banquet.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.840
 Was that what it is?

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.160
 No, we're not banquet attendees.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.720
 I don't think they have a vegetarian dish.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.720
 That's my...

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.720
 That's my...

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720
 That's my...

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.080
 Yeah, surface excuse, but I don't like to go to things like that.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.960
 It's kind of pricey, especially if there's nothing on the menu for you.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.600
 In my opinion, but...

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.840
 Ooh, that one's good.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.840
 Do you want to burn it over?

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.840
 I've got this one.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.840
 It's great.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.840
 It's fantastic for a love.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.600
 Yeah, I think there was one of my top complaints though.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.600
 If you had no sprot.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.600
 Of course, it's not sprot.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.600
 That's sprot too?

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.600
 Like beer?

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.600
 I think so.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.600
 Is it good?

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.600
 I'm really interrupting you just so I can ask Nick if he had a beer.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.600
 I don't think I had that beer.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.600
 It's...

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.600
 You should try it out.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.600
 It's really good.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.600
 Okay, Greg, what were you saying?

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.840
 I was going to say the banquet...

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.080
 The third time I'd been there and the third time I'd opted out of the banquet just because

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:43.080
 it's expensive and there's only one special guest that while I have respect for was not

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:49.440
 really feeling spending like $50 to hear or speak.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.360
 That ties in with my other complaints.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:26:04.680
 There's a lot of focus there on Moog and I guess if you want to call it East Coast synthesis.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:14.540
 I would like to see just as much focus on more experimental speakers and just maybe

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.540
 live acts.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:21.160
 It doesn't have to be performances but anything that is related to things on the other's

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.440
 side of the scale.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.360
 Like one of the guests I would have loved to have seen would have been what's his name?

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.400
 Nick Gordon, the guy who just did the Dune soundtrack.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.400
 Oh yeah.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.400
 Oh yeah.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.400
 He's going crazy.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:45.280
 He's been posting videos on YouTube that are not necessarily music videos or anything

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.960
 to the soundtrack of Dune but just him going crazy in the studio.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.920
 Lots of modular gear, lots of even vintage gear.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.760
 He has a poly box in there.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.080
 Shit ton of pedals.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.000
 Everything that has a tube in it, whether it's a pedal or a module he seems to have.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.560
 It would have been really cool to hear someone like that just speak about their creative

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.560
 process.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.560
 It's a very mixed crowd there.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:15.600
 There's a lot of people there who are obviously old school and there's a lot of people there

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.440
 who were showing up wearing skinny puppy shirts and shit like that.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.440
 Skinny Pablo.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.440
 Skinny Pablo.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.000
 It's like a too dark taco.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.080
 So you got a, I think, knob con is finding itself in a unique position now because there's

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.040
 nothing else like it that is that accessible.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.240
 It's in the middle of the country.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.000
 A lot of people are coming from all over, like ourselves.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 We drove eight hours to get there.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.200
 It's not industry centric.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.200
 It's not.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.200
 It is not NAM.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.560
 Props to it for that.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.680
 Although it did seem a little heavier with that this time.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.880
 It was more manufacturer friendly, which is cool.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:03.880
 But without sacrificing something, we could still go get a ton out of it.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.320
 It seemed like it was a cool wide spectrum.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.320
 Exactly.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:15.240
 I feel like the crowd is a wide spectrum, but the event itself isn't catering to that.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.120
 I feel like it can be now.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:23.560
 It's gotten to the size and scale that it can definitely do both.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:29.240
 Mix old school with new school presentations and performances.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.600
 I don't think anyone's going to feel slighted if they do.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.800
 There's enough people there from both sides of the spectrum.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800
 Yeah.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.960
 I think too, that plays to go later, do things until two in the morning.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.960
 Sure.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.560
 Because again, there's people coming from all over.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.440
 You're in the middle of an industrial park.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.000
 It hits an nine o'clock.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.240
 What are you going to do?

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.240
 Right.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.360
 You just have a bunch of drunken nerds stuck in a hotel bar.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.720
 You've got to have something to do.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.320
 We used to feel like I'm in the suburbs again.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.320
 I'm like, I'm going to do something bad.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.000
 I just want to start breaking shit.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.720
 Let's go through rocks at cars or something.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.720
 Props to a modular, bad end.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.640
 For having that DIY set up where you could buy stuff.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.520
 Kids being able to be purchased that is good.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.280
 It's in the cube.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:20.000
 It's quite the tease to buy a new gear and then not be able to play with it until you get

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.600
 home and three days later.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:27.240
 You have a room where people can just go and jam out with their new toys or whatever

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.720
 set up they brought.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.280
 I think that was a good concept.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.600
 It just wasn't executed well enough.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600
 Yeah.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.600
 Great.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.200
 Speaking of the DIY room and the builder set up they had.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.200
 That was awesome.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.200
 Yeah.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.440
 I built the DPLPG dual pass-of-low pass gate.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.440
 That was awesome.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:54.080
 Cool thing was seeing some dad like teach his seven-year-old daughter to go, "Oh, solder

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.080
 a module."

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.080
 That's awesome.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.080
 That's pretty sweet.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.760
 But yeah, more of that, the DIY thing was totally cool.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:05.000
 I just ended up talking to a bunch of people while I was making the module.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 They fucked up your kit.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.160
 So, we couldn't get there, but they were totally cool about it too.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.800
 That module had a dude who props to him.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.400
 His refund to me, the note for it just said, "I'm a dick."

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.400
 That was nice.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.560
 Well, he oversold it, right?

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.560
 Yeah.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.520
 The DIY room was so popular that they actually oversold their kits.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.040
 And we were like half hour, 40 minutes late.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.800
 I mean, it was a good way to know we totally were.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.800
 I just didn't think we were coming.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.760
 Yeah, especially the DIY thing, it's like a crazy, sweet spot that many people don't

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.000
 know now, especially now, with even five years ago, there weren't as many.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.040
 There were a fraction of the amount of kits you could get for everything.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.040
 Yeah.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.000
 And even the kit that threw whole clouds, I was laughing, "I go that THC module, ha ha ha."

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.240
 Well, it's like threw whole clouds module that's half the cost, and that's fucking awesome.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.280
 And also, they are making kits, full kits, so you don't have to necessarily source them

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.280
 like you used to.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.280
 Yeah.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:02.240
 A lot of it seemed geared to introductory, not only DIY, but modular in general.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.560
 And there were people there who didn't even have a module.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:12.680
 The one guy I was talking to was outside of the room, he just stumbled upon knob con

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.680
 in an advertisement.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:19.240
 It's not something that he was planning to come to, and he read that they had DIY stuff,

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.360
 and he hadn't picked up a soldering iron in a decade, and he said, "Fuck it," and he

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.360
 soldered some shit.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.080
 It was like, "That's pretty cool."

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.080
 That's amazing.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.080
 Yeah.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.080
 Yeah.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.080
 Because it's not that hard at the end of the day.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.240
 If you can build a piece of Ikea furniture, you can solder something, too.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.960
 It's not that hard.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.080
 No, but it has a reputation of being.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:42.320
 It was very difficult, and it was very like an error-prone thing.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.320
 And no.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.960
 Yeah, I find it completely relaxing now, except when I fuck up.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.960
 But, okay, so we've touched on some of the stuff we didn't like about knob con overall.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.600
 We've talked about the DIY room.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.960
 Let's talk about some of the reveals, I guess, that we encountered there, because we haven't

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.960
 touched upon that.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.960
 There was a lot.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.360
 And there were some big name ones.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:12.560
 For me, the two big ones was the Matrix Brute and the 909.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:18.040
 Those were the two big things that I was like, "What wasn't just the 909?"

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.040
 The vocoder, VP03.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.040
 Yeah, they had the vocoder.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.040
 Yeah, the VP.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.040
 The 303 and the 909.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.040
 That's all it wants.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.040
 But it's a gabber enthusiast.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.040
 The 909.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.040
 That was the most important thing.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.040
 I don't know.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.800
 Just one time.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.480
 The gabber kick.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.480
 Original.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.000
 The Matrix Brute.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.560
 I was glad that we were there early to get a quiet one-on-one or one-on-three.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.720
 Some brilliant things about it a lot.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.720
 It was Matrix.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.720
 Very smart.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 I think it was a great thing.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.440
 fucking amazing. Oh really? Yeah. And so far, you're here and some change in on the road to, let me

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:25.600
 check them out. No it's huge. It'll never leave that rack, right? That's on my room. But in any

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:31.760
 case, I mean, it sounded fine. I wasn't blown away, but I wasn't disappointed either. Yeah, I think

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:37.840
 the matrix group kind of, as far as big since ago, yeah, stole the show. Yeah, definitely. It was

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:43.760
 located directly across from it. So that had my attention more. One theme from this year's

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:49.680
 knob con two was like tiny little screens. Yeah, it's definitely your rack tiny little screens.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:56.080
 Yeah, more of that. I feel like technology has finally reached a point where it's, you know,

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:02.320
 feasible. Yeah, tiny little screens. Tensey being ridiculously powerful, the new like super

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:07.760
 cheap arm processors. That seems like it's going to keep innovation going and making things cheaper.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:13.920
 Yeah, it's awesome. Cheap arm also. I mean, cool. You got X and Y then a couple of months,

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:19.840
 Z is going to come out and to have this, have this thing that, and you're not, you're not starting

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:23.840
 from scratch. You're not getting something new. You're not, you know, you can take advantage of

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:28.480
 all of the things you've learned. You spent all the time with a piece of gear and someone's adding

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:35.040
 new shit to it. You can now take advantage of that. And you're like, you're moving in lockstep

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.960
 with someone else who's making the platform more interesting. Yeah, like Neutron Sound Oregon.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.120
 That's perfect example. Yes. We could do a poll episode on that module, which is still

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:48.880
 fine. New things on like two nights ago. I was like, damn it. Things amazing. And even Neutron's

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.760
 a good example too, because the latest version, I tried it out and I didn't like it and I went back

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.280
 and I'm like, okay, cool. That's not, that's not where I want to go. I still have that choice.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.840
 I can be like, this is, this is, this is the spot that I think is that you nailed it.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.280
 See, I used to be, now I'm all in the latest version. I'm like, oh, I get it now and I'd like to,

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.920
 like, but yeah, it was the same way. It's nice that you can just pull on that, you know,

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.280
 pull on the Git repo. Yeah. It's, I mean, new capabilities for a module.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.680
 Exactly. It's a GitHub. There's a GitHub that's, I'll reap, I'll reap before it. That's,

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:25.120
 I'm a huge fan of that. I'm the same here. Like all my mutable stuff, pretty much. I'm running the

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:30.080
 alternative firmware is on. Oh, you got the parasite? Yeah. For braids. Yeah. I think there's an

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:35.360
 alternative for braids, right? Yes. I'm not right. I tried it, wasn't too into it.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:40.160
 Went back to the factory. What didn't you like about it? It was a minute ago. I think it's just

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:48.560
 because I use braids so much that I kind of know everything secondhand and loading on some firmware

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.840
 that switched that up, even if it added some functionality was throwing me off my game and

00:43:53.840 --> 00:44:01.040
 I just don't feel like adapting to it. Yeah. I feel like braids as it is factory, it's pretty solid.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:09.200
 Yeah. You know, like just, it's, I utilize every mode within that thing. You know, I mean, all the,

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:16.640
 you can get it low-fi, the drift mode, the, what is the macro mode, you know, all that shit. Like,

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:22.000
 I can just, I can navigate that module with my eyes closed pretty much. So switching it up wasn't,

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:28.080
 it wasn't really worth it to me. But for everything, I was like my clouds and all that stuff. Yeah,

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.240
 definitely one. Parasite's on there. And I'm not at the latest parasite on my clouds.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:37.200
 Me either. I don't want to be calibrated. Right. It seemed like I wasn't super into the new features

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:44.720
 on the surface. Yeah. Indeed. Yeah. I, I read them. I'm like, okay, that's cool. But I'm pretty

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:50.480
 solid with where it's at right now. Yeah. Same. I think it's 1.8. Yeah. Parasite. I think so.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:55.760
 Yeah. And sort of the opposite of that is, I know like the, the audio damage sequencer,

00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.720
 sort of the opposite side of that is there was a lot of promise. There's a lot of cool stuff that

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:07.280
 could come out of it and then it didn't. So out of the box, it was okay. And the idea was like,

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.880
 this is going to be something that's going to be sure worked on, it's going to be evolving and all

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:16.640
 this. And, and when it didn't, it, it doesn't work necessarily as a platform. It doesn't, it

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.120
 isn't that thing that you're going to follow. And you're going to, you know, keep, keep up with

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.040
 like the developments and sure, you're going to have input like, Hey, it'd be cool if you can do the

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:32.960
 X, Y and Z or you can do this. And for sequence or one, it didn't reach my expectations of it.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:39.600
 That's for sure. I mean, communication with the auto damage people on muffler at first was

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:45.440
 pretty good. Like they were asking everybody what features they wanted. I know, I remember,

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:50.960
 I found a couple bugs, a lot of other people found, you know, some small bugs posted on the forums

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.960
 and they like patched it within, you know, weeks came out with a new firmware. And that was cool.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:00.400
 They were, they were fixing things and adding in small things that people were asking for

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:08.720
 at first. But there was still a lot of things that people, I think felt like was promised.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.720
 The sequence or one that never came about. Right.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:18.080
 A lot of that was mostly the generative stuff. I mean, you can't do some generative things with it,

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.720
 but the way it was being discussed, it was like, yes, we're going to go this route and it'll be

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:27.280
 soon. And then like, you know, weeks turned into months, months turned into a year. And it just kind

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:33.760
 of like, you know, the updates were getting fewer and fewer farther between. Yeah. And still didn't

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:40.160
 see the level of stuff that I think we all expected from that, you know. And I don't know,

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.840
 personally, I sold mine. You know what I mean? Eventually I went with the Stilson hammer mark

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:51.280
 too instead. But I felt like right out of the bat, right out of the gate rather, that kind of had

00:46:51.280 --> 00:47:00.560
 more or promising to more. Yeah. But I mean, like, and I never had that. But for me, the ZDSP

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:05.600
 from tip top was early on when I first got it, it had incredible promise. And then there was this

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:12.880
 huge gap where, oh yeah, there was nothing really came out. And now there's now a ton of stuff. So

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:17.600
 it's finally delivering on that promise. But like a lot of that is also not necessarily coming from

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:24.720
 tip top. Right. I wonder if audio damage would benefit from opening that up, going like, hey,

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.520
 we can only do so much. Other people that are fired up to do this probably never happen. Yeah,

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:37.120
 because their code is their code. Like, right. I think they use the same, you know, platform,

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.560
 I should say, across all their effects units. And like a lot of that is ported code from their VSTs.

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.240
 Right. Their software. And like, you know, that's that's their bread and butter right there.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:51.840
 Like Sean Costello from Voila. That's his bread and VSTs were his bread and butter. And then he moved

00:47:51.840 --> 00:48:00.880
 those to ZDSP. Like the XLR draw machine, they're like different forks of that whole thing that do

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:06.560
 different stuff. I've never even played with some of them that do like different generative stuff. But

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.440
 on the whole, some of those features that other people made made it into the main trunk.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.960
 Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest.

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:26.000
